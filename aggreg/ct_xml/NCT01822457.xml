  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled study of patients suffering from intermittent claudication
      (IC), to assess the impact of wearing a Nike FuelBand (NFB) on walking distances, exercise
      levels and quality of life.

      IC manifests as pain in the calf, thigh or buttock muscles when walking. It is caused by
      narrowing or blockage of the blood vessels in the legs.

      The NFB is a discrete wristband with a built-in accelerometer to measure motion. It provides
      estimates of the number of steps taken and the amount of distance covered each day.

      This study will be conducted over a period of 18 months at Imperial College Trust's vascular
      outpatients service. Patients that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be asked to
      consider participating. Participants will receive routine diagnostic work up with the
      addition of having their walking distances measured on a lab treadmill. They will also have
      their functional status and mood assessed using a questionnaire. These assessments will be
      carried out a total of five times over the course of the study. Patients will not need to
      make any additional visits to hospital.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to either the NFB group or the control group. Patients
      in the NFB group will be given a FuelBand with instructions on how to use it. All patients
      will be given routine instructions on maintaining activity and target daily walking
      distances. Target walking distances will be programmed into the NFB. Patients in the NFB
      group will be asked to record estimates of how far they have walked each day directly from
      their band. All patients will be contacted by telephone at a pre-arranged time to collect
      recordings.

      Patients will be followed up at their routine 3-month follow up appointment and additionally
      at 6 and 12 months.

    <description>The Nike Fuel Band (NFB) is a wrist-worn sensor with a built-in accelerometer for motion quantification.  It is programmed to estimate the number of steps taken per day, and also predict energy expenditure in units known as Nike Fuel.  Accompanying software allows the user to set daily targets and monitor their activity through a graphical user interface.</description>
