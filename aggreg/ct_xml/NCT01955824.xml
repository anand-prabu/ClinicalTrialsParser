  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flexible bronchoscopy is a common procedure performed by pulmonary physicians. The use of
      topical anesthesia, analgesia, and sedation during flexible bronchoscopy varies among
      physicians, institutions and geographic locations across the globe. Commonly used topical
      anesthetic agents before and during bronchoscopy  include cocaine (4%),benzocaine (20%),
      tetracaine (1%), and lignocaine (1%-10%). Topical lignocaine is administered through the
      flexible bronchoscope in an attempt to reduce excessive coughing and patient discomfort.
      However, the optimal dosage and strength of topical lignocaine that should be used during
      fibreoptic bronchoscopy has long been a topic of controversy. In this study we compare the
      efficacy of 1% versus 2% lignocaine in controlling cough and pain in patients undergoing
      flexible bronchoscopy.

    <description>Each patient included in study will be nebulized prior to flexible bronchoscopy with 2.5 ml of 4% lignocaine. This will be followed by spray of 2 puffs of 10% lignocaine over the posterior pharynx and vocal cords. Lignocaine jelly (2%) will be applied in the nasal cavity. Lignocaine (1%) 8ml will be administered as &quot;spray as you go&quot; technique through the bronchoscope over the vocal cords, carina, right and left main bronchus as aliquots of 2 ml each. Additional requirement of lignocaine will also be recorded for all the patients.</description>
