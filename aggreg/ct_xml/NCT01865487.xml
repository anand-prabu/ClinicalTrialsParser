      This is a Phase I/IIa, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose- and
      regimen-finding study in healthy adults with and without LTBI, who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV
      negative, and have no history or evidence of TB disease.  The investigational product is
      AERAS-456 at 3 dose levels: 5, 15, and 50ug of H56 antigen with 500 nmol IC31.  The vaccine
      is administered by IM injection.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/IIa, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose- and
      regimen-finding study in healthy adults with and without latent Tuberculosis (TB) Infection,
      who are BCG-vaccinated, HIV negative, and have no history or evidence of TB disease.  The
      investigational product is AERAS-456 at 3 dose levels: 5, 15, and 50ug of H56 antigen with
      500 nmol IC31.  The vaccine is administered by IM injection. The study will be conducted at
      two sites in South Africa.

      A total of 98 subjects will be enrolled in 2 phases into 4 groups based on LTBI status.  The
      initial phase will be a dose ranging study of a 2-dose regimen at 3 dosage levels in LTBI(-)
      subjects, to select a dosage for the second phase.  In the second phase, the study will be
      expanded to evaluate both 2-dose and 3-dose regimens and to include LTBI(+) subjects.  In
      the first phase, 50 LTBI(-) subjects will be enrolled in Group 1 and randomized at a ratio
      of 3:3:3:1 to receive 2 doses of 5/500, 15/500, or 50/500 of AERAS-456, or placebo  given at
      Study Days 0 and 56 (Table 0 1).

      One dose level of AERAS-456 will be selected by the sponsor and SSI for the second phase of
      the study, based on analysis of unblinded safety and immunogenicity data through 28 days
      after the second dose in the first phase, in conjunction with safety and immunogenicity data
      from study C-032-456.  The criteria for dose-selection will be specified in a statistical
      analysis plan to be finalized prior to the unblinded review.  The selected dose, in
      conjunction with the unblinded safety and immunogenicity data, will be submitted to the SMC
      for review.  In the second phase, 48 subjects will be enrolled concurrently into Group 2
      (LTBI[-]) and into Groups 3 and 4 (LTBI[+], Table 0 2).  In each of Groups 2 and 4, 16
      subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 3:1 to receive 3 doses of AERAS-456 or placebo
      given at Study Days 0, 56, and 112.  In Group 3, 16 subjects will be randomized at a ratio
      of 3:1 to receive 2 doses of AERAS-456 or placebo given at Study Days 0 and 56.

      All subjects will stay on the study for 292 days after receiving the first vaccination.  The
      subjects in Groups 1 and 3 will be followed up for 236 days after the second vaccination and
      subjects in Groups 2 and 4 will be followed up for 180 days after the third vaccination.
      The sample size for each study cohort was selected because it was judged to be adequate for
      preliminary safety and immunogenicity evaluations for a Phase I/IIa study rather than for
      statistical reasons.  Given 12 and 15 subjects in individual AERAS-456 dosing groups, the
      study will have an 80% probability of detecting at least 1 specified event which occurs at a
      rate of 12.5% and 10.0%, respectively.  If no such events are observed among 12 and 15
      subjects receiving active study vaccine, an approximation to the upper one-sided 95%
      confidence bound on the rate of occurrence for that event would be 22% and 18%,
      respectively.

    <description>Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be collected on subjects throughout their participation in the study. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events are captured 28 days post each vaccination. Evaluation of the safety profile of AERAS-456 will be performed using data from all subjects who received at least one dose, and will be summarized by cohort and treatment group. The number (percentage) of subjects with any adverse event (including solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events) will be summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and Preferred Term. Additional summaries will present the number (percentage) of subjects with any adverse events by severity and by relationship to study vaccine; parameters evaluable by the Aeras 456 Toxicity Table per US FDA guidance provided in the protocol, will be summarized by severity corresponding to Toxicity Grade, as appropriate.</description>
