            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Once considered to be a rare disorder, hemochromatosis is now recognized to be one of the\n      most common autosomal recessive disorders in white populations. Substantial morbidity and\n      mortality may result from untreated hemochromatosis; thus, early detection and treatment are\n      essential. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the College of American\n      Pathologists now recommend regular screening for hereditary hemochromatosis. Transferrin\n      saturation is regarded as the best single screening test for the detection of individuals at\n      risk for the disorder.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Statistical mixture modeling was used to develop guidelines for hemochromatosis screening\n      regimes and to determine the frequency of the gene for hemochromatosis. The research was\n      designed to provide a statistical foundation for the analysis of population transferrin\n      saturations to assist in development of optimal screening regimens for hemochromatosis. To\n      determine potential screening thresholds, probability methods were applied to data from the\n      third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a cross-sectional\n      probability sample weighted to represent the U.S. population. Statistical mixture modeling\n      was used to determine potential transferrin saturation screening thresholds to identify\n      individuals for repeat testing and possible further evaluation. The actual sensitivity and\n      specificity of these screening thresholds was then assessed using data from a separate\n      demonstration project, \"Cost effective Hemochromatosis Survey in Primary Care\", designed to\n      identify individuals with hemochromatosis. In addition, the gene frequency for\n      hemochromatosis for whites and ethnic subgroups was also determined by analysis of\n      transferrin saturation data from NHANES III.\n\n      The study has two specific aims, as follow: (1) to develop guidelines for the use of\n      transferrin saturation and related tests in detection of individuals at risk for\n      hemochromatosis, and (2) to determine the frequency of the gene for hemochromatosis in the\n      United States by statistical mixture modeling of population transferrin saturation data from\n      NHANES III. Providing the statistical foundation for the analysis of transferrin saturations\n      should facilitate development of optimal, cost-effective screening regimens for\n      identification of individuals requiring further evaluation for hemochromatosis."
