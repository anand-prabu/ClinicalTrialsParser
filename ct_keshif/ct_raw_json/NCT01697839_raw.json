Baseline\n      neuropathic abnormal findings are exacerbated by many myeloma treatments, especially\n      bortezomib, thalidomide, and to a lesser extent lenalidomide. Several studies suggest that\n      vitamin D supplementation may help reduce the symptoms of neuropathy.In this prospective\n      study, we will investigate the relationship between vitamin D and PN among MM patients\n      treated with either bortezomib or thalidomide. The study consists of a screening period of\n      up to 14 days, followed by a single assessment visit to evaluate vitamin D levels, incidence\n      and severity of PN, neuropathic pain, and markers of depression.  Patient charts will also\n      be utilized to assess the frequency of skeletal-related events."
