            "textblock": "The Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between\n      partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health\n      disparities in access to kidney transplantation  among African American End Stage Renal\n      Disease living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this\n      community-based coalition include patients with kidney disease, dialysis facility staff and\n      providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy\n      organizations. The burden of kidney disease is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of\n      kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, the investigators research\n      suggests that racial disparities in access to kidney transplantation are concentrated in the\n      Southeast, where African Americans are less likely to access each step in the transplant\n      process. The long-term goal of the investigators Coalition is to use community- based\n      participatory research approaches to develop, test, and disseminate sustainable, community\n      interventions improve access to transplant for African American patients with kidney\n      disease. The Reducing Disparities in Access to kidNey Transplantation (RaDIANT) community\n      study proposes to use community-based participatory research methods to develop a multilevel\n      intervention to reduce racial disparities in access to kidney transplantation. The long-term\n      impact of this application will be to reduce racial disparities in the kidney disease\n      community."
