Standard chemoradiotherapy consists of 28 daily treatments of\n      radiotherapy. Although this treatment is effective in controlling local symptoms and slowing\n      down the pace of cancer, in most cases it is unable to eradicate the cancer or shrink it\n      well enough to make it operable. Some of the reasons behind this could be the lack of oxygen\n      and lack of blood flow within the tumour that makes it resistant to the effects of\n      chemoradiotherapy. This study is trying to investigate whether increasing the dose of\n      radiotherapy, or increasing the oxygen and blood supply to the tumour by giving an\n      additional drug called Nelfinavir, or a combination of both strategies, can improve outcome.\n      The investigators also want to know what are the additional toxicities from such intensive\n      approaches.\n\n      All patients will initially receive 12 weeks of chemotherapy, and those with stable or\n      responding disease will receive further study treatment as outlined below.\n\n      The study will consist of two stages. In the first stage the investigators aim to find out\n      the right dose of Nelfinavir to combine with chemoradiotherapy, and this will require up to\n      27 patients all of whom will receive Nelfinavir together with standard chemoradiotherapy. In\n      the second stage, the investigators want to find out the benefits of this approach over and\n      above standard treatments and therefore the investigators will recruit approximately 262\n      patients and allocate them to one of the five following treatment arms:\n\n      Arm A: Nelfinavir together with the standard chemoradiotherapy regimen Arm B: Standard\n      chemoradiotherapy Arm C: Nelfinavir together with standard chemoradiotherapy but with a\n      higher radiotherapy dose Arm D: Standard chemoradiotherapy regimen but with a higher\n      radiotherapy dose Arm E: Standard chemotherapy"
