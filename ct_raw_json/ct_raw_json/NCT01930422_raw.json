Care should include education, psychotherapy and treatments, but despite these\n      therapeutics, the smoking cessation process is often characterized by relapses. The main\n      risk factor for relapse is craving. Neurophysiological studies have provided evidence in the\n      understanding of craving. This craving involves surface structures including the\n      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, accessible by neurostimulation. Repetitive neurostimulation\n      applies on this structures involved in craving could therefore modulate it. Two non-invasive\n      stimulation techniques exist: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and\n      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The choice of tDCS is based on its ease of\n      use, excellent tolerance, its better quality of placebo and low cost."
