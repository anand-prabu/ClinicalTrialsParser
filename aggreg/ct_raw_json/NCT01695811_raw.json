Reduced ETDRS-measured, best corrected, distance visual acuity to 20/40 or worse.\n\n          3. Ability to participate in follow-up visits..\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Corneal opacification adequately dense to obscure visualization of iris.\n\n          2. ETDRS-measured, best-corrected, distance visual acuity of 20/30 or better.\n\n          3. Corneal thickness greater than 1200 \u00b5m at the 9 mm peripheral zone.\n\n          4. Severe corneal thinning including descemetocoele with impending corneal rupture.\n\n          5. Prior PKP or incisional surgery that may provide a potential space into which the gas\n             produced by the procedure can escape.\n\n          6. Poor visual potential in the non-study eye (VA of 20/100 or less, without potential\n             for improvement by the examining ophthalmologist's judgment).\n\n          7. History of glaucoma, including steroid response rise in intraocular pressure.\n\n          8. Active intraocular inflammation or infection.\n\n          9. Age 18 or younger (consideration will be given to an upper age limit).\n\n         10. Unable to return for scheduled follow-up examinations.\n\n         11. Other medical condition(s) that will likely prevent long term follow-up."
