      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study to assess the long-term safety and
      efficacy of repeat doses of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who have
      previously participated in controlled studies of dupilumab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:

          1. Underwent at least 4 weeks of study treatment in a prior controlled clinical trial of
             dupilumab for AD (phase 1b through phase 3), and adequately completed the subsequent
             study visits and assessments during the follow-up period (study-specific).

          2. IGA ≤ 2 at baseline in the current study

          3. Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study-related procedures

          4. Able to understand and complete study-related questionnaires

          5. Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria include, but are not limited to, the following:

          1. Patients who, during their participation in any previous dupilumab controlled trial,
             developed a serious adverse event (SAE) potentially related to the study drug

          2. Any adverse event (AE) that led to permanent study drug discontinuation in the prior
             dupilumab study, except if the AE was worsening AD, or if the patient received
             placebo (if known)

          3. Conditions consistent with protocol-defined criteria for patient withdrawal (eg,
             noncompliance, inability to complete required study assessments, etc.)

          4. Treatment with an investigational drug, other than dupilumab, within 8 weeks or
             within 5 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer, before the baseline visit

          5. Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during
             the patient's participation in this study
