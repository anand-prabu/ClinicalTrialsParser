A mismatch between\n      the training program and gait parameters could explain this finding.\n\n      Objective: To evaluate the impact of an isokinetic-strengthening program, matching the\n      requirements of the affected lower-limb muscle groups involved in the energy generation of\n      gait, to a control intervention, on gait performance and muscle strength.\n\n      Hypothesis: The isokinetic training program of the affected lower-limb muscles would produce\n      greater changes in gait performance and strength than a control intervention not aiming at\n      training these muscle groups.\n\n      Design: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial.\n\n      Participants: A convenient sample of 30 individuals with chronic hemiparesis.\n\n      Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned into two groups (n=15), each training\n      three times/week for six weeks. The experimental group trained the affected plantarflexors,\n      hip flexors and extensors concentrically, while the control group trained the affected\n      upper-limb muscles.\n\n      Main outcome measures: Baseline values and post-training values, taken at the end of the\n      training program, of maximal voluntary concentric strength, gait speed and peak positive\n      power."
