Feasibility and preliminary efficacy will be tested using a randomized clinical\n      trial (RCT) with 134 women sex workers meeting eligibility criteria. Following eligibility\n      screening, eligible women will complete informed consent, a baseline assessment, and be\n      randomized to one of 2 study conditions: 1) the combination HIV sexual risk reduction plus\n      microfinance (HIVSRR+MF); or 2) a 4-session HIVSRR alone control condition.\n\n      The study design will permit us to:\n\n        1. Examine and enhance the feasibility (i.e. recruitment, engagement, attendance,\n           retention data collection) of a combination HIV sexual risk reduction and MF\n           intervention with high risk women in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia;\n\n        2. Examine the preliminary outcomes of the interventions on decreasing unprotected acts of\n           vaginal and anal intercourse; increasing the proportion of protected vaginal and/or\n           anal acts using barrier protection and decreasing number of sexual partners with\n           repeated measures at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 3 and 6 month\n           follow-up assessments.\n\n        3. Use the results of the pilot study to inform the design of a future R01 application."
