  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gluococorticoids are commonly prescribed to treat a number of diseases including the
      majority of inflammatory diseases. Despite considerable inter-personal variability in
      responses to glucocorticoids between asthmatics, an insensitivity rate of about 30% and the
      risk of adverse side effects of glucocorticoid therapy, no assay is currently performed to
      determine sensitivity in severe and non-severe asthmatics prior to treatment. The purpose of
      this study is to perform a whole blood ex vivo stimulation assay to interrogate known
      glucocorticoid receptor (GR) up- and down-regulated genes to indicate glucocorticoid
      sensitivity and compare the results between severe and non-severe asthmatics.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria may not be enrolled in the study:

          -  Existence of lung disease (other than asthma)

          -  Recent asthma exacerbation requiring hospital admissions, unexpected healthcare
             visits, or prednisone courses in the previous 4 weeks.

          -  Non-English speaking.

          -  Participation in another interventional research trial
