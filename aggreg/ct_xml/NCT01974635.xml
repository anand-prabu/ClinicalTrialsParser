    <textblock>
      In this study, an FDA-approved device and type of treatment called &quot;AMES,&quot; which stands for
      Assisted Movement with Enhanced Sensation, will be used to determine whether sensation in
      the upper limb of individuals with incomplete spinal cord injuries improves along with
      movement through treatment. We hypothesize that measureable improvement in the sensation of
      upper limb will precede improvement in functional movement.

      The AMES device performs tests of sensorimotor impairment as well as deliver therapy.  In
      this study, we are testing 2 additional diagnostic tests (i.e., Joint Position Test and
      &quot;Frisbee&quot; Test), both of proprioception, in order to determine which of the two is the best
      test of proprioception.  Our hypotheses are: (1) both sensation and movement recover with
      AMES treatment, (2) sensory recovery precedes that of movement, (3) robotic delivery of the
      Joint Position Test produces more reliable test results than does manual delivery of this
      test, and (4) the Frisbee Test results will parallel those of the Joint Position Test.

    <description>During treatment, the AMES device rotates the hand and then the wrist, into flexion and extension, while the patient assists with this motion.  At the same time, the AMES device provides sensory stimulation by vibrating the tendons of muscles stretched by the movement.  The vibratory stimulus switches from one side of the limb to the other when the rotation reverses direction so that the sensory stimulation remains functionally related to the movement. This study provides for 25 AMES treatments over 8-13 weeks, at a rate of 2-3 sessions per week.</description>

    <description>During the therapy session, the AMES device rotates the hand and wrist into flexion and extension, while the patient assists with this motion, as possible.  At the same time, the AMES device provides sensory stimulation by vibrating the tendons of muscles stretched by the movement.  The vibratory stimulus switches from one side of the limb to the other when the rotation reverses direction so that the sensory stimulation remains functionally related to the movement. The subject will receive visual bio-feedback of their contribution to the motor movement.</description>
