The informed consent explains MRI in lay terms, describes the use of contrast\n      agents and lists contraindications to MRI."

In an attempt to evaluate its role, we plan to study a wide range of diseases\n      during the initial year of imaging.  Exposure to magnetic fields and radiofrequency energies\n      of this magnitude have demonstrated no deleterious effects clinically or in the laboratory.\n      The only restrictions will be those imposed by ferromagnetic objects within the patient\n      which would increase the risk of placing them in a strong magnetic field."
