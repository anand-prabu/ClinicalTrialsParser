    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety, activity and best doses of FOLFOX-A which
      consists of the standard chemotherapy drugs fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and
      abraxane. Each of these drugs are currently used in pancreatic cancer.

      The experimental part of the study is combining these drugs together in FOLFOX-A.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More active treatments are desperately needed in pancreatic cancer. The regimen of
      FOLFIRINOX increases survival as compared to gemcitabine but at a cost of increased
      toxicity. Irinotecan is responsible for much of the toxicity of FOLFIROX but may not
      contribute significantly to the regimen's activity. Abraxane is a new agent in pancreatic
      cancer. This albumin-bound nanoparticle form of paclitaxel increases tumor accumulation of
      paclitaxel though binding of albumin to SPARC in pancreatic cancer stroma. The investigators
      therefore propose a pilot study of FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin)
      combined with abraxane to establish the safety and preliminary activity of FOLFOX-A.
      Patients with inoperable (metastatic and locally advanced) pancreatic cancer will be
      eligible since the primary outcome is to establish the safety of FOLFOX-A.

    <description>FOLFOX-A Dose levels -1, 1, 2, 3: Three patients will be accrued to level 1. If no dose limiting toxicities (defined in section 5.2) are observed after two cycles of treatment, then accrual to level 2 will proceed. This procedure will continue until level 3 provided that the MTD has not been reached. If a DLT is observed in one of the first 3 patients in a dose level, then accrual for that level will be expanded to 6 patients. Two or more instances of DLT in a cohort of 6 patients will result in the preceding dose level being defined as the MTD. If dose level 1 is not tolerable then dose level -1 will be investigated. Once the MTD is found, the Principal Investigator will determine which dose should be assessed futher and an additional 10 patients will be treated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

          -  Metastatic or locally advanced disease.

          -  No prior treatment for pancreatic cancer

          -  Radiographically measurable disease.

          -  No major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment. Patients must have
             recovered from the side effects of any major surgery at the start of study treatment.
             Laparoscopy and central venous catheter placement are not considered major surgery.

          -  Patients with serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems
             such that the investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive FOLFOX-A

          -  Preexisting neuropathy &gt; grade 1.

          -  No prior invasive malignancy within the prior two years. However, patients with an
             early stage malignancy that is not expected to require treatment in the next 2 years
             (such as early stage, resected breast cancer or asymptomatic prostate cancer) are
             eligible.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Not pregnant and not nursing. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of
             HCG) within 7 days prior to beginning of treatment.
