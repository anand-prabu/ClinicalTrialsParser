Eligible Hispanic women will be recruited after\n      routine GDM screening and randomly assigned to a Lifestyle Intervention (n=150) or a\n      Comparison Health and Wellness (control) intervention (n=150). The intervention will be\n      based on our efficacious exercise and dietary interventions for Hispanics (R01NR011295; WIC\n      Common Pathways). Multimodal contacts (i.e., in-person, telephone counseling, and mailed\n      print-based materials) will be used to deliver the intervention from randomization (29 wks\n      gestation) to 12 months postpartum. Targets of the intervention are to achieve Institute of\n      Medicine Guidelines for postpartum weight loss; American College of Obstetrician and\n      Gynecologist guidelines for physical activity; and American Diabetes Association guidelines\n      for diet. The intervention draws from Social Cognitive Theory and the Transtheoretical Model\n      and addresses the specific social, cultural, economic, and physical environmental challenges\n      faced by underserved Hispanic women. Measures of adherence will include accelerometers and\n      dietary recalls. The project is a Renewal Application of R01 DK064902, a study of lifestyle\n      risk factors for GDM in Hispanic women. The proposed project builds upon the expertise of\n      the investigative team in conducting randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions\n      among Hispanic pregnant women (R01 DK074876; S3948 ASPH/CDC) and controlled trials of\n      lifestyle interventions among low-income Hispanics with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes\n      (R18 DK0658850; R18DK067549) and can readily be translated into clinical practice in\n      underserved and minority populations."
