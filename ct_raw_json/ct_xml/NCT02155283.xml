    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Kyrobak continuous passive
      motion home-use device in relieving low back pain, improving proprioception (balance and
      fall prevention) and improving the symmetry of muscle function on either side of the spine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Kyrobak is an electrically operated, continuous passive motion device including a
      platform that performs angular oscillations.  The Kyrobak is used at home as an aid to
      relieve mild-to-moderate low back pain.

      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of daily home use of the Kyrobak for 3 weeks
      and to assess the sustained efficacy 1 week later.

      The evaluation will include the level of pain using the numerical rating scale (NRS),
      Digital Posturography, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Static Surface Electromyography (SEMG),
      a condition-specific low back pain disability status by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)
      and subject satisfaction.
