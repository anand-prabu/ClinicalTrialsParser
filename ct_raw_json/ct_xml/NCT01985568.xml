  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the extent to which an exercise intervention
      timed after diet-induced weight loss (rather than initiated at the same time) improves
      exercise adherence and long-term weight loss.  An 18 month randomized trial will be used to
      compare two behavioral weight loss programs; standard behavioral therapy (Standard BT) and
      sequential behavioral therapy (Sequential BT).  The Standard BT group will receive a
      traditional behavioral weight loss program where diet and exercise changes are initiated at
      the same time.  The Sequential BT group will receive a program that focuses solely on
      dietary changes in the initial 6 months, and then incorporates exercise in the ensuing 6
      months.  Both groups will be followed for 18 months to assess long-term weight loss.  Our
      hypothesis is that delivery of diet and exercise interventions in sequence will result in
      improved adherence to exercise and weight loss at 18 months when compared to a traditional
      program in which identical diet and exercise interventions are initiated at the same time.
      This study could identify a strategy that could aid in the development of more effective
      obesity treatment programs and help more people achieve and sustain a weight loss.
