One group of patients will receive lidocaine\n      alone for local anesthesia.  A second group of patients will similarly receive lidocaine\n      prior to tissue sampling, followed by infiltration of the biopsy area with ropivacaine.\n\n      Our hypothesis is that patients who receive a long acting anesthetic (ropivacaine) along\n      with  the popular short acting anesthetic (lidocaine), will be pain free after the breast\n      biopsy procedure for a longer period of time than the patients who only receive lidocaine\n      (the short acting anesthetic). This will lessen the emotional and physical trauma associated\n      with the procedure and give patients a better experience thereby improving patient care."
