Patients are likely to have\n      concomitant nociceptive lower back pain, and cotreatment with opioids, muscle relaxants,\n      benzodiazepines, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at stable doses will be permitted.\n      Patients participating in stable regimen of physical therapy or biofeedback will be\n      eligible.  Procedural interventions (e.g. epidural steroid injection, nerve block, facet\n      radioablation, acupuncture) during the study and 3 months prior will be exclusionary.\n      Anticonvulsants, tramadol, and other antidepressant drugs will be excluded.\n\n      The study is a ten-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of\n      milnacipran (100-200 mg/day dosed twice a day) for radicular pain associated with\n      lumbosacral disk disease.\n\n      Outcome measures and safety assessments will be obtained at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10\n      according to the protocol schedule of assessments."
