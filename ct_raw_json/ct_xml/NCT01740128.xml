  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with spinal cord injury (SCI) retain at least some movement below their injury,
      but their muscles often have a 'mind of their own'. Typical exercise programs focus on
      keeping muscles strong and flexible, but don't usually focus on helping patients control
      their muscles. Our exercise research study will compare two different programs with the
      specific goal of improving conscious control of patients' muscles below the injury. This
      study focuses on those with 'thoracic' SCI - where legs are affected, but not the arms.

      This is a single center study taking place in the Bronx, NY.

      The first phase of the study will be observational - we will analyze which nerve connections
      might remain partially intact through the injury (even if the nerves aren't consciously
      controlled). Participants with all severity of SCI may participate in this first phase.

      The second phase of the study will involve people who retain at least some ability to move
      their legs. Each person will undergo two different exercise rehabilitation strategies:
      weight-supported treadmill training; and balance training combined with skilled hand
      exercises.

      We will compare the effects of these exercise programs on a variety of outcomes, including
      gait speed, balance, strength, and muscle activation in response to brain stimulation.

      We hypothesize that participants with thoracic SCI undergoing combined balance/hand training
      will show improved outcomes when compared to traditional gait or balance training.
