    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross over study to determine the
      efficacy of coconut oil (a proprietary blend of coconut and medium chain triglyceride oils,
      administered orally three times daily) to subjects with Alzheimer's disease who have been
      screened for ApoE 4 allele. The study medication formula is Cognate Nutritionals Fuel for
      Thought™.

      Approximately 65 subjects will be treated with a coconut oil beverage (Fuel for Thought™) or
      placebo for three months, and then given a 3-5 day interim wash out period. After this,
      subjects will resume with three months treatment in opposite treatment arm. Total treatment
      period is 6 months.
