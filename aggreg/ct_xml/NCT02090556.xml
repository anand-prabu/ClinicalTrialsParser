  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the retention rate of Abatacept Subcutaneous (SC)
      over 24 months in routine clinical practice in every participating country depending on the
      treatment line.

      Time Perspective: Other Collection of the baseline data collected at abatacept SC
      initiation, prospectively or retrospectively within maximum 6 months following the first
      administration.

      Others assessments are collected during the follow up period (maximum of 2 years by patient)

      Biospecimen Retention: None retained excepted for a local sub study (in Spain) where sample
      with DNA was retained

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ≥ 18 years old at treatment initiation

          -  Patients informed and accepting to participate

          -  Patients diagnosed with established moderate to severe active RA as per the 1987
             American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria/2010 ACR/European League Against
             Rheumatism (EULAR) Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria

          -  Patients naive of Abatacept Intravenous (IV) and who at their physician's discretion
             are initiated with Abatacept SC. In countries were required (e.g. Germany), patients
             naive of Abatacept IV and who at their physician's discretion have been initiated
             with Abatacept SC at least 1 month prior to enrollment visit up to 6 months if
             baseline and disease characteristics data are available

          -  For Cohort 1: Patients naive of biologic prior to Abatacept SC initiation

          -  For Cohort 2: Patients who previously failed one or more biologic agent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As usual in a non-interventional research conducted to assess usual conditions of
             medical practice, the protocol should not define any specific exclusion criteria
             except prescription of Abatacept SC in the context of clinical trials. As a
             consequence, the following exclusion criteria will be applied:

               -  Patients who are currently included in any interventional clinical trial in RA
