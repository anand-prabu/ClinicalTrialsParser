            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation may be able\n      to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.\n      Sometimes the transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal\n      tissues. Stem cells that have been treated in the laboratory with filgrastim may prevent\n      this from happening. Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells. It is not yet known which treatment is more effective for chronic myeloid\n      leukemia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of donor peripheral stem\n      cell transplantation with donor bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with\n      chronic myeloid leukemia."

Compare the incidence of persistent cytogenetic or hematologic relapse in\n      patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase treated with\n      transplantation using filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells vs bone\n      marrow from HLA-identical, related donors. II. Compare survival and nonrelapse mortality in\n      patients treated with these regimens. III. Compare incidence and severity of acute and\n      chronic graft versus host disease in patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare\n      hospitalization and treatment associated expenses for patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age\n      (15-39 vs 40-65), interval from diagnosis to transplantation (under 2 years vs 2 years or\n      more, and permutations of patient and donor gender. Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive a preparative regimen comprising busulfan orally or\n      IV 4 times daily on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Allogeneic\n      filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Arm II:\n      Busulfan and cyclophosphamide are administered as in arm I. Allogeneic bone marrow is\n      infused on day 0. Patients receive graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis comprising\n      methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and cyclosporine IV over 1-4 hours or orally every\n      12 hours on days -1 to 80 and then tapered. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
