  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Community
      Reinforcement Training (CRT) provided in a group therapy format. The goals of CRT are to
      teach parents behavioral and communication skills to influence their youth's drug use and
      encourage them to enter treatment. Thirty parents will be randomly assigned to Group CRT and
      30 will be randomly assigned to traditional, Individual CRT. Youth engaged in treatment will
      receive individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Families are assessed for adolescent
      substance use and other areas of individual and family functioning. It is expected that
      Group CRT will be more effective for encouraging youth entry into treatment and improving
      parental functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very few youth with drug abuse or dependence in the United States receive treatment. This
      population of untreated youth represents a massive &quot;treatment gap&quot; in adolescent health care
      that renders impotent a potentially important avenue for preventing chronic drug abuse and
      related difficulties. The lack of motivation for treatment characterizing most adolescent
      drug abusers significantly decreases the likelihood these youth will enter treatment,
      barring mandates from the legal system or other social institutions. Efficacy studies have
      demonstrated that Community Reinforcement Training (CRT), an approach that involves teaching
      parents how to engage their youth into treatment, can work to recruit 60-80% of these
      treatment-elusive youth. CRT is traditionally provided in an individual therapy format to
      one or both parents. This study will improve upon our prior work by using a group format to
      provide a less costly procedure for engaging youth into treatment and to make it more
      portable to treatment agencies, schools, juvenile justice, and other community organizations
      seeking to offer support to parents or engage youth in treatment, thus significantly
      increasing the adoption and sustainability of the approach.

      This study will examine the efficacy of the group format (G-CRT) for helping parents engage
      their unmotivated, resistant youth in treatment compared to the traditional individual
      format (I-CRT). Parents (n = 60) will be randomly assigned to G-CRT or to I-CRT. We will
      evaluate the differential efficacy of G-CRT, relative to I-CRT, on rates of adolescent
      engagement in treatment. We expect that G-CRT, compared to I-CRT, will also be associated
      with greater parent encouragement of adolescent sobriety, perceived social support, and
      family functioning. We also predict that changes on these process variables will predict
      increased success in engaging adolescents. We will also examine treatment outcomes for youth
      engaged in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a function of parental involvement in G-CRT or
      I-CRT. We predict enhanced support received by parents in G-CRT will result in greater
      reductions in drug use and lower levels of HIV-risk behaviors, outcomes hypothesized to be
      mediated by motivation to change and sessions attendance. Finally, we will conduct an
      informal cost-effectiveness analysis to derive preliminary estimates of the relative costs
      of each treatment modality per outcome unit and hypothesize that G-CRT will be more cost
      effective than I-CRT by virtue of having higher clinical effectiveness and lower costs.
      Successful outcomes here will provide the basis for a full clinical trial with larger
      samples.

    <description>The TLFB is an interview to assess the quantity, frequency, and pattern of illicit substance use. Parents provide collateral data on their adolescents' substance use in the 3 months prior to enrollment. Adolescents report on their own substance use for the 3 months prior to their parents' enrollment through 6 months after enrollment.</description>

    <description>The MOS consists of four support subscales (Emotional/Informational, Tangible, Affectionate, and Positive Social) and an overall functional social support index. This measure will be completed by parents at baseline (about the 3 months prior to enrollment) and at 3- and 6-month follow-up points. It will be used to compare perceived social support for parents in the G-CRT versus I-CRT interventions.</description>
