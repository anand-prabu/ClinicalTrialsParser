  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective annual release study is designed to evaluate the safety on new influenza
      virus vaccine strains to be included in FluMist Quadrivalent for the 2013-2014 influenza
      season.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled release study will enroll
      approximately 300 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. Eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of trivalent vaccine or placebo by
      intranasal spray. Randomization will be stratified by site. This study will be conducted at
      3 sites in the United States of America. Each subject will receive one dose of
      investigational product on Study Day 1. The duration of study participation for each subject
      is the time from study vaccination through 180 days after study vaccination.
