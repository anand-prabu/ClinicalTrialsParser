All patients will be interviewed by telephone prior to the\n      intervention, by an interviewer blinded to group status, to collect data on current leisure\n      activity and expected activity at 6 months after surgery.  Patients will also complete a\n      questionnaire to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities (American\n      Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Comorbidity Index), pain intensity (0-10 scale),\n      health-related quality of life (SF-12), hip-/knee-specific outcomes (Hip Dysfunction and\n      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score/Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), general\n      expectations (Hospital for Special Surgery Total Hip/Knee Replacement Expectations Surveys),\n      and stage of readiness for change.\n\n      All patients will receive usual medical care before surgery and visit the clinic to meet\n      with the surgeon and nurse/physician assistant, and undergo pre-operative laboratory\n      testing.  Patients in the intervention group will also meet with a member of the research\n      team to complete a 10-item pre-test, to assess knowledge of the key concepts in the\n      intervention, and then be presented with a 20-minute slide presentation.  The presentation\n      will educate patients on the: 1) definition of physical activity and its associated health\n      benefits for the general population and people with arthritis, (2) 2008 Physical Activity\n      Guidelines for Americans, 3) appropriate types of aerobic activities that patients should\n      engage in after THA/TKA (e.g., no- or low-impact activities), (4) appropriate intensity\n      level for activities after THA/TKA (e.g., at least moderate intensity), (5) appropriate\n      duration of participation in activities (e.g., in increments of 10 or more minutes), and (6)\n      the appropriate amount of activity per week (e.g., \u2265 2.5 hours [150 minutes]).\n\n      Patients will then complete a satisfaction survey that will provide feedback on the content,\n      format, and length of the intervention, and a post-test to measure mastery of the\n      intervention material.  The post-test will contain the same questions as the pre-test, but\n      in a different order.  The control group will not meet with the research team during their\n      pre-operative visit.  The control group will receive a written version of the intervention\n      at the end of the study.\n\n      All patients will be re-interviewed by telephone one week after their visit to reassess\n      leisure activity expectations.  Data analyses will be conducted to determine: 1) the\n      direction and magnitude of change expected in leisure activity between baseline and 6\n      months, 2) the change in the proportion of patients who expect to meet national physical\n      activity guidelines 6 month after surgery, and 3) whether or not the intervention modified\n      the type, frequency, duration, or intensity of expected leisure activity from pre- to\n      post-administration."
