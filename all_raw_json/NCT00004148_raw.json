Determine the maximum tolerated dose of the rV-B7.1 vaccine that elicits a host immune\n      response and is associated with acceptable toxicity in patients with malignant metastatic\n      melanoma.\n\n      II. Determine all clinical toxicities associated with this regimen in this patient\n      population.\n\n      III. Determine the safety of this regimen in this patient population. IV. Assess evidence of\n      host antimelanoma immune reactivity following this regimen.\n\n      V. Determine the effect of this regimen on T-cell immunity. VI. Assess the clinical response\n      in this patient population receiving this regimen.\n\n      VII. Evaluate quality of life of these patients during this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive rV-B7.1 intralesionally every 4 weeks for 8 weeks (weeks 0, 4, and 8).\n      Treatment continues every 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression for up to 2 courses.

The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 3 of 8 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, every 4 weeks, and at end of treatment.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months."
