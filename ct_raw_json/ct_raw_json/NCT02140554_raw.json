Diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD), with either \u03b2S/\u03b2S or \u03b2S/\u03b20 genotype.\n\n          3. Have severe SCD. i.e., in the setting of appropriate supportive care measures for SCD\n             (e.g., pain management plan, transfusion regimens, hydroxyurea), as judged by the\n             Investigator, have experienced one or more of the following events:\n\n               -  Recurrent severe vaso occlusive crises (VOC) (at least 2 episodes per year in\n                  the preceding 2 years). To meet this criterion, subjects must have either\n                  experienced hydroxyurea failure at any point in the past (defined as > 1 VOC or\n                  \u2265 1 ACS after taking hydroxyurea for at least 3 months) or must have intolerance\n                  to hydroxyurea.\n\n               -  Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) (at least 2 total episodes in the prior 2 years, with\n                  at least one episode in the past year), defined as an acute event with\n                  pneumonia-like symptoms and the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate. To meet\n                  this criterion subjects must have either experienced hydroxyurea failure or have\n                  intolerance to hydroxyurea, as defined above.\n\n               -  History of an overt stroke. An overt stroke is defined as a sudden neurologic\n                  change lasting more than 24 hours that is accompanied by cerebral MRI changes.\n\n               -  Echocardiographic evidence of a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) of >\n                  2.5 m/s.\n\n          4. Medically eligible to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant  (HSCT).\n\n          5. Karnofsky performance status of \u2265 60.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Positive for any active infection.\n\n          2. Any major organ dysfunction (renal, liver, lung and cardiac abnormalities).\n\n          3. Inadequate bone marrow function, as defined by an absolute neutrophil count of <\n             1000/\u00b5L (< 500/\u00b5L for subjects on hydroxyurea treatment) or a platelet count <\n             50,000/\u00b5L.\n\n          4. Moyamoya disease on cerebral MRI. Subjects with a history of a revascularization\n             procedure for Moyamoya disease (e.g., encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS)\n             procedure) are eligible if the procedure occurred > 1 year prior to study entry.\n\n          5. Contraindication to anesthesia for bone marrow harvesting.\n\n          6. Any prior or current malignancy or immunodeficiency disorder, except previously\n             treated, non-life threatening, cured tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma of the\n             skin.\n\n          7. Prior receipt of an allogeneic transplant.\n\n          8. Immediate family member with a known or suspected Familial Cancer Syndrome\n\n          9. Pregnancy, or breastfeeding in a postpartum female, or absence of adequate\n             contraception for fertile subjects.\n\n         10. Prior receipt of gene therapy."
