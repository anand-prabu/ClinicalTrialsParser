Subjects will be assessed for DLTs from Days 0-28.\n      Dose escalation for newly enrolled subjects, if appropriate, will occur after all subjects\n      in a cohort have completed their Day 28 DLT assessment. After the final patient in the Phase\n      1b portion of the trial has completed their Day 28 DLT assessment, 50 subjects will be\n      enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study and treated with demcizumab at the highest dose\n      level that had < 2 DLTs in the 6 subjects."

In addition, subjects must have a tumor that is\n             at least 1 cm in a single dimension and is radiographically apparent on CT, PET-CT or\n             MRI (i.e., RECIST version 1.1 measurable disease).\n\n          2. Subjects must have platinum resistant disease (i.e., which is defined as disease\n             progression in less than 6 months after receiving a minimum of 4 cycles of a platinum\n             containing regimen).\n\n          3. Subjects with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: Serous\n             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma,\n             undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma,\n             transitional cell carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma N.O.S.\n\n          4. Age >21 years\n\n          5. ECOG performance status <3\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Subjects receiving any other investigational medicinal product or anti-cancer\n             therapy.\n\n          2. Prior therapy with weekly paclitaxel for recurrent disease (administration of weekly\n             paclitaxel as part of an upfront treatment strategy is acceptable as long as the\n             patient had not progressed while receiving weekly paclitaxel or recurred within 4\n             months of receiving weekly paclitaxel)\n\n          3. Non-epithelial ovarian carcinoma, including malignant mixed Mullerian tumors.\n\n          4. For the Phase 1b portion of the study, more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and\n             for the Phase 2 portion of the study more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens.\n             Maintenance therapy following induction chemotherapy does not count as a separate\n             regimen. In addition, hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor)\n             does not count as a separate regimen.\n\n          5. Prior radiotherapy to the pelvis or abdomen\n\n          6. Subjects receiving heparin, warfarin, or other similar anticoagulants.
