            "textblock": "In this study the hypothesis is that the transplantation of Peripheral blood stem cells\n      (PBSC)selectively depleted of TCR alfa beta T lymphocytes would offers some advantages over\n      the use of positively selected CD34+  stem cells because of the presence of other non-stem\n      ancillary cells (in particular Natural killer (NK) and alfa beta  T cells) that might have\n      potential positive effects on the outcome of the transplant.\n\n      The clinical relevance of NK-cell alloreactivity has been demonstrated in adult patients\n      affected by Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and given T-cell depleted HSCT from an\n      HLA-disparate relative where a subgroup of patients had  a particularly low risk of leukemia\n      relapse. These patients belonged to the group transplanted from a donor having NK cells that\n      were alloreactive towards recipient targets i.e. the patient cells express HLA-class I\n      alleles that do not share the inhibiting allelic determinants recognized by Killer\n      immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on donor NK cells. The emergence of this concept of\n      NK-cell alloreactivity has represented a sort of revolution in the field of Haplo-identical\n      hematopoietic stem cell translantation (haplo-HSCT), as the presence of alloreactive NK\n      cells has been shown to positively affect the outcome of transplantation in adults and to\n      display a Graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect that can compensate for the lack of T-specific\n      anti-tumor effect.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the selective\n      infusion of TCR alfa beta T cell depleted graft in pediatric patients affected by malignant\n      or non malignant hematological disorders and receiving an HSCT from a partially matched\n      family donor.\n\n      This study will provide new data on the feasibility and the safety of using a TCR alfa beta\n      T cell depleted graft instead of fully T cell depleted graft to improve the outcome of\n      patients receiving a haplo-HSCT for the treatment of hematological disorders."
