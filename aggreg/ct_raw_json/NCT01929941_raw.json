A goal of Part 1 will be to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of\n      INCB047986 and/or dose(s) that are tolerated doses that produce substantial pharmacologic\n      target inhibition at trough. These doses will be used in Part 2 of the study.\n\n      Part 2 (Expansion Phase) of the study will further explore the safety, tolerability, PK, and\n      preliminary clinical activity of INCB047986 at the doses identified in Part 1,in subjects\n      with advanced malignancies."
