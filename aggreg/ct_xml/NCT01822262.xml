      To explore the therapeutic effects for treatment of cholecystolithiasis by minimally
      invasive cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder reservation and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
      Method： patients with cholecystolithiasis who received minimally invasive
      Cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder reservation and patients with cholecystolithiasis who
      received laparoscopic cholecystectomy(LC) in The Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical
      College from May 2011 to December 2013. Patients who received minimally invasive
      cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder reservation as trial group, patients who received LC as
      control group.the overall follow-up period is 1 year. Then the investigators statistically
      analyze improvement of cholecystolithiasis symptoms in every group, thickness of gall
      bladder wall, the gallbladder function and the rate of the recurrence of cholesterol
      gallstone in trial group.
