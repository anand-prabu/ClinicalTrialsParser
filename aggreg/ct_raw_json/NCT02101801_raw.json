Participants will be\n      asked to ingest a minimal amount of lettuce, carrots, peppers, tomatoes and lettuce during\n      the study period.\n\n      During this period questionnaires will continue and urine samples will be collected every\n      three days. The first compound to be tested will be carbamazepine, as it is stable in water.\n\n      It is important to note that vegetables provided to the participants are available in\n      regular grocery stores.\n\n      Participants will be asked to drink bottled water throughout the study period . A sample of\n      their home drinking water will also be tested for Carbamazepine as will a sample of the\n      vegetables they consume."
