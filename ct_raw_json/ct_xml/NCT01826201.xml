  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether MOL4239 is effective in adult subjects
      with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis by comparing two target lesions in which each subject
      will apply MOL4239 ointment to one target lesion and placebo ointment to the contralateral
      target lesion twice a day for 28.5 consecutive days.

      This is a phase 2a, Randomized, Multi-center, Blinded, Paired Psoriasis Lesion, Comparative
      Placebo-Controlled study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics
      of MOL4239 in 30 adult subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Eligible subject
      will have a diagnosis of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis affecting 9.9% body surface area
      (BSA) or less, and two designated similar target lesions with a Psoriasis Severity Score of
      at least 6 or higher. Each subject will apply 10% MOL4239 ointment to one target lesion and
      placebo ointment to the contralateral target lesion twice a day for 28.5 consecutive days.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change from baseline to day 28 in mean PSS (Psoriasis Severity score) among treatment groups (i.e. MOL4239 versus placebo). The change from baseline will be determined as the difference between the means for the treatment period (day 28) and the baseline.</description>

    <description>Photography of the MOL4239 and placebo treated lesions will be performed at baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28 to assess for the improvement in lesion appearance after drug treatment. The assessment will be completed by a blinded panel of dermatologists experienced in the assessment of psoriasis.</description>

    <measure>Change in EIS area</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Change in Erythema, Induration and Scale (EIS) area.  Total score will be the EIS x Area, and will be calculated at baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28. The EIS will represent the sum of individual scores of Erythema, Induration and Scale using the same scale utilized in the PSS. The area of active erythema, induration and scale will be measured and the total scores will be calculated from the EIS scores multiplied by the area in cm2.</description>

    <measure>Safety assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Safety will be assessed based on reported adverse events, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms, hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis.  Adverse events will be reported throughout the trial. Vital signs will be performed at screening, baseline, prior to the morning dose on Days 0, 1, 7, 14, 28, and at the follow up visit on Day 42. Physical examinations will be performed at Screening, baseline and Day 28.  Hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis will be performed at screening, baseline, Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and at the follow up visit on Day 42.  ECGs will be performed at Screening, baseline and Day 28.</description>

    <description>Plasma MOL4239 concentration-time data at Days 0 and 28. Blood samples will be collected from 5 subjects on Day 0 (serial blood collections at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours post-dose), and Day 28 (serial blood collections at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours post-dose]. Individual pharmacokinetic samples will be taken, analyzed, and parameters will be summarized by descriptive statistics at Day 0 and Day 28. The descriptive statistics will include arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and geometric mean (log-transformed).</description>
