            "textblock": "The investigators goal is to optimise physical activity interventions to help previously\n      inactive women improve their body shape and composition.  Many people seeking to lose weight\n      or improve body composition initiate an exercise programme. The most common recommendation\n      of an exercise intervention for someone attempting to manage their weight, has been to\n      'prescribe' the recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week (World Health Organisation),\n      often using one mode of exercise.  An alternative approach might be to offer a portfolio of\n      activities, from which the exerciser can pick and choose, to facilitate greater amounts of\n      physical activity.  The problem with this is how do you account for the different\n      intensities of walking, washing the car, playing badminton, cycling, jogging, etc?  In this\n      study, the investigators will try to overcome this barrier by allocating a number of\n      \"physical activity points\" to each activity. Using this physical activity points system,\n      participants will be provided with a points target that they can meet using any combination\n      of activities.\n\n      The investigators research aim is therefore to compare this points-based system against the\n      traditional 5x30minute prescription (and sedentary control) for their ability to help\n      previously inactive women to drop a dress size, increase fat burning, positively change\n      their body composition and tone their tummy."
