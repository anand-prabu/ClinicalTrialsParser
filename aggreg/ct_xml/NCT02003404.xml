  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to look at three commercially available ostomy barriers on
      peristomal (around the stoma) skin. Repeated barrier application and removal over years
      causes changes to the skin that the investigators wish to investigate. The primary objective
      is to measure peel force on normal skin and peel force on peristomal skin, with the intent
      of determining if differences occur. The study hypotheses is that no differences exist.

      This is a single center, non-invasive exploratory study utilizing a sample of convenience.
      This study compares three commercially available barrier materials on peristomal skin and
      normal abdominal skin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Colostomy, Ileostomy, or Urostomy patients at least 6 months post-surgery

          -  Males or females, age 18 to 80 years old at the time of enrollment

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 50

          -  Willing to have two  approximately 5&quot; x 5&quot; areas of the abdomen trimmed with a
             surgical clipper -- one in a ring around the stoma, and one on the opposite side

          -  Willing to remain within the testing room for the duration of the study

          -  Willing to allow a third person in the room as a witness for the duration of the
             study

          -  Able to position oneself onto and off of the examining table without the assistance
             of the Investigator

          -  Willing to refrain from vigorous exercise for the duration of the study

          -  Willing to not take any anti-inflammatory medications (except for
             Tylenol/acetaminophen) starting 48 hours prior to the study and for the duration of
             the study

          -  Willing to bring an extra barrier and replace their barrier worn during the study.

          -  Willing to follow the protocol as demonstrated by signing the Informed Consent Form

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator or qualified site personnel is qualified to
             participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant diseases, which may or may not be confined to the testing
             site, that may contraindicate participation; including but not limited to psoriasis,
             eczema, atopic dermatitis, and active cancer

          -  Use of topical drugs on the application site within 1 month.

          -  Use of lotions, creams, powders or oils on the application site in the 24 hours prior
             to application

          -  Pregnancy, lactation or planning a pregnancy as determined by interview only

          -  Other medical conditions, for example uncontrolled diabetes, which in the
             Investigator's judgment, makes the subject ineligible or places the subject at undue
             risk

          -  Participation in any clinical test either using the abdomen as a test site or using
             systemic therapy within the previous thirty days

          -  Damaged skin or other skin conditions in or near test sites which includes sunburn,
             scars, numerous moles or other disfiguration of the test site

          -  Significant adipose tissue at the test site that would preclude adequate adhesion of
             the study devices

          -  Known allergy to any of the test materials
