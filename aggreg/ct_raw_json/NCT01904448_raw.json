            "textblock": "To purpose of this feasibility study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the\n      Nucleus 24 Multichannel Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI, Cochlear Corp, Sydney, AUS) in\n      children without the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type II (NFII) that have either\n      experienced failed cochlear implantation (CI) or have been unable to receive a CI secondary\n      to cochlear or cochlear nerve disorders. These conditions can include: developmental or\n      acquired cochlear nerve deficiency (CND), cochlear aplasia (Michel), post-meningitic\n      cochlear ossification or cochlear malformation.\n\n      This study proposes to implant up to 10 young children (<5 yrs. of age) with the Nucleus 24\n      Multichannel ABI (Sydney, AUS) in an attempt to demonstrate safety of the surgical\n      procedure, tolerance of device stimulation, and the potential for auditory benefit beyond\n      that experienced with their CI. This study will provide the preliminary experience for a\n      larger scale clinical trial.\n\n      Aim 1: Demonstrate the safety of ABI surgery in children. Aim 2: Demonstrate the development\n      of sound awareness and improved speech understanding among children implanted with the ABI\n      when compared to their baseline skills. Aim 3: Demonstrate the development of oral language\n      skills following the use of the ABI that were not evident prior to its use."

Examples might include: Post-meningitis ossification,\n             Bilateral temporal bone fractures with cochlear nerve avulsion, Failed revision CI\n             without benefit\n\n          -  Previously developed open set speech perception and auditory-oral language skills\n\n          -  No medical contraindications\n\n          -  Willing to receive the appropriate meningitis vaccinations\n\n          -  No or limited cognitive/developmental delays which would be expected to interfere\n             with the child's ability to cooperate in testing and/or programming of the device, in\n             developing speech and oral language, or which would make an implant and subsequent\n             emphasis on aural/oral communication not in the child's best interest\n\n          -  Strong family support including language proficiency of the parent(s) in the child's\n             primary mode of communication as well as written and spoken English.\n\n          -  Reasonable expectations from parents including a thorough understanding:\n\n               -  of potential benefits and limitations of ABI\n\n               -  of parental role in rehabilitation\n\n               -  that the child may not develop spoken language as a primary communication mode\n                  or even sufficient spoken language to make significant academic progress in an\n                  aural/oral environment\n\n          -  Involvement in an educational program that emphasizes development of auditory skills\n             with or without the use of supplementary visual communication.\n\n          -  Able to comply with study requirements including travel to investigation sites.\n\n          -  Informed consent for the procedure from the child's parents/legal guardian.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Pre- or post-linguistic child currently making significant progress with CI\n\n          -  MRI evidence of one of the following:\n\n               -  normal cochlea and cochlear nerves or NFII\n\n               -  brainstem or cortical anomaly that makes implantation unfeasible\n\n          -  Clear surgical reason for poor CI performance that can be remediated with revision CI\n             or contralateral surgery rather than ABI.\n\n          -  Intractable seizures or progressive, deteriorating neurological disorder\n\n          -  Unable to participate in behavioral testing and mapping with their CI. If this\n             appears to be an age effect, ABI will be delayed until we can be assured that the\n             child will be able to participate, as reliable objective measures of mapping are\n             currently not available for mapping these devices.\n\n          -  Lack of potential for spoken language development. This will be considered the case\n             when evidence of the following exist:\n\n               -  Severe psychomotor retardation, autism, cerebral palsy, or developmental delays\n                  beyond speech that would preclude usage of the device and oral educational\n                  development. Autism is a special case where there is the potential for delayed\n                  presentation. When early signs are considered present, our group routinely\n                  requests a comprehensive developmental assessment for further evaluation prior\n                  to considering routine evaluation. A specialized group is readily available at\n                  our institution for such an evaluation.\n\n          -  Unable to tolerate general anesthesia (cardiac, pulmonary, bleeding diathesis, etc.).\n\n          -  Need for brainstem irradiation\n\n          -  Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject/family regarding the possible\n             benefits, risks and limitations that are inherent to the procedure and prosthetic\n             device.\n\n          -  Unwilling to sign the informed consent.\n\n          -  Unwilling to make necessary follow-up appointments."
