            "textblock": "Uveal melanomas are melanocytic tumors that arise in the pigmented tissues of the eye: the\n      iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Iris melanomas rarely metastasize (spread to other tissues\n      or organs). In contrast, uveal melanomas arising in the ciliary body and choroid are highly\n      malignant (cancerous and invasive to other tissues or organs). Despite having excellent\n      local tumor control rates, uveal melanoma remains a life-threatening cancer, and even\n      eye-sparing therapy with radiation treatment often leads to significant loss of vision.\n      Therefore patients diagnosed with uveal melanoma must cope with not only a life-threatening\n      illness, but also the frightening prospect of significant vision loss. Choroidal melanomas\n      located in the posterior pole, an anatomical area of the eye which includes the optic nerve\n      and macula (central retina), are of particular concern with regards to visual outcome, as\n      radiation treatment to these areas for even the smallest of tumors is often associated with\n      severe vision loss. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of small choroidal melanomas is\n      critical to patient survival. When tumors with metastatic potential are recognized and\n      treated at an early stage, survival prognosis improves dramatically.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to learn if malignant (life-threatening) choroidal tumors\n      versus benign (non-life-threatening) tumors will show distinct blood vessel patterns using\n      functional optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography. Angiography is the mapping of\n      blood vessels. The investigators believe that OCT angiography can provide data which may\n      help in identifying life-threatening tumors at the earliest stages and improve overall\n      survival for patients with this type of melanoma."

Subjects with\n             benign-appearing and malignant-appearing lesions meeting these criteria will be\n             enrolled.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Inability to give informed consent.\n\n          -  Inability to maintain stable fixation for OCT imaging.\n\n          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring\n             dialysis or kidney transplant.\n\n          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in\n             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular\n             disease, and glycemic control).\n\n          -  Blood pressure > 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110). If blood\n             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, subject can become\n             eligible.\n\n          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment due to unknown safety\n             of fluorescein angiography.  Women that become pregnant during the course of the\n             study may remain enrolled; however, flurorescein and ICG angiography will not be\n             performed until they are no longer pregnant or nursing an infant.\n\n          -  Patients receiving treatment for uveal melanomas will be excluded from the\n             longitudinal natural history portion of this study, but may enroll for a single study\n             visit prior to treatment of their melanoma. They will then be eligible to enroll in\n             IRB 9501, which will follow radiation-treated patients longitudinally."
