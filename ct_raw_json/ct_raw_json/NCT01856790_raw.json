These systems consist of a continuous glucose\n      sensor, which sends a signal to a computer program that automatically determines how much\n      insulin to give.  The computer program then tells an insulin pump to deliver the insulin.\n      While such systems have been tested under a number of conditions, post-meal blood sugars are\n      difficult to control.  This study is designed to see if liraglutide, a glucagon like peptide\n      receptor agonist, can help minimize the post meal blood sugar spikes in subjects with type 1\n      diabetes while they are on a closed loop system."
