      Subjects who are confirmed to meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria during screening period (=&lt;21 days) will be given subcutaneous injections of
      open-label adalimumab 80 mg eow from Week 0 to Week 50. If a subject has an inadequate
      response at or after Week 8, the subject may be withdrawn from the study. Self-injection of
      study drug is permitted for the subjects who are willing to perform self-injection, if the
      investigator decided as appropriate. Disease activity will be evaluated by Crohn's disease
      activity index (CDAI) at Screening, Week 0 and every 4 weeks until Week 52.  Follow-up will
      be performed at 70 days after the last dose of study drug by visit or telephone etc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject &gt;=15 years of age at the time of informed consent.

          -  Subject with Crohn's disease who received induction treatment of commercially
             available Humira® (160 mg initially and 80 mg at 2 weeks after initial dose),
             achieved response after initial dose, and then lost response during maintenance
             treatment with Humira®.

          -  Subject with elevated CRP at Screening.

          -  If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy) or is of childbearing potential and is practicing
             an approved method of birth control throughout the study and for 150 days after the
             last dose of study drug.

          -  Subject has a negative Tuberculosis (TB) Screening Assessment.  If the subject has
             evidence of a latent TB infection; the subject must initiate and complete a minimum
             of 21 days of an ongoing TB prophylaxis (in such case, screening period can be
             prolonged until 21 days past after initiation of prophylaxis and study drug is
             administered) or have documented completion of a full course of TB prophylaxis, prior
             to Week 0.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with suspicion of colitis other than Crohn's disease.

          -  Subject with an ostomy or ileoanal pouch. (Subjects with a previous ileo-rectal
             anastomosis are not excluded).

          -  Subject with abscess or suspicion of abscess, or subject with infection(s).
