            "textblock": "Functional recovery following SCI in adults is limited. Improvements in the quality of life\n      of affected persons are associated with the recovery of functions that allow independent\n      living, for example use of the arms and hands. Rehabilitative training has been shown to aid\n      upper limb recovery however, there are likely vast differences in the amount of time\n      individuals spend actively training (during rehabilitation sessions in the clinic) and what\n      they do in their non-training time (during daily life). The activity, or lack of, during the\n      non-training period could interfere (positively or negatively), with the specific training\n      in the rehabilitation session. However, there is little information available about this.\n\n      Inertial measurement units are increasingly being used in human movement and rehabilitation\n      research. The use of such technology is a promising approach to rapidly and discreetly\n      collect objective movement information. The investigators plan to introduce a novel,\n      long-term, activity sensor into clinical SCI rehabilitation. The investigators use this\n      sensor to precisely measure movement of the upper limb over extended periods of time. Upper\n      limb activity recordings from these sensors allow us to detail the amount and duration of\n      activity during specific periods of upper limb rehabilitation and recovery.\n\n      The investigators aim is to measure upper limb activity. The investigators aim to track\n      changes in the activity of the upper limb during recovery and rehabilitation in patients\n      with cervical SCI. The recordings from this activity sensor will provide a more detailed\n      understanding of how everyday upper limb activity contributes to functional recovery."
