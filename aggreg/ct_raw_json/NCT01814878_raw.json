Participants\n      will be administered 2 tablets of ER tramadol HCl (75 milligram [mg])/acetaminophen (650 mg)\n      along with 2 tablets of placebo matching to IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in study drug\n      treatment group; and 2 tablets of IR tramadol HCl (37.5 mg)/acetaminophen (325 mg) along\n      with 2 tablets of placebo matching to ER tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in comparator treatment\n      group respectively at 0, 12, 24 and 36 hours.
