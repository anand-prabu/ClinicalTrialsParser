            "textblock": "Background PTSD and AUDs are highly prevalent psychiatric disorders among combat Veterans\n      that can lead to substantial impairments and disability. Although empirically supported\n      treatments are available, the majority of Veterans suffering PTSD or AUDs do not engage in\n      any mental health care. Data show that encouragement and support by family members play a\n      key role in Veterans' willingness to engage in mental health care. However, many family\n      members may not know how best to help their Veterans engage in mental health care. VA-CRAFT\n      is an innovative adaptation of an empirically supported family training intervention (CRAFT)\n      that has been shown to dramatically increase treatment engagement among substance abusing\n      civilian samples.  VA-CRAFT includes Veteran-specific content, a focus on PTSD, SUDs, or\n      both, and also make use of interactive web-technology to increase its efficiency and reach.\n      Pilot research is needed to begin to evaluate the effectiveness of this adaptation of an\n      existing, efficacious intervention, to provide feedback to VA-CRAFT developers for possible\n      modifications to content and delivery, and to inform future studies.\n\n      Objectives Specific aims are to: 1) provide pilot data on the effectiveness of VA-CRAFT on\n      Veterans' mental health service utilization; 2) provide pilot data on the effectiveness of\n      VA-CRAFT on family members' wellbeing, personal quality of life, perceived relationship\n      quality with Veteran, and communication about treatment seeking; 3) obtain pilot data to\n      explore possible differences in intervention response between Veterans with AUDs only, PTSD\n      only, or both; and 4) provide information regarding potential changes in content and\n      delivery as well as mediators and moderators of outcome for VA-CRAFT.\n\n      Methods This is a randomized controlled trial of VA-CRAFT that will obtain preliminary\n      information on its effectiveness and pilot information to inform future studies.\n      Participants will be drawn from a cohort of Veterans and family members enrolled in the\n      Readiness and Resilience in National Guard Soldiers studies (RINGS; Polusny & Erbes, PIs).\n      Using Veterans' responses to post-deployment RINGS surveys and administrative data, family\n      members of Veterans who screen positive for PTSD or AUDs will be recruited and divided into\n      1 of 3 subsamples:  1) family of Veterans with AUDs only (anticipated n = 38), 2) family of\n      Veterans with PTSD only (anticipated n = 72), and 3) family of Veterans with both PTSD and\n      AUDs (anticipated n = 74; total anticipated N =184 across the 3 subsamples). Family member\n      participants will complete baseline questionnaires of perceived Veteran PTSD and AUD\n      symptoms, family functioning and communication, and well-being and will be randomly assigned\n      to VA-CRAFT or Control (no treatment) conditions. Those assigned to the VA-CRAFT condition\n      will complete the online VA-CRAFT course.  Progress through VA-CRAFT will be monitored and\n      stepped outreach efforts (emails, phone contacts) will be systematically used, as necessary,\n      to promote completion of the intervention. Three months after the baseline assessment,\n      family members and Veterans will complete follow-up questionnaires. Primary outcomes will\n      include: 1) Veteran's mental health service utilization during the 3 months following\n      initiation of VA-CRAFT as assessed by VA administrative data and 2) family member\n      self-reports of wellbeing and quality of life and 3) family and Veteran reports of perceived\n      relationship quality and communication about treatment seeking. Effect sizes will be\n      estimated for each outcome within each subsample of participants (AUD only, PTSD only, and\n      comorbid) and, if patterns are similar within subsamples, for the sample overall.  Following\n      the post-intervention questionnaires, qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 40\n      family participants to examine possible moderators and mediators of treatment responses and\n      to elicit participant feedback on VA-CRAFT modules and development to inform future VA-CRAFT\n      development."
