A lesion will be considered to be\n      completely cured if 100% re-epithelialization is observed.

Have non-complicated, non-severe CL.\n\n          3. Be able to give written informed consent or by their legal representative.\n\n          4. Have a diagnosis of CL in at least one lesion by at least one of the following\n             methods: 1) positive culture for promastigotes; 2) microscopic identification of\n             amastigotes in stained lesion tissue and/or 3) by positive polymerase chain reaction\n             (PCR). Patients who have a prior diagnosis of CL within 30 days of the start of\n             treatment are eligible without a confirmatory test during screening.\n\n          5. Have at least one ulcerative lesion  \u2265 1 cm and < 5 cm, that meets the criteria for\n             an index lesion.\n\n          6. Be willing to forego other forms of treatments for CL including other investigational\n             treatment during the study.\n\n          7. In the opinion of the investigator, be capable of understanding (or their legal\n             representative) and complying with the protocol.\n\n          8. Expect to be located in the area of the clinical site for at least the duration of\n             the screening, 20-day treatment period, and for the followup visits at Days 28 +/- 2\n             days,  42 +/- 7 days and  100 +/- 14 days.\n\n          9. If female and of child-bearing potential, have a negative serum or urine pregnancy\n             test during screening and agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during\n             the treatment phase and for 1 month after treatment is completed.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Also, to be eligible for the study, patients must not:\n\n          1. Have a prior diagnosis of leishmaniasis where all lesions had healed.\n\n          2.

Have a lesion due to leishmania that involves the mucosa or palate.\n\n          4. Have signs and symptoms of disseminated disease.\n\n          5. Be a female who is breast-feeding.\n\n          6.

Have received treatment for leishmaniasis (except mercurochrome or local antiseptics)\n             including any medication with pentavalent antimony including sodium stibogluconate\n             (Pentostam), meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime); amphotericin B (including liposomal\n             amphotericin B and amphotericin B deoxycholate); WR 279,396; or other medications\n             containing paromomycin (administered parenterally or topically) within 56 days of\n             starting study treatments, or methylbenzethonium chloride (MBCL); or local or\n             systemic antibiotics of the following families (penicillin, betalactamics, cyclines,\n             synergistin, macrolides, lincosamides, fusidic acid, mupirocin) within 8 days of\n             starting study treatments.\n\n          9.
