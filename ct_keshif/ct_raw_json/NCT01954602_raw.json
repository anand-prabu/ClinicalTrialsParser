            "textblock": "The most common technique used to achieve primary deep biliary cannulation is the standard\n      contrast-assisted method, in which a catheter or sphincterotome is introduced into the\n      papilla in the direction of the bile duct and a contrast medium injected to confirm that the\n      duct has been cannulated.\n\n      The biliary guidewire cannulation technique consists of the introduction of a guide-wire\n      into the bile duct instead of contrast injection as the first maneuver.\n\n      The benefit of this technique, compared with classic contrast cannulation, has been\n      demonstrated in several studies which show similar results and have been analyzed in a\n      recent meta-analysis, including 5 studies and 1762 patients, and demonstrating that the use\n      of the guide-wire technique significantly improved the primary cannulation rate from 74.9%\n      to 85.3%. More importantly, significantly reduced the incidence of PEP from 8.6% to 1.6%.\n\n      There are several variations of this technique; the tip of the sphincterotome is inserted\n      initially a few millimeters through the papillary orifice and then introduce the guide-wire\n      to the target (\"touch technique\"). Another variation is direct cannulation with the\n      guide-wire hovering a few millimeters through the catheter or sphincterotome (\"no touch\n      technique\").\n\n      To date, there are no randomized controlled trials comparing the two above described way to\n      access to biliary duct regarding efficacy and rate of complications."
