The part A will\n      evaluate the change in peripheral circulating CD34+ cells in response to two different 5 day\n      regimens of ronacaleret (100 mg or 400 mg once daily), given in conjunction with a single\n      dose of plerixafor (0.24 mg/kilogram [kg]) sub-cutaneously (SC) on the evening of the final\n      days dosing approximately 12 hours before collection of CD34+ cells on day 6. Subjects (5\n      each) will be assigned to either one of the ronacaleret arms, in an open fashion.\n      Comparisons will be made in the change from baseline to end of treatment peripheral CD34+\n      cell counts. Part A will be conducted in two cohorts with 5 subjects being enrolled into\n      each of the 2 treatment arms making up the first cohort. Cohort 2 will involve up to 5\n      further subjects being enrolled into each treatment arm.\n\n      The structure of part B will be finalized following a review of data generated in part A.\n\n      The total study duration of Part A for each subject including the screening, treatment and\n      follow-up periods will be approximately 7 weeks."
