Nonetheless, after finishing recording the\n      evoked potential responses during surgery, facilitation of recovery from general anesthesia\n      is getting important, because the real neurological physical examination is much more\n      sensitive than above electrical evoked potentials to evaluate the results of surgical\n      operation.\n\n      We propose to evaluate the recovery parameters after conversion from total intravenous\n      anaesthesia technique to Desflurane anesthesia during long term neurosurgery procedures. The\n      conversion will be initiated upon completion of the  neurophysiological electric evoked\n      potentials assessment. Based on the pharmacological properties of desflurane, we hypothesize\n      that recovery after conversion to Desflurane will be faster compared to recovery after total\n      intravenous anaesthesia alone."
