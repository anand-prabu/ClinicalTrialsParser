Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells. Biological therapies such as interleukin-2 use different ways to stimulate\n      the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation, and interleukin-2 in treating patients who have solid tumors or\n      lymphoma."

Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) alone on\n      days 3-9 and GM-CSF and filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 10 and continuing until\n      leukapheresis is completed.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy comprising oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to\n      -6, melphalan IV on days -5 and -4, and thiotepa IV on days -3 and -2. Autologous peripheral\n      blood stem cells (PBSC) are treated ex vivo with interleukin-2 (IL-2) on day -1. Patients\n      undergo IL-2-treated autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0.\n\n      Beginning 4 hours after PBSC transplantation, patients receive IL-2 IV continuously for 5\n      days. IL-2 therapy repeats every 7 days for 4 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed on days 60-80, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
