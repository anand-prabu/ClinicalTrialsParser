  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to test the efficacy of a new intervention to improve clinical judgment.
      The investigators focus on the assessment of pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD), a
      controversial diagnosis with frequent diagnostic errors, by educating mental health
      professionals in common cognitive pitfalls and training them in recommended de-biasing
      strategies. The investigators hypothesize that the Treatment group will show higher
      diagnostic accuracy than the Control condition: Participants receiving the cognitive
      de-biasing intervention will be less likely to commit faulty heuristics and race/ethnicity
      bias. Secondary aims include soliciting feedback about whether the skills were useful when
      diagnosing the vignettes, and whether skills and cases seem clinically realistic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 100 participants will test the efficacy of a new
      intervention to improve clinical judgment.

      Eligible participants will be licensed or currently supervised by a licensed mental health
      professional and have experience working with pediatric populations.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either Treatment or Control conditions. All
      participants receive a 5 minute pre-recorded presentation about mood disorders, then read
      several case vignettes and respond to questions regarding judgments about probable diagnoses
      and next clinical actions.

      Study administration is Web-based via a secure portal. After answering questions to confirm
      eligibility and provide informed consent, participants will complete a background
      questionnaire. The Web software, Qualtrics, will randomize participants to watch a brief
      presentation on mood disorders (i.e., Control condition) versus the same presentation on
      mood disorders combined with the intervention (i.e., Treatment condition). The intervention
      is a 20-minute training on decision-making errors and cognitive de-biasing strategies.

      Next, all participants review four clinical vignettes. Using only four vignettes reduces
      participant burden and maximizes response rate. Qualtrics presents the case vignettes in
      random orders.

      After completing the last vignette and corresponding questions, participants in the
      treatment condition rate their experience of the intervention. These questions address the
      secondary study aims: (a) how participants will use these new techniques in their clinical
      practice; and, (b) how the investigators can tailor the intervention to make it even more
      user-friendly and appealing to clinical audiences.

    <description>Participants in treatment and control conditions report vignette characters' probable diagnoses after reading each vignette. These diagnoses were rated on a 3-point Likert scale of (1 = inaccurate diagnosis, 2 = somewhat accurate, and 3 = accurate diagnosis) using criteria established by the research team (which includes expert diagnosticians).</description>

    <description>Participants in the treatment group complete a brief questionnaire (4 items) about their attitudes toward the cognitive de-biasing intervention. This measure describes different aspects of the intervention (e.g., how helpful it was in making diagnostic decisions), and requires participants to make ratings on a 6-point scale: (1) strong agree; (2) agree; (3) somewhat agree; (4) somewhat disagree; (5) disagree; and, (6) strong disagree.</description>
