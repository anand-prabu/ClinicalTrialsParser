            "textblock": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common disease caused by hormonal\n      imbalance and is also associated with overweight and obesity.  It affects 5-10% of\n      adolescent girls and women capable of having children.  PCOS is associated with missed\n      menstrual periods, hormonal imbalance, being overweight, and with a form of diabetes. Girls\n      with PCOS may have a breathing problem known as \"sleep apnea.\" Sleep apnea may cause a\n      person to stop breathing for short periods of time while sleeping. People with PCOS are\n      thirty times more likely to develop sleep apnea than those who do not have PCOS. If sleep\n      apnea is not treated, it may lead to daytime sleepiness, poor school performance, high blood\n      pressure, heart disease and diabetes. The purpose of this study is to understand how insulin\n      function is affected in presence of sleep apnea in girls with PCOS between 13-18 years of\n      age as compared to girls with PCOS without sleep apnea. Insulin is one of the hormones made\n      in your body to convert food into energy. In people with increase weight body cannot use\n      insulin properly. The investigators also want to see if insulin action is also affected by\n      sleep apnea."
