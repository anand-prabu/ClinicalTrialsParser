             consent or be able to use the decision aid

          -  Planning to enter a long-term care facility (e.g. nursing home) where medications
             will be administered by clinical personnel after hospital discharge

          -  Enrolled in other studies that require prolonged participation and follow-up

          -  Unable to speak Greek at a level necessary to complete the patient surveys and ensure
