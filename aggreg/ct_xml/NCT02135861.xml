  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel blockade may be promising in the
      treatment of pulmonary oedema and dyspnoea in heart failure (HF) patients by re-establishing
      the alveolar septal barrier. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) is an established technique for assessing changes in vascular permeability and
      interstitial water volume. The aim of this study is to establish the potential utility of
      DCE-MRI as a novel endpoint for dose ranging and proof of mechanism studies of TRPV4
      blockers. The DCE-MRI markers of vascular permeability and pulmonary oedema will be measured
      in HF patients and healthy volunteers (HV) at rest to determine if there is a difference
      between the two populations. In addition, exercise induced changes relative to rest in
      interstitial volume and exchange rate will be evaluated in both HV and HF patients.

      This study will enrol a sufficient number of subjects to have up to 24 evaluable subjects
      (up to 12 HV and up to 12 HF patients). An evaluable subject is defined as a subject that
      has MRI data of sufficient quality to enable DCE-MRI modelling both Scan Visit 1 and Scan
      Visit 2. The study will consist of five visits wherein the first visit will be a screening
      visit. The second visit will be the first scanning visit and will take place within 35 days
      of the first visit. The third visit/second imaging will take place after approximately one
      week. Third imaging visit will incorporate a bicycle exercise challenge prior to imaging and
      will occur approximately one to three days after the second imaging session. The final
      contact will be a follow-up phone call, which will take place up to 1 week later.
