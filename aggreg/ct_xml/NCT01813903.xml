      Lifestyle habits during pregnancy have long-term effects of baby's as well as mother's
      health. Pregnancy period is a favorable time for lifestyle changes, as the parents usually
      have motivation and assets to change lifestyle. Maternity welfare clinic is the place to
      promote healthy lifestyles because most Finnish families expecting child visit there at
      regular intervals.
