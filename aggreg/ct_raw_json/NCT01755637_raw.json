Due to extensive metabolism and limited\n      absorption, plasma concentration of ABZ after oral administration was found to be too low to\n      be measured.

Current or relevant previous history of serious, severe or unstable physical or\n                  psychiatric illness, any medical disorder that may require treatment or make the\n                  subject unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition that presents\n                  undue risk from the study medication or procedures;\n\n               3. History of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer;\n\n               4. Asthma\n\n               5. History of liver disease\n\n          4. Medication\n\n               1. Use of any drug known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism in the 30\n                  days prior to dosing\n\n               2. Current or regular use of any prescription or over-the-counter medication, any\n                  other ABZ containing products, and traditional Chinese medicine.\n\n          5. Smoking\n\n               1. Subjects who are current smokers or non-smokers of less than 3 months;\n\n               2.
