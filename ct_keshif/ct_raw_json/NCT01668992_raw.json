The\n      methodology used in the impact evaluation study is a randomized waitlist controlled trial.\n\n      The study hypothesizes that participation in a family-based intervention will lead to\n      improved parenting practices and child and family outcomes, as follows.\n\n      Primary hypotheses:\n\n        1. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report increased\n           knowledge and use of positive parenting skills compared to control;\n\n        2. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report less use\n           of physical punishment and other harsh forms of discipline compared to control;\n\n        3. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will\n           report higher levels of family functioning and cohesion compared to control.\n\n      Secondary hypotheses:\n\n        1. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will\n           report lower levels of externalizing and internalizing child behaviors compared to\n           control;\n\n        2. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will\n           report higher levels of child resilience and psychosocial well-being compared to\n           control;\n\n        3. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report lower\n           levels of alcohol use compared to control."
