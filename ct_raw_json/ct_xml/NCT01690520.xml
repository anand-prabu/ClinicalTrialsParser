    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well donor umbilical cord blood transplant with
      or without ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells works in treating patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or
      myelodysplastic syndromes. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor
      umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's cells. When the healthy stem cells and
      ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells are infused into the patient they may help the
      patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It
      is not yet known whether giving donor umbilical cord blood transplant plus ex-vivo expanded
      cord blood progenitor cells is more effective than giving a donor umbilical cord blood
      transplant alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the time to neutrophil engraftment (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt;= 500) in
      patients receiving a standard of care myeloablative cord blood transplant (CBT) augmented
      with an off-the-shelf pre-expanded and cryopreserved cord blood product to those who do not
      receive the product.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Provide initial data on clinical and economic benefit, such as time to platelet
      engraftment, duration of initial hospitalization, day 200 transplant related mortality
      (TRM), death without engraftment, and incidence of severe infections in the first 100 days
      post-transplant.

      II. The kinetics of immune system recovery will also be evaluated in both arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Standard of Care Arm:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days -8 to -6 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 to -6. Patients also undergo
      total-body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -4 to -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo single-unit or double-unit unmanipulated umbilical cord blood
      (UCB) transplant on day 0.

      GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 1 hour
      BID (adults) or thrice daily (TID) (children) on days -3 to 100 with taper beginning on day
      101. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) IV TID on days 0-7 then may receive
      MMF orally (PO) TID. Patients remain on MMF TID for a minimum of 30 days, and then may begin
      taper if there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and are well-engrafted
      from one donor unit.

      Experimental Arm:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV and cyclophosphamide IV, and
      undergo TBI as in Standard of Care Arm.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo single-unit or double-unit unmanipulated UCB transplant on day
      0. Patients also receive an infusion of ex vivo-expanded cord blood progenitors at least 4
      hours after completion of UCB transplant.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine IV and mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO as in
      Standard of Care Arm.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
