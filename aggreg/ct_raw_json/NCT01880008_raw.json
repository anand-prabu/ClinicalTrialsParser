Even after\n      multimodal therapy, outcomes remain poor, with a median survival of one year.   Although\n      advanced imaging methods have been suggested as molecular markers of prognosis and\n      therapeutic response, these methods have not been validated for clinical use.  In this\n      exploratory, imaging-based, trial, thirty patients with a pathological diagnosis of\n      glioblastoma will be followed prospectively for two years.  The study examines how PET and\n      MR imaging signals change following administration of a standard radio-chemotherapy\n      treatment regimen to determine whether these imaging modalities can provide early indicators\n      of response to therapeutic intervention.  The investigators hypothesize that decreases in\n      uptake of an investigational 18F-FLT PET tracer following treatment with radiation and\n      chemotherapy will be a reliable predictor of glioblastoma response. In a more exploratory\n      fashion, the investigators also will identify changes in diffusion and hypoxia MR imaging\n      that may also correlate well with treatment response."
