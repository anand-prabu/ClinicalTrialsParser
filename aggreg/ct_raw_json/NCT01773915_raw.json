Currently, some biochemical tests performed on Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) samples\n      have demonstrated to discriminate to some extend between AD and non-AD individuals based on\n      the levels of tau, phospho-tau or A\u03b242. We aim to investigate newly identified  proteins\n      whose levels increase during the Braak Stages of AD that are accessible in other body fluids\n      such as blood, urine or saliva. The detection of these proteins would allow performing\n      simple tests in case its levels were confirmed to be associated with the AD pathology."
