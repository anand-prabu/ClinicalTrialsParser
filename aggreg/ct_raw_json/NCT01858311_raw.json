In patients with recurrent\n      stroke, severity of the stroke and stroke size measured from MR (magnetic resonance) or CT\n      (computed tomography) imaging will also be collected. We expect that TCT will inhibit blood\n      clotting and lower cholesterol more than current standard treatment without significantly\n      increasing bleeding risks or other side effects. Future work is planned in a larger\n      TIA/stroke population to examine whether TCT adds to standard medical care in terms of\n      decreasing incidence of stroke and improving outcomes following stroke."
