A secondary\n      purpose is to evaluate sampling methods for collecting breast milk samples in a community\n      setting. The results of this pilot study will allow us to determine whether milk retinol is\n      a useful indicator for evaluating the impact of food-based interventions on the vitamin A\n      status of lactating women."
