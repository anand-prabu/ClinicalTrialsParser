            "textblock": "Mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS (MTCT) is still a major contributor to the burden\n      of HIV infections among infants and children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Among the major\n      challenges of each approach to achieving maximum benefits is late and incomplete antenatal\n      care (ANC) attendance. While attendance to one ANC visit is almost universal, only about\n      half of pregnant women attend the four WHO-recommended visits. Moreover, those that attend\n      often book late in pregnancy. This nationwide challenge can lead to delays or interferences\n      with the appropriate PMTCT medications for mothers \u2014thus substantially diminishing the\n      potential of PMTCT care to reduce mother-to child-transmission of HIV in Tanzania.\n\n      The investigators will examine the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and\n      acceptability of an enhanced community health worker intervention and outreach system for\n      pregnant women to facilitate early and consistent ANC attendance, early and effective PMTCT\n      uptake, with the aim to further reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV. We will test the\n      effectiveness hypothesis in a cluster-randomized controlled trial; the unit of randomization\n      is the administrative unit of a ward, which is the geographical unit below a district in the\n      Tanzanian government system. We randomly allocate all 60 wards in two of the three districts\n      in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania -- Kinondoni and Ilala districts -- to receiving the enhanced\n      community health worker intervention and outreach system vs. receiving the standard of care\n      in the Tanzanian public-sector health system.\n\n      The results of this study will inform implementers and policy makers on whether and how a\n      community outreach system and PMTCT algorithm may maximize benefits of antenatal care and\n      PMTCT services in Tanzania and inform decisions surrounding future maternal and newborn\n      health programs moving forward.\n\n      This study was initially designed to test both the effectiveness of the enhanced CHW\n      intervention and outreach system and the effectiveness of WHO PMTCT option B (vs. A) in\n      ensuring successful PMTCT in the Tanzanian public-sector health system. However, in reaction\n      to a report of non-compliance by the investigator team (incomplete records of written\n      informed consent among PMTCT patients in the public-sector PMTCT clinics) the IRB at the\n      Harvard School of Public Health decided to stop involvement in the option A vs. B component\n      of this study. The IRB approved continuation of the enhanced CHW intervention and outreach\n      system in the study."
