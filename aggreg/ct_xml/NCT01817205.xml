      The objective is to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effect of combined hyperthermia and

    <textblock>
      Most patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an intermediate and
      advanced stage when the tumors become unresectable. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) has been shown to be effective in prolongation of survival for patients with
      unresectable HCC and generally adopted as a standard palliative treatment option for
      patients with intermediate stage HCC. However, the therapeutic effect of TACE in terms of
      objective tumor response is variable and modest (27%-40%), indicating that there is actually
      much room for improvement in the treatment. In many cases, patients with intrahepatic HCC
      uncontrolled after TACE treatment may not be suitable for other treatment options because of
      their physical condition. For these patients, repeat TACE combined with adjuvant systemic
      hyperthermia may offer a chance of disease control.
