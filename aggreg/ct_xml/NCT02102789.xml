    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if systemic chemotherapy combined with
      hepatic arterial infusion with Floxuridine and Dexamethasone can increase the complete
      resection rate (R0) and the overall survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients with
      previously unresectable liver-only metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies and our experience have proved the efficacy and safety of systemic
      chemotherapy combined with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with Floxuridine and
      Dexamethasone in the treatment of  previously unresectable liver-only metastases from
      colorectal cancer. However, most of the reports are  retrospective studies, phase I or II
      clinical researches. we proposed a further study to determine if systemic chemotherapy
      combined with HAI can increase the complete resection rate (R0) and the overall survival in
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients with initially inoperable hepatic-only metastases.
