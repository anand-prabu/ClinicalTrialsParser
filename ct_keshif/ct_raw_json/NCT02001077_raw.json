The objective of the study is\n      to examine the impact of two behavioral treatments on sleep and pain and to better\n      understand what causes chronic pain and chronic sleep disturbance."

Participants with poor sleep will visit the University of Florida for a\n      medical history and will be connected to a machine which will monitor their sleep.\n      Participants will return home to sleep while still connected to the machine and will return\n      the machine to the University of Florida the next day.  A third visit will consist of\n      completing questionnaires and measuring response to a range of temperatures.  Participants\n      will complete brief daily questionnaires and wear an actigraph (wristwatch-like device) that\n      measures arm movements for two weeks.\n\n      Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: a pain treatment group, an\n      insomnia treatment group or a waitlist control group. Both treatments consist of  weekly\n      therapy sessions for 8 consecutive weeks.  Participants assigned to waitlist control will be\n      offered therapy at no cost at the end of the study.  Throughout these 8 weeks, participants\n      in all three groups will be asked to complete daily sleep diaries.\n\n      The study consists of two follow-up periods consisting of two weeks, during which\n      participants will wear the actigraph and complete daily sleep diaries.  Participants will\n      travel to the University two times during each follow-up period.  One follow-up period will\n      occur immediately following treatment, and the other will occur approximately 6 months\n      following treatment. During each follow-up period, the first visits will involve being\n      connected to the machine that monitors their sleep.  Participants will then return home with\n      the machine to sleep in their own beds.  The second of these visits will occur the following\n      day and will involve the return of the machine,  completion of questionnaires, and\n      measurement of participants' responses to a range of temperatures applied to their arm."
