  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/IIa  study evaluating the safety and feasibility of [89Zr]Df-IAB2M as an
      immunoPET tracer for metastatic prostate cancer. Individuals participating in this study
      will have a FDG PET scan, as well as four (4) PET scans (over a 3 day period) following the
      injection of [89Zr]Df-IAB2M PET tracer. Three different dosing levels will be explored. The
      purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety of [89Zr]Df-IAB2M, ability to detect
      prostate cancer, and optimal time point and dose level for imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IAB2M is an approximately 80 kDA molecular weight antibody fragment (a &quot;Minibody&quot;). Limited
      (Phase 0/Proof-of-concept) patient experience with this biologic targeting agent has been
      previously obtained with SPECT imaging Ex-US, demonstrating targeting of soft tissue and
      bone lesions in advanced metastatic prostate cancer.
