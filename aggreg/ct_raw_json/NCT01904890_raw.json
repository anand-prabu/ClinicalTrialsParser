The\n      investigators will recruit LHWs to be randomly assigned to the intervention arm and to the\n      comparison arm. The LHWs will each recruit 15 participants from their social network.\n      Intervention LHWs will be taught to teach their participants about CRC screening through 2\n      outreach sessions and 2 telephone calls aimed at increasing their CRC screening receipt.\n      LHWs and participants in the comparison group will receive a bilingual CRC brochure as well\n      as 2 lectures on healthy nutrition for cardiovascular health delivered by a health educator\n      and an optional post- intervention LHW outreach session on CRC screening. Effectiveness of\n      the intervention will be measured by pre-intervention and post-intervention surveys of\n      community participants' CRC screening behaviors. The investigators will also conduct\n      ethnographic observations of LHWs and their participants during the small group sessions and\n      post- intervention focus groups to understand how such a health education approach may work."
