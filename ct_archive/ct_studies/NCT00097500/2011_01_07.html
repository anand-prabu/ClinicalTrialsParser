<th>Primary outcome</th><td>Measure: Beta-cell Function After 52 Weeks of Therapy<br>Time Frame: Baseline (week -2) and 52 weeks<br>Safety Issue? No<br>Description: <p>Treatment effect on beta-cell function as measured by the ratio of Week 52 arginine-stimulated insulin secretion during a hyperglycemic clamp(specifically, the incremental AUC of insulin with respect to basal value over a 10 min period [i.e., clamp time 290 min to 300 min]) to that at baseline (i.e., the ratio is calculated as arginine-stimulated insulin secretion at week 52 divided by arginine-stimulated insulin secretion at baseline [week -2]).</p>

<th>Secondary outcome</th><td>Measure: Change in First Phase C-peptide Release<br>Time Frame: baseline (week -2), 52 weeks, and 56 weeks<br>Safety Issue?
