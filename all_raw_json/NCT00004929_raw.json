II. Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in this\n      patient population. III. Determine the effect of glycosylated MUC-2 antigen with KLH\n      conjugate on the T cell response against MUC-2 and by skin testing in these patients. IV.\n      Assess the post immunization changes in prostate specific antigen levels and other objective\n      parameters of disease including radionuclide bone scan and/or measurable disease in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive vaccination with glycosylated MUC-2 antigen with keyhole limpet\n      hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ on weeks 1-3,\n      7, 15, and 27 for a total of 6 vaccinations.
