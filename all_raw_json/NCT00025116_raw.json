Patients are stratified according to\n      measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral, low-dose ZD 1839 twice daily on day 1 and once daily on\n           days 2-28 during course 1 and then once daily on days 1-28 during subsequent courses.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral, high-dose ZD 1839 as in arm I. Treatment in both arms\n           continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of each course during study, and then at\n      4 weeks after study.\n\n      Patients with stable or responding disease are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months\n      until disease progression. All other patients are followed at 4 weeks only.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-60 patients (15-30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study."
