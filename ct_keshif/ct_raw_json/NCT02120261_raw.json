In\n      particular, we will find out about the pain level and duration before and after injection.\n      Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to receive trigger point injection that contains\n      either saline (arm one) or conventional drug mix (arm two) to treat their muscle pain. Upon\n      discharge, patients will receive instructions for regular active muscle stretching as a plan\n      to restore their muscle functions. Patients will be asked about their pain level before and\n      after treatment. In addition, patients will be followed up two weeks after treatment to find\n      out about their pain status and treatment satisfaction. Currently, there is no standard\n      protocol or studies in the emergency department for treating patients with MPS. The results\n      from this study can potentially improve pain management in the emergency department."
