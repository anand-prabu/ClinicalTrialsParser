    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect additional safety data during treatment with
      abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone among adult participants with
      asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
      who reside in areas in which abiraterone acetate is not yet available for this indication
      through local healthcare providers, and who are not eligible for enrollment into an
      available ongoing clinical study of abiraterone acetate.

      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) early access protocol
      (EAP). Approximately 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. Participants will
      receive abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily plus prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg daily.
      Treatment in 28-day cycles will continue until progression of clinical disease. Study drug
      will be provided until the company obtains market authorization and reimbursement in the
      participant countries for this indication.
