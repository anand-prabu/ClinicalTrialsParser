  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, patient sponsored study of
      Adipose-Derived Stem Cell (ASC) implantation performed intra-articularly to affected joints.

      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      diagnosed Osteoarthritis.

      ASCs will be collected from the patient's adipose-derived tissue (body fat). Using local
      anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The
      adipose tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of the adipose tissue
      derived stem cells.  In addition, peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of
      platelet rich plasma, which are then combined with the ASC's for intra-articular
      administration of affected joint.

             symptomatology

          -  Up to date on all age and gender appropriate cancer screening per American Cancer
             Society (Refer to section 9.3 for more details).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             or enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound results of this study.

          -  Active infectious disease. Patients known to have tested positive for HIV, HTLV, HBV,
             HCV, CMV (IgM &gt; IgG) and/or syphilis will have an expert consultation as to patient
             eligibility based on the patient's infectious status

          -  Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy

          -  Systolic blood pressure (supine) â‰¤90 mmHg or greater than 180mmHg

          -  Resting heart rate &gt; 100 bpm;

          -  Known drug or alcohol dependence or any other factors which will interfere with the
             study conduct or interpretation of the results or who in the opinion of the
             investigator are not suitable to participate.

             the last five years.

          -  Active clinical infection

          -  Unwilling and/or not able to give written informed consent.
