  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the inSCALE project is to test the effect of innovative approaches to increase
      coverage of integrated community case management, which provides community based-care for
      diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria, resulting in more children receiving timely and
      appropriate care for these three most common childhood illnesses

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Innovations at Scale for Community Access and Lasting Effects (inSCALE) project is
      identifying and documenting limitations to national scale up of Integrated Community Case
      Management (ICCM) and aims to demonstrate that coverage and impact of government-led ICCM
      programmes can be extended if innovative solutions can be found for critical limitations.
      Based on research, three main constraints have been found to limit coverage of community
      based management of childhood diseases: supervision, motivation and information flow.

      Potential solutions to the identified constraints have been formulated based on current
      knowledge and experiences from Malaria Consortium ICCM implementation and other relevant
      community-based initiatives in both project countries and elsewhere. Extensive formative
      research was conducted to support the design of innovations aimed to improve motivation and
      performance of community health workers.

      Innovations which have potential to address the project's aims but lack sufficient evidence
      of impact are being formally evaluated in a randomised control trial. In Mozambique, a
      technology based intervention is being tested where community health workers (CHWs) are
      provided with smart phones to programmed with a tool for decision support, immediate
      feedback and multimedia audio and images to improve adherence to protocols. The tool will
      also allow CHWs to send key indicators to a server and to keep a register of patients who
      can be tracked over time. The indicators submitted will be used for performance monitoring
      of the CHWs by providing automated timely, digestible reports with targeted follow-up
      actions for CHW supervisors. In Uganda, one technology and one community based intervention
      are being evaluated over a 12 month period. In the technology intervention, CHWs are given a
      Java enabled mobile phone through which they can send their weekly reports and drug stocks,
      receive immediate feedback based on data submission and monthly motivational messages. The
      phones in both countries also contain innovative tools such as a respiratory timers to
      support the CHWs in their work. CHWs and their supervisors are on closed user groups in
      order to increase communication and support. The community intervention is focused on the
      running of Village Health Clubs. These are designed to be highly participatory with the CHWs
      in the role of facilitator, aimed at increasing awareness about the CHW role and improving
      motivation through the support of the community.

      Continuous Ministry of Health support for health facilities to provide referral care and
      equip community health workers with medicines, tools, supervision and training are critical
      for the success of the project

    <description>The inSCALE technology supported approach will support the CHWs in providing quality case management for the under-fives who suffer from diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria through unlimited communication with their health facility supervisors and colleagues through closed-user-groups. It will enhance timely reporting of patient data and targeted support supervision on the CHWs who need support from their supervisors. With the CHWs receiving the above support and feedback messages, this will potentially increase CHW motivation, performance and retention. Data reported by CHWs can be used by the district planners to forecasting of medicine procurements and react to drug stock-outs or unusual data trends (e.g. disease outbreaks).</description>

    <description>The village health clubs aim to improve child health through a community led forum with the CHW as the main focus point. Village health club meetings will provide a forum where CHWs and community members who are part of the club can work together to identify child health and CHW challenges. They will use village networks, knowledge, creativity and other assets</description>

    <description>CHWs will be provided with mobile phones and solar chargers to carry out the following:
Activity 1: Establish closed user groups (CUGs) to enable two-way communication between CHWs and their supervisors free of charge to the users.
Activity 2:
Data submission by CHWs through mobile phones and motivational performance related feedback provided in response.
Automated messages to supervisors
i. flagging any problems and strengths/successes identified in CHWs data submitted using provided phones, ii. Alerting supervisors as to which CHWs require targeted supervision. c. CHWs submitted data summarised in a user friendly format and made accessible to district statisticians for analysis and feedback to supervisors on problems and strengths/successes identified.
Activity 3: Monthly motivational SMS messages provided to CHWs that are locally relevant to CHW work and that are designed to impact positively on CHW performance.</description>

    <intervention_name>Village Health Clubs</intervention_name>
    <description>CHWs will facilitate the clubs using a learning, planning and action cycle. Health club members will rank child health challenges faced by their community using picture cards and decide which one to focus on for each of the cycles. They will discuss solutions, which include supporting CHWs services, and take actions to meet these challenges. They will also promote group decision-making and ownership and through this process gain tangible results. Solutions to village health challenges developed by village members are a key focus of the village health club approach. Village Health Clubs are based on 5 guiding principles which will inspire community members to pull together and act, and encourage members and community leaders to use the clubs for the purpose they are intended: clubs are open to all, village owned, intended to support CHW work, strength based, and fun and focused.</description>
