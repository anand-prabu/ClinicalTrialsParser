In\n      this test, a person sits on a mat, with the soles of both feet maintaining contact with a\n      box. The top of the box has an indicator marked in centimeters that is used to measure\n      flexibility by how far the person can push the indicator without bending the legs. The knees\n      of the seated person are extended while the hips are flexed. The subject is then asked to\n      take a deep breath, and during exhalation, flex the trunk forward with the upper limbs\n      extended.\n\n      The upper limbs are supported by a bench of 23 cm long aligned with a tape measure over the\n      bench. During flexion of the trunk, the right hand is placed over the left and the tips of\n      the fingers touch the indicator on top, and move it forward as far as possible."
