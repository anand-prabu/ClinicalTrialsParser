            "textblock": "Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is a chronic disease that affects approximately 10% of all diabetes\n      patients in the world. Diabetes a serious disease in which life expectancy is reduced,\n      largely due to increased mortality from kidney disease and cardiovascular (CVD) disease.\n      Poor glycemic control also results in eye and nerve damage, and psychosocial stress. Good\n      metabolic control, e.g. normalized hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) and normal blood lipids,\n      reduces the risk of eye, kidney, nerve, and vascular damage. Proper nutrition can normalize\n      blood sugar levels, improve blood lipids and prolong life in people with diabetes, according\n      to Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU).\n\n      Dietary treatment is therefore seen as pivotal in the treatment of diabetes. This project\n      aims to evaluate two methods of structured training in patients with type 1 diabetes:\n\n        1. A structured education in carbohydrate counting, a course inspired by the DAFNE program\n           (Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating)\n\n        2. A new, structured education for heart healthy food choices and low glycemic index in\n           type 1 diabetes. The education is called \"My Wellness-LADDER\" (Lifelong Adult Diet &\n           Diabetes Education Resource) and it is specifically designed to provide high long-term\n           adherence through improved empowerment and transformative life style change.\n\n      The methods are compared with regular routine (control group).\n\n      This is a randomized controlled trial with three intervention groups 1) Healthy food choices\n      with a low glycemic index, 2) carbohydrate counting, and 3) regular routine. Follow\u2010up\n      period is 1 year. Eight Swedish specialist clinics are participating and 24 patients at each\n      clinic are to be enrolled.\n\n      The hypotheses is that structured group education on heart healthy food choices and low\n      glycemic index provide the same improvement in glycemic control and quality of life as\n      advanced carbohydrate counting in T1DM, as compared to regular routine. An additional\n      hypotheses is that structured education on healthy food choices and low glycemic index leads\n      to larger CVD risk factor reductions in T1DM compared to carbohydrate counting and regular\n      routine and that structured education on healthy food choices and low glycemic index lead to\n      more heart healthy food choices in T1DM compared to carbohydrate counting and regular\n      routine. Lastly, the hypotheses is that structured education on healthy food choices and low\n      glycemic index lead is more cost effective in T1DM compared to carbohydrate counting and\n      regular routine."
