Peregrine System Infusion Catheter is a catheter-based device\n      which is intended to be used to ablate the afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves serving\n      the kidneys.  The catheter is typically inserted via the femoral artery, steered into the\n      renal artery, and then delivers, by injection from its distal end, a neurolytic agent.  This\n      targets the nerve bundles, which are in the adventitia - a sheath surrounding the artery.\n      The aim is to reduce blood pressure in cases of resistant hypertension - seriously elevated\n      blood pressure which does not respond to drug treatment."

            "textblock": "There is strong evidence in the published literature that the renal nerves are important\n      contributors to hypertension, and that their ablation does not have adverse side-effects.\n      The literature provides technical, clinical and scientific evidence supporting the use of\n      perivascular renal denervation for a carefully defined patient group.\n\n      An existing device (the Ardian Symplicity catheter) has been shown to be safe and effective\n      for achieving perivascular renal denervation by delivery of radiofrequency energy.\n      Perivascular renal denervation by radio-frequency energy delivery is an effective therapy,\n      associated with very low risks.  In other contexts, denervation can also be safely and\n      effectively achieved by neurolytic agents.\n\n      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and performance of renal denervation\n      by a chemical neurolytic agent delivered into the advential/ periadventitial area of the\n      renal arteries for the purpose of neurolysis, using the Peregrine System Infusion Catheter,\n      in patients with refractory hypertension.\n\n      The ASI Peregrine System Infusion Catheter is similar enough to the Ardian Symplicity\n      catheter to enable the use of published data to establish the validity of the design concept\n      of the Peregrine System and estimate the likely levels of risk from side effects.  It can be\n      concluded from the literature that the ASI Peregrine System will achieve percutaneous renal\n      denervation with a low risk of procedural complications (comparable to accepted percutaneous\n      interventional therapies) and without long-term impairment of renal artery or kidney\n      function or other serious adverse events.\n\n      Chemical denervation is an appropriate treatment for the specified study population of\n      adults who have resistant hypertension despite taking at least 3 anti-hypertensive drugs of\n      different classes including at least one diuretic.  In order for the study to be valid, only\n      one chemical neurolytic agent can be used.  The Coordinating Investigator has chosen to use\n      dehydrated alcohol (not less than 98% by volume) for therapeutic neurolysis, therefore all\n      participating sites will use this agent.  This clinical investigation is intended to provide\n      clinical data that demonstrates the safety and performance of the ASI Peregrine System\n      Infusion Catheter."
