  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label dose escalation phase I trial, 1280.15, is with the first administration of
      BI 836845 in Japanese patients with various types of advanced solid tumours. The rationale
      behind this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836845 in Japanese
      patients with advanced solid tumours as weekly intravenous administration.

             to complete the study, or interfere with interpretation of study results considered
             by the investigator to be incompatible with the study treatment

          4. History of thrombosis (except tumour invading great vessels) within 1 year before
             start of study treatment or if concurrent anticoagulation required
