The patients are operated with phonomicrosurgical dissection of the\n      scarred vocal folds, removal or scar tissue and injection of autologous mesenchymal stem\n      cells, aMSC (which were previously harvested from each patients\u00b4s bone marrow, purified,\n      expanded and characterized according to standard procedure at the Center of Hematology and\n      Regenerative Medicine Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge). 5 Patients will be treated\n      with a single injection of aMSC and 3 patients with injection of aMSC mixed with a carrier\n      hyaluronan gel developed at Uppsala University Sweden and at the Karolinska Institute. The\n      laryngeal status, vocal fold function, and voice function will be followed individually with\n      an advanced battery of examinations performed before and up to 1 year postoperatively. Blood\n      samples for e.g. inflammatory parameters, will be obtained before and up to 24-48 hours\n      postoperatively"
