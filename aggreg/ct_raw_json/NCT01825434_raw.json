The\n      present study therefore aims to investigate the combination of polydextrose (Litesse\u00ae), L.\n      acidophilus NCFM\u00ae and B. lactis HN019 in a yogurt on intestinal transit in subjects who\n      suffer from constipation.\n\n      Methods: Patients with constipation were randomly divided into two groups, Placebo Group\n      (PG) and Treatment Group (TG), and had to eat 180 ml of unflavored yogurt every morning for\n      14 days. Those in the CG received only yogurt, while the TG received yogurt containing\n      polydextrose, L. acidophilus NCFM\u00ae (ATCC 700396) and B. lactis HN019 (AGAL NM97/09513).\n      Expect that patients who took a combination of polydextrose has a decrease in the colonic\n      transit time (CTT) when comparing initial and final transit time."
