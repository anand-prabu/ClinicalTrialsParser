Circumference\n      measurement using a measuring tape is an inexpensive simple method and therefore useful and\n      widespread in clinical practice. Circumference measurement performance varies amongst\n      therapists and lacks uniformity in the literature. To date, the effect of different limb\n      positions on measurement results has not been examined.\n\n      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe 1) the effect of position on upper limb\n      volume measurement by using circumference measurement and 2) to examine whether the\n      difference between positions are similar in the upper limbs of the same woman, and 3)\n      between groups of women who are in the intensive phase, in the maintenance phase of\n      lymphedema treatment  and women without lymphedema"
