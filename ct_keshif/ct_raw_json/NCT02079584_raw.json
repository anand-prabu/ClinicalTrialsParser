We hypothesize that patients will have a relatively\n      low rate of adverse events and higher adherence than has been reported historically for\n      warfarin treatment. Patients will be scheduled for follow up care with one of Dr. Kline's\n      Outpatient Thrombosis clinics at Methodist Hospital or Wishard Health Services after\n      diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We will\n      collect information for a registry and a database will be developed and blood specimens will\n      be obtained at each follow up visit for analysis and storage for possible use related to\n      this treatment and research or study at a later date. Questionnaires will be administered to\n      collect variables that we hypothesize to be important to understand the causes of\n      non-adherence. To better quantify the economic impact, we will also perform a cost\n      effectiveness analysis with no comparator, meaning we will tabulate the cost of care for\n      each patient enrolled using variable costs from a UB92 report for each patient."
