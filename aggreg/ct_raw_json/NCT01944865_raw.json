The aim of this study was to compare the effects of INTV\n      and INTM on aerobic fitness variables (peak power output, Wmax, lactate threshold, and onset\n      of blood lactate accumulation) but more importantly on performance as measured using a\n      controlled mountain bike race, i.e. simulation. The investigators hypothesized that INTV and\n      INTM training were equally effective in improving Wmax, Lactate threshold and onset of blood\n      lactate accumulation, but INTV was superior in enhancing performance in mountai bike race\n      simulation.This hypothesis is due to studies that have shown higher gains in performance\n      with long duration of aerobic high intensity interval training in comparison to the shorter\n      training at a higher intensity."

Pre to post differences were examined using two-way ANOVA, with a factor time on two levels (pre, post), and a factor group on two levels (INTV and INTM). Differences between groups post-training were also analyzed with ANCOVA using the pre-training values as covariate. These differences were calculated after log transforming the dependent variables. The difference between groups in the primary outcome (performance) was also analyzed using a magnitude-based inferences approach. The smallest worthwhile difference for the performance was considered to be 1%.",
