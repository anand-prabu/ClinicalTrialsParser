    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) between
      JNJ-56021927 and abiraterone acetate, determine safety of the combination and evaluate in a
      descriptive manner the efficacy in participants with Metastatic Castration-Resistant
      Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). The study will also, potentially provide dosing recommendations for
      abiraterone acetate in future studies when combined with JNJ-56021927.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (participants will know the identity of study drug
      received) study in participants with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
      (mCRPC). The study will be a single sequence design (ie, all participants will take
      abiraterone acetate + prednisone [AAP] once daily on Days 1-7 of Treatment Cycle 1 and then
      proceed with combined daily intake of AAP+JNJ-56021927 from Treatment Cycle 1, Day 8 through
      to the end of treatment (ie, for up to an expected duration of approximately 18 months).
      The study will consist of a 28-day screening phase to determine eligibility, an open-label
      treatment phase consisting of 28-day treatment cycles, and a 30-day follow-up phase for
      collection of adverse events (AE) after last dose of study drug. Participants will have
      blood samples collected during the study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor
      activity (PSA). Participant safety will also be monitored by the collection of adverse
      events. Imaging assessments for disease evaluation will be planned at discretion of the
      Investigator.  Once all participants have completed study treatment up to Cycle 3 Day 1, a
      data cutoff is planned to evaluate the short term safety profile of the combination and to
      complete the PK analysis up to the cutoff date. All participants will continue on study (ie,
      to receive treatment) until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up,
      or the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. The end of the study is defined when all
      participants have completed treatment.
