However, all\n      guidelines stress the need for screening decision making with a provider. This study\n      evaluated the effectiveness of a brochure designed for the female partners of AA men,\n      designed to help promote such discussion on the part of their mates. We also explored the\n      effect of the partner's monitoring style (i.e., the extent to which the partner typically\n      attends to health threats) on promoting discussion.\n\n      Methods: Female partners of AA men (N=231) were randomized to receive either a Pca screening\n      CDC brochure for AA men, combined with a \"partner\" brochure containing strategies to promote\n      men's initiation of a provider visit to discuss screening, or the CDC brochure only, and\n      completed pre- and post-intervention surveys online.\n\n      Conclusions: High monitoring partners may be effective in influencing their AA mates to\n      initiate provider discussion, particularly when tailored messaging is provided."
