  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of paclitaxel combined with phosphoinositide
      3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor BKM120 in patients with stage II or III breast cancer that is
      described as estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative and
      endocrine therapy resistant.  Drugs such as paclitaxel stop the growth of tumors by blocking
      cancer cell division. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 inhibits some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth and may improve the response of endocrine resistant tumors to treatment. Giving
      paclitaxel and PI3K inhibitor BKM120 before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

             pulmonary infiltrates.

          -  Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical conditions (e.g.,
             active or uncontrolled infection) that could cause unacceptable safety risks or

          -  Currently receiving treatment with medication which carries a known risk of
             prolonging QT interval or inducing Torsades de Pointes.  If treatment with this drug
             can be discontinued and the patient can be switched to a different medication prior
             to starting study drug, this is acceptable.

          -  Receiving chronic treatment with steroid or another immunosuppressive agent.  Note
             that topical applications, inhaled sprays, eye drops, or local injections are
             allowed.

          -  Consumption of known CYP3A inhibitors such as Seville oranges, grapefruit, pummelos,
             exotic citrus fruits, St. John's wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba),
             dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng.

          -  Currently receiving treatment with medication known to be a moderate or strong
             inhibitor or inducer of isoenzyme CYP3A.  If treatment with this drug can be
             discontinued and the patient can be switched to a different medication prior to
             starting study drug, this is acceptable.  Please note that concomitant treatment with
             a weak inhibitor of CYP3A is allowed.

          -  Currently taking therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium or any other
             Coumadin-derivative anticoagulant.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.  Patient must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours of starting treatment.

          -  Known HIV-positivity.

          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities

          -  Because breast cancer occurs predominantly in women, men will not be eligible for
             this trial.  Women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial.
