      The purpose of the study is to compare the performance of two currently available influenza
      (flu) vaccines. This study will try and determine if the high dose flu vaccine provides
      protection that is the same or better than that of regular dose flu vaccine. Both the
      regular dose and the high dose flu vaccines are approved by the FDA for use in older adults.

    <textblock>
      Influenza and pneumonia are the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, the
      leading cause of vaccine preventable death, and the leading cause of infection related
      deaths among nursing home residents(Nace, Drinka et al.2010). Each year, an estimated 36,000
      individuals die from seasonal influenza and over 90% of these deaths occur among older
      adults, primarily the frail older adults residing in LTC settings(Fiore,Uyeki et al.
      2010).Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing influenza (Nichol and Treanor
      2006). Despite increasing success in immunizing LTC residents though, outbreaks continue to
      occur annually with case fatality rates ranging between 5-55% (Nace 2008). Older adults have
      a reduced response to influenza vaccination, in part due to age related immunosenescence
      (Keitel, Atmar et al. 1121; Skowronski, Tweed et al. 2008). It is widely recognized that
      more effective vaccine options are needed for frail older adults. One option is to increase
      the hemagglutinin (HA) dose in influenza vaccines in an effort to increase antibodies to
      hemagglutinin. To date, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the HDIV among LTC
      residents.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the noninferiority of high- dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HDIV) versus standard dose inactivated influenza vaccine(SDIV)among residents of long term care(LTC)settings.Non-inferiority will be determined by comparing baseline and one month post vaccination HAI and MN titers using non-inferiority analysis.</description>
