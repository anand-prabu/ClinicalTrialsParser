Aim: To analyze\n      thoracoabdominal kinematics (TK) in individuals with HF associated to cardiomegaly after\n      using NIV. Methods: A randomized crossover clinical trial with allocation consisted of two\n      experimental phases: NIV and control, 7 days apart of each other. During NIV phase, 30\n      minutes of bi-level ventilation was performed. Any type of ventilator support was offered\n      during control phase. Optoeletronic plethismography was performed to asses TK."
