  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of carbapenems, very broad spectrum antibiotics of last resort, is becoming more
      common due to the increased prevalence in the hospital and community of extended spectrum
      β-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacilli (GNB), including CTX-M type, which are
      resistant to all other β-lactam antibiotics. Meanwhile, it creates a selective pressure
      towards emergence of strains which are also resistant to carbapenems, placing patients in a
      catastrophic situation of therapeutic dead-end. A better understanding of the mechanisms of
      emergence of BGN resistant to carbapenems is necessary to optimize their use and undertake
      preventive measures to preserve their effectiveness. The aim of the study is to evaluate and
      describe the emergence of carbapenem-induced resistant GNB in patient intestinal microflora.

      The use of carbapenems, very broad spectrum antibiotics of last resort, is becoming more
      common due to the increased prevalence in the hospital and community of extended spectrum
      β-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacilli (GNB), including CTX-M type, which are
      resistant to all other β-lactam antibiotics. Meanwhile, it creates a selective pressure
      towards emergence of strains which are also resistant to carbapenems, placing patients in a
      catastrophic situation of therapeutic dead-end. A better understanding of the mechanisms of
      emergence of BGN resistant to carbapenems is necessary to optimize their use and undertake
      preventive measures to preserve their effectiveness.

      Hypotheses: Carbapenems induce in treated patients the emergence of resistant GNB in
      intestinal flora and have an impact on colonization resistance of the gut microbiota.

      Primary objective: To determine the frequency of emergence of carbapenems resistant GNB in
      the intestinal flora at the end of a treatment by imipenem or ertapenem.

      Secondary objective(s):

        -  Assess the presence of carbapenem resistant GNB in the intestinal flora before
           treatment.

        -  Evaluate the presence and / or persistence of carbapenem resistant GNB in the
           intestinal flora on day 3 of treatment, and 15 days and 1 month after the end of
           treatment.

        -  Determine the molecular mechanisms of resistance of strains of interest.

        -  Describe the gastrointestinal tract colonization by non-commensal microorganisms before
           and after treatment (impact on colonization resistance).

        -  Describe the characteristics of patients with emergence of resistance compared to
           patients who do not.

        -  Proper conservation of stool of 10 patients for metagenomic and/or metatranscriptomic
           analysis of changes in the intestinal flora.

      Primary endpoint: Presence of carbapenem resistant GNB in the stool at the end of treatment
      in patients who did not before, after culture on selective media.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Presence of carbapenem resistant GNB in stools before treatment, at day 3 and 15 days
           and 1 month after stopping treatment, after culture on selective media.

        -  PCR and sequencing of resistance genes from strains of interest.

        -  Colonization of the digestive tract by non-commensal microorganisms before and after
           treatment.

        -  Characteristics of patients with or without emergence of resistance.
