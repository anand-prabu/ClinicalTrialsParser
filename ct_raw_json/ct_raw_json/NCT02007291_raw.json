Hence, age-related\n      disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), warrant special attention due to their high\n      prevalence in the elderly. Pharmacologic treatment of AD is based on cholinesterase\n      inhibitors (ChEI) and memantine, leading to modest clinical benefits both in the short and\n      long-term.\n\n      However, clinical response is heterogeneous and needs further investigation. Objective: To\n      investigate the rate of response to ChEI in AD after three months of treatment. Methods:\n      Patients with mild or moderate dementia due to probable AD or to AD associated with\n      cerebrovascular disease were included in the study."
