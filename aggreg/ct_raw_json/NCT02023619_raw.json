Keratoconus\n      patients referred to the Eye Dpt. of the University Hospital North Norway for CXL (Corneal\n      collagen cross-linking)- treatment and healthy subjects seeking preoperative evaluation for\n      refractive surgery at SynsLaser\u00ae Kirurgi AS Troms\u00f8 clinic are examined by corneal SD-OCT as\n      a part of their routine examination. Analysis of their SD-OCT corneal scans is used for the\n      purpose of this study.Two cross-sectional meridional corneal profiles (along steepest and\n      flattest meridians, located by a Scheimpflug-based corneal topography) for each individual\n      are obtained by using a RTVue100\u00ae (Optovue Inc. Fremont, California, USA), 26000-Hz SD-OCT\n      across the central 6mm diameter of the cornea."
