            "textblock": "Obesity increases the risk of several health conditions. Weight loss of 5-10% of initial\n      weight reduces the risk of several diseases. This degree of weight loss is achievable in\n      behavioral obesity programs. However, about 33% of initial weight loss is regained within\n      one year and very little weight loss is maintained within three to five years. Thus, new\n      strategies improving long-term weight loss maintenance are needed. One dietary strategy that\n      increases self-reported satiation and satiety is consuming a low energy density (ED) diet. A\n      low-ED diet allows a greater weight of food relative to total energy to be consumed, which\n      is the proposed mechanism for the enhanced self-reported satiation and satiety found with\n      low-ED meals.  Research has shown that when participants are served low-ED meals, while\n      total weight of food consumed does not change, meal energy intake decreases.  Importantly,\n      when low-ED meals are consumed across several days, reduced energy intake continues to\n      occur, showing no degree of energy intake compensation. To address the gaps regarding the\n      relationship between dietary ED and weight loss maintenance, we propose to conduct a\n      randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the effect of a low-ED prescription and its\n      proposed mechanisms on weight loss maintenance.  It is hypothesized that the Low-ED will\n      have less weight regain than Energy Balance at 6 months and the Low-ED will consume a lower\n      ED diet, less energy and percent energy from fat, and greater grams from solid food and\n      fiber than Energy Balance at 6 months."
