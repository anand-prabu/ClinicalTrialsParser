Giving chemotherapy, such as treosulfan and fludarabine\n      phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the\n      growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the\n      donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help\n      destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted\n      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving\n      tacrolimus before and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from\n      happening."
