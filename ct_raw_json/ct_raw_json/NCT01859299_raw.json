            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Uveitis and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are two types of eye diseases related\n      to inflammation in the eyes. However, the causes of these diseases are not fully understood.\n      Researchers want to look at bacteria in the body that might be related to the inflammation.\n      They will study the natural bacteria present in the gut and intestines of people with\n      uveitis and AMD to learn what might trigger these diseases.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study the gut and intestinal bacteria in people with AMD and uveitis.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have quiet (non-inflamed) uveitis.\n\n        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have active (inflamed) uveitis that requires\n           additional treatment.\n\n        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have uveitis or AMD and are having immune\n           system therapy at the National Eye Institute.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants with quiet uveitis will have one study visit. Participants with active\n           uveitis will have two study visits. The second visit will be 4 to 6 months after the\n           first visit. Participants with uveitis or AMD who are having immune system therapy will\n           have two visits. The first will be before the start of the therapy, and the second\n           visit will be 4 to 6 months after starting the therapy.\n\n        -  About 12 hours before each study visit, participants will give themselves an enema at\n           home. This will clear out the lower intestine for specimen collection.\n\n        -  At each visit, participants will have a full eye examination, including vision and eye\n           pressure tests. They will provide blood samples for testing. They will also have an\n           anoscopy to collect rectal fluid and study the colon lining.\n\n        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study."

            "textblock": "Objective: What precipitates ocular inflammatory episodes remains unknown but a possible\n      potentiating factor is the microbiome. The microbiome has become increasingly studied with\n      the advent of new techniques, but these have not been applied to uveitis. We wish to\n      evaluate microbiome composition in patients with the ocular inflammatory diseases uveitis\n      and agerelated macular degeneration (AMD), who may be on standard therapy or receiving\n      orally administered tolerizing antigen therapy.\n\n      Study Population: A total of 45 participants will be enrolled in this study. Of those\n      participants, the goal is to enroll 15 participants with treated, quiet uveitis, 15\n      participants with active uveitis requiring additional systemic therapy and 15 participants\n      with uveitis or AMD that are participating in an oral tolerance study at the NEI.\n      Participants must be at least 18 years old. Microbiome samples from an existing control\n      population of healthy volunteers established by Dr. Jonathan Braun of UCLA will be used as a\n      comparison for the microbiome samples obtained from the participants in this study.\n      Peripheral blood samples from an existing control population of healthy volunteers\n      established at the NEI LI will be used as a comparison for the peripheral blood samples\n      obtained from the participants in this study. No healthy volunteers will be recruited in\n      this study.\n\n      Design: This is an observational, cross-sectional, single-center study. Participants will\n      receive a complete ocular examination with clinical testing as determined clinically and\n      will undergo an anoscopy for collection of rectal fluid specimens. Participants with quiet\n      uveitis will only have one study visit; participants with active uveitis requiring\n      additional systemic therapy or participants who are participating in an oral tolerance study\n      at the NEI will have two study visits.\n\n      Outcome Measures: The outcomes will be related to the comparison of the various microbiome\n      samples to controls and between groups. In addition, comparisons will be made to these\n      findings and the immunome."
