To exploit the dependence of tumors on\n      glutamine, CB-839, a potent and selective inhibitor of the first enzyme in glutamine\n      utilization, glutaminase, will be tested in this Phase 1 study in patients with solid\n      tumors.\n\n      This study is an open-label Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 in patients with advanced solid\n      tumors.  The study will be conducted in 2 parts.  Part 1 is a dose escalation study\n      enrolling patients with locally-advanced, metastatic and/or refractory solid tumors to\n      receive CB-839 capsules orally three times daily.  In Part 2, patients with each of the\n      following diseases will be enrolled: A) Triple-Negative Breast Cancer, B) Non-Small Cell\n      Lung Cancer (adenocarcinoma), C) Renal Cell Cancer, and D) Mesothelioma.  All patients will\n      be assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration of drug), pharmacodynamics\n      (inhibition of glutaminase), biomarkers (biochemical markers that may predict responsiveness\n      in later studies), and tumor response."
