  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global prospective, observational, multi-center registry to evaluate the long-term
      safety profile for patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) who are treated with teduglutide
      in a routine clinical setting. The registry will also evaluate the long-term clinical
      outcomes in patients with SBS. SBS patients treated and not treated with teduglutide will be
      enrolled.
