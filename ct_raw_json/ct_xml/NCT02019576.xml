  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a newer type of focused radiation therapy that precisely
      and accurately delivers high dose radiation to a tumour, while sparing much of the nearby
      normal organs.  The use of stereotactic radiotherapy results in high rates of tumour
      destruction with minimal side effects which are very well tolerated.  Often stereotactic
      radiotherapy has been used to try to cure patients who have an early stage cancer which has
      not spread, but there is less experience with using it in patients with cancer which has
      spread.

      The purpose of this study is to measure how well stereotactic radiotherapy can destroy
      kidney cancer tumours which are no longer being controlled by Sunitinib and to measure how
      much longer such an approach will allow patients to stay on Sunitinib before needing to
      switch to another medication.  Stereotactic radiotherapy will be used to treat only the
      growing tumours and then patients will continue with Sunitinib.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate local control at one year of metastases treated with stereotactic radiotherapy in patients who present with oligo-progression while receiving first-line treatment with Sunitinib.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patients will have evidence of measurable metastatic kidney cancer according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.  All progressing metastases sites will be amenable to stereotactic radiotherapy.  The primary endpoint of local control will be defined as the absence of local failure in the irradiated site(s).  Progressive enlargement will be defined as a 20% enlargement observed on two consecutive scans from baseline scan.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate progression free survival after stereotactic radiotherapy while continuing to receive first-line systemic therapy with Sunitinib.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Progression free survival will be evaluated via disease assessments of radiology scans completed every three months from the time of stereotactic radiotherapy until progression is confirmed.  Progressive disease will be defined as a 20% increase in RECIST 1.1 criteria measurements observed on two consecutive scans from the baseline scan.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the acute and late toxicity to stereotactic radiotherapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Acute and late toxicities to stereotactic radiotherapy will be assessed from adverse events, vital signs and by clinically significant changes in laboratory evaluations.  Adverse events will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  These events will be followed until resolution or for a maximum of two years, which ever occurs first.</description>

    <description>Stereotactic radiotherapy will be administered for up to five areas of metastatic sites showing oligo-progression within the same time period.  During the Sunitinib break period, stereotactic radiotherapy will be delivered in a single fraction or up to a maximum of eight fractions.  The number of fractions will depend on how many sites are being irradiated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             procedures.

          3. Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 80%.

          4. Favorable or intermediate Heng prognostic group defined as having two or less of the
             following factors:  hemoglobin &lt; LLN; serum corrected calcium &gt; ULN; Karnofsky
             performance status &lt; 80%; time from initial diagnosis to initiation of therapy &lt; 1
             year; absolute neutrophil count &gt; ULN; platelet count &gt; ULN.

          5. Histologic confirmation of renal cell carcinoma with a clear cell component.

          6. Evidence of measurable metastatic kidney cancer according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

             one imaging compared to baseline that shows response or no change in all metastatic
             lesions (Note:  SD by RECIST that allows ≤ 19% increase not allowed).

          8. Radiographic evidence of ≤ 5 metastatic lesions progressing.  Of the 5 progressing
             lesions, a maximum of 3 lesions can be in soft tissue.  (Ex. If no bone metastases
             progressing:  a maximum of 3 soft tissue lesions.  If bone metastases progressing:  a
             maximum of 5 total lesions and 3 in soft tissue.)

          9. All progressing metastases are amenable to stereotactic radiotherapy.

         10. Each progression metastases fulfills one of the following criteria for
             oligo-progression:  a.  Progression of an individual metastasis according to RECIST
             1.1 criteria (≥ 20% enlargement of the tumour vs. baseline or nadir, taking as
             reference the smallest diameter seen prior to starting or during first line systemic
             therapy and associated with a 5 mm minimum increase in size); b. Unambiguous
             development of a new metastatic lesion from the time of scan taken prior to starting

          6. Other condition, illness, psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or stereotactic radiotherapy
             administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and in the
             judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
             study.
