            "textblock": "The Boston Keratoprosthesis type I (KPro) is a prosthetic cornea used to treat several\n      causes of corneal blindness. Some categories of patients, including those with auto-immune\n      diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome and mucous\n      membrane pemphigoid, have a higher risk of failure for the KPro. Because of chronic\n      inflammation, the cornea supporting the KPro may melt, leading to a higher risk of\n      infection, loss of the KPro and loss of the eye.\n\n      Infliximab is an antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha and is used intravenously to\n      control inflammation in several diseases. It has been used in some cases of corneal melting\n      with significant success.\n\n      This study's hypothesis is that infliximab can be successfully used as an eye drop (instead\n      of the usual administration through veins) and that its regular use may prevent melt in eyes\n      with a Boston Keratoprosthesis type I and underlying auto-immune disease."
