      Individuals with serious mental illness have greater morbidity from physical illness and
      mortality than the general population, but tend not to initiate or sustain engagement in
      health promotion interventions.  Although promising weight management and wellness
      interventions have been developed for this population, they are very intensive and tend to
      have low enrollment, high attrition, and low reach.  This pilot study will investigate a
      novel low-demand intervention that may be initially more acceptable, the Get Moving and Get
      Well! (GMGW) program.  The primary objectives of the proposed study are to investigate the
      effects of participation in the GMGW program on measures of behavioral activation,
      self-efficacy, physical activity, general physical and mental health, mood, participants'
      intent to engage in more intensive physical health interventions, and actual engagement in
      those programs.  Results of this pilot study will inform a future full-scale study of GMGW.

      Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI)
      have greater physical illness morbidity and mortality than the general population, but
      typically do not enroll in nor complete health promotion interventions.  This pilot study
      will provide preliminary evaluation of a low-demand physical activity intervention that may
      be acceptable to Veterans with SMI and lead to improved health in this medically vulnerable
      population.

      Project Background: The relatively high rates of morbidity and mortality found among
      individuals with SMI have led to prioritization by Mental Health QUERI, and other groups, of
      prevention and health promotion in addition to improved coordination of physical health care
      for this population.  Although promising health promotion interventions have been developed,
      they are intensive and none seem to successfully address the challenge of improving reach
      and enrollment while minimizing attrition.  We propose to conduct a pilot evaluation of a
      novel low-demand intervention that may be an acceptable introduction to health promotion,
      the Get Moving and Get Well! (GMGW) program.  Participants in the current version of GMGW
      have described benefits beyond those expected.  We believe a 12-week GMGW program may be an
      effective and relatively low-demand intervention to promote self-efficacy and physical
      health in Veterans with SMI through increasing Veteran behavioral activation.

      Project Objectives: The objectives of the proposed study are to: (a) determine the effects
      of participation in the 12-week GMGW program on a measure of behavioral activation; (b)
      determine the effects of GMGW on measures of self-efficacy, physical activity, general
      physical and mental health, and mood; and (c) determine the effects of participation in the
      class on measures of intent to engage and actual engagement in more intensive physical
      health programs.

      Project Methods: In order to inform a future full scale study, we will complete the
      development of a 12-week manualized GMGW class, assess its acceptability, feasibility and
      time burden, and evaluate effects of the intervention on key outcome measures.  To achieve
      the aims of the study, we will randomly assign 30 participants to either GMGW or an
      attention control condition.  Participants will complete baseline measures investigating
      behavioral activation, self-efficacy, physical activity, physical and emotional health,
      mood, and intent to engage in health promotion activities before beginning the class.  These
      measures will be repeated at the end of the 12-week class, along with questions
      investigating the acceptability of the interventions.  A chart review will investigate
      actual engagement in health promotion interventions.  We will be looking for the emergence
      of trends for differences in expected directions and response patterns within and between
      groups that will inform us about effect sizes for the measures and permit a power analysis
      for the full scale trial.  We plan to use repeated measures analysis of variance,
      controlling for any variables that differ significantly between the intervention and control
      groups, to test the hypothesis that GMGW participants will have greater improvements on the
      measures at the end of the 12-week intervention than the control participants.  Finally, we
      will also compare the number of participants who have evidence of participation in new
      health promotion activities in their medical record using a chi-square test of equal
      proportions.
