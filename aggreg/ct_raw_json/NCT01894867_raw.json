Chronic low magnesium state has\n      been associated with a number of chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, coronary\n      heart disease, and osteoporosis.\n\n      There are not enough studies on magnesium status in chronic cirrhotics who may be in\n      depletion. However , several studies have shown in patients magnesium deficiency with liver\n      cirrhosis.  Patients with liver cirrhosis showed considerably reduced muscle strength and\n      muscle Mg . Magnesium may have a role in the neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric\n      manifestations of chronic liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy and muscle cramps).\n\n      The use of magnesium as a therapeutic agent in asthma, myocardial infarction, and\n      pre-eclampsia is also discussed. We suggest addition of magnesium to patients with\n      established cirrhosis in order to reduce the neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric\n      manifestations of chronic liver disease."
