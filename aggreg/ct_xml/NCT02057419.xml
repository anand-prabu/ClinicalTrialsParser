    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to answer the following questions: (a) how do sexual and
      reproductive health (SRH) delivery method characteristics play a role in user preference for
      specific SRH methods; (b) can we understand the interplay between salient SRH product
      characteristics and effective use; (c) does effective use differ by indication (e.g.,
      whether the product is for contraception or lubrication); and (d) can this knowledge help
      product developers better understand how to design new SRH products and develop behavioral
      (or point-of-care) interventions to optimize use?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is a global public health priority.
      Providing efficacious SRH technologies that have the greatest likelihood of use will have
      the greatest impact on women's health. Critical to use is &quot;acceptability.&quot; However, current
      conceptualizations of adherence and acceptability fail to fully articulate and account for
      patterns of use and non-use. This research hypothesizes that a new model of use, Effective
      Use, is required. If correct, and if developers utilize an Effective Use model, a shift from
      the current &quot;acceptability = adherence&quot; paradigm would offer new insights in the development
      of SRH technologies that will result in increased use and improved SRH outcomes. If the
      model can be fully realized, women will have the best reproductive health technologies
      science can provide. The impact on global public health would be far-reaching, affecting
      reproductive health in women and men: decreasing STI incidence, minimizing unplanned
      pregnancies, and decreasing morbidity and mortality due to a range of other reproductive
      health conditions.

      Conditions: There will be 2 experimental conditions: sexual lubricant use and contraceptive
      use. Each participant will use 3 different SRH products for 3 months each. The sexual
      lubricant use condition will include gel, film, and capsule. The contraceptive use condition
      will include gel, intravaginal ring, and oral contraceptive pill. The order in which
      participants experience each delivery method will be randomized.

      Methodology and Data Collection: Volunteers (N~20-30) will first be screened for the study
      using a brief questionnaire.  Those who are interested in contraception and are eligible
      based on their responses to the prescreen will then complete a clinical screening visit
      (contraceptive arm only) and pregnancy test. Those who are interested in lubricants and are
      eligible based on their responses to the prescreen, and those who are eligible after
      clinical screening (contraception arm), will complete a survey that asks questions about
      demographics and sexual and reproductive history.

      During the course of the study, participants will evaluate three study products
      (contraceptives OR sexual lubricants). Each product will be used for three consecutive
      months. Participants will be randomly assigned to the order in which they will try the three
      products. They will be given (lubricants), or prescribed (contraceptives) a three month
      supply of the product at the beginning of each use period. Participants will be required to
      complete a brief phone survey (&lt;5 minutes) every day, beginning the day after they start
      their first product evaluation period and continuing until they complete their final study
      visit (approximately 9 months). The phone survey includes a short set of questions about
      sexual behavior and product use during the time since the last phone survey (about 24
      hours). About once a month, each participant will be required to complete a web survey about
      their experience with the study product.

      Every three months, participants will meet with research staff and, if necessary, the study
      clinician. All participants will be tested for pregnancy, and will be given, or prescribed,
      the next study product. Participants will also complete an individual in-depth interview
      with study staff about their experiences in the study. Participants will repeat these steps
      for the final (third) study product. After a participant has tried all three products, she
      will meet with a clinician (contraceptive arm only) to follow up clinically about her
      contraception options post-study participation. All participants complete a final survey
      that will ask about their experiences with all three study products, and about what kinds of
      products, if any, they might be interested in using in the future.  Participants will also
      complete a final in-depth interview.
