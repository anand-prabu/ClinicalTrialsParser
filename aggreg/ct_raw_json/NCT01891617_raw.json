The action of gut peptides, particularly GLP-1, on gastric\n      emptying is likely to be important in mediating its effects on postprandial appetite and\n      glycemia (Nauck et al. 1997). Our hypothesis is that exercise amplifies gut peptide\n      secretion when diet is enriched with fat, and that this stimulus suppresses the hunger\n      sensation."
