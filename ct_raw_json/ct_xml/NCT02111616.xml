    <textblock>
      Purpose: Cancer survivorship is a high clinical and research priority both nationally and at
      the University of North Carolina. The investigators propose a randomized pilot study testing
      the development, implementation and evaluation of a parallel patient and streamlined
      provider version of a personalized Survivorship Care Plan (SCP) with lung cancer patients.

      Participants: 60 lung cancer patients at Rex Cancer Center.

      Procedures (methods): Participants will be recruited and randomized to the standard of care
      (30 patients) or intervention (30 patients) arm. Patients randomized to standard of care
      will receive a tailored survivorship care plan at the end of cancer treatment. Patients
      randomized to the intervention will receive a care plan and coordinating visit with their
      primary care provider. Patients will be invited to complete baseline and follow-up
      assessments regarding care needs and confidence in post cancer care.

      All patient primary care providers will receive condensed provider versions of the care
      plan. Providers will be asked to evaluate how the SCP and coordinated care visit
      (intervention only) facilitated communication and coordination of care.

    <description>To compare the change in confidence about survivorship care between patients who receive a coordinated care visit with their PCP (intervention group) compared to those who do not have this visit (control group). The project will use 8 questionnaires to assess changes in patient and provider confidence and patient concerns over the course of the study. The primary objective in this one year study is to compare changes in CSI scores among patients receiving the proposed standard of care survivorship care plan (30 patients) to patients receiving care plans and a coordinated PCP visit (30 patients) to determine whether the delivery of tailored SCPs increases the confidence of survivors in receiving post treatment cancer care.</description>

    <description>To compare the change in confidence about survivorship care between PCPs who were 1) only assigned survivors in the control group, 2) only assigned survivor in the coordinated care visit and 3) who were assigned both types of survivors. This information will be captured via questionnaires.</description>
