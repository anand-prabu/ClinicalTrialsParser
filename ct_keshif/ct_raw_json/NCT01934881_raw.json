All patients will be evaluated using the Movement Disorder\n      Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part\n      III at baseline (one week before surgery) and at 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively.\n\n      Stimulation parameters setting: The first programming is performed at 3-4 weeks after\n      surgery. Bilateral contacts are as cathode for monopolar configuration. The initial voltage,\n      pulse width and frequency are bilaterally 1.0-1.5 V, 60 \u03bcs and 130 Hz for each individual,\n      respectively. Voltage is gradually increased to a stable level first, until the optimal\n      efficacy is achieved. Two weeks later, when patients came back to hospital for\n      reprogramming, the voltage is also first adjusted to optimize the stimulation parameters.\n      Either pulse width or frequency will be adjusted when increasing voltage more than 0.4 V for\n      one time still can not get satisfactory outcomes. The frequency is adjusted when bilateral\n      symptoms are unresponsive to voltage. Frequency is increased by 15-20 Hz for each time.\n      Pulse width is then adjusted for the satisfactory clinical response of unilateral symptoms\n      which are not satisfied after increasing voltage or frequency. Pulse width is increased to\n      90 \u03bcs if necessary (e.g. severe tremor).\n\n      Groups: Patients are divided into two groups according to the parameter settings during\n      follow-up. Group I: patients with voltage adjustment only. The pulse width is kept to 60 \u03bcs\n      and frequency to 130 Hz constant throughout the follow-up period. Group II: patients with\n      adjustment of more than two stimulation parameters (voltage, pulse width or frequency)\n      during the follow-up."
