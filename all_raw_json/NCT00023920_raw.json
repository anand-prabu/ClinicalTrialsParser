Monoclonal\n      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the\n      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or\n      deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as idarubicin\n      and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop\n      growing or die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may be an effective\n      treatment for blast phase chronic myelogenous leukemia"
