  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gabapentin enacarbil (GEn; GSK1838262; HORIZANT), at a dose of 600 mg/day, is currently
      approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe primary
      Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy,
      tolerability, and safety of GEn at lower doses (450 and 300 mg/day) as well as the already
      approved dose of 600 mg/day versus placebo for the treatment of subjects with moderate to
      severe primary RLS. This study is being conducted as a post-marketing commitment (PMC) as a
      condition of the approval of HORIZANT tablets (NDA 022399).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel group
      study to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of 3 doses of GEn (600, 450, and 300
      mg/day) compared with placebo in the treatment of subjects with moderate-to-severe primary
      RLS.

      The study will include 9 visits over approximately 14 weeks for eligible subjects including
      a 1-week Screening Period, a 12-week Treatment Period, and a 1 week Follow up Period.
      Screening will occur within 1 week of the first scheduled dose of study medication. The
      total duration of the study, from the first subject enrolled to the last subject completed
      will be approximately 2 years.

      Eligible subjects (at least 18 years of age) must have:

        -  a diagnosis of RLS according to the IRLSSG Diagnostic Criteria

        -  a history of RLS symptoms for at least 15 nights in the prior month or, if on
           treatment, this frequency of symptoms before treatment was started

        -  documented RLS symptoms for at least 4 of the 7 consecutive evenings/nights during the
           Screening Period, and a total RLS severity score of at least 15 on the International
           Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale at the screening and baseline visits

      Approximately 498 subjects will be enrolled, randomly assigned to treatment groups, and
      receive study medication once daily for 12 weeks. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive 1 of the 4 following treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1:1:1:

        -  GEn 600 mg/day

        -  GEn 450 mg/day

        -  GEn 300 mg/day

        -  Matching placebo Subjects will be instructed to take their study medication once daily
           with food in the evening at approximately 5 PM. Each tablet must be swallowed whole and
           not divided, crushed, or chewed.

      Each subject, regardless of treatment assignment, will take 3 tablets of study medication (1
      tablet from Bottle A, 1 tablet from Bottle B, and 1 tablet from Bottle C) once daily
      continuing through the end of the Treatment Period (Week 12). Subjects will return to the
      study site for a follow-up visit (Visit 9, Week 13) approximately 1 week after the last dose
      of study medication.

      Each subject's participation in the study will be approximately 14 weeks unless they
      withdraw early from the study. For subjects who complete the study, Visit 9 (which can occur
      between Day 86 and 92) will be considered their end-of-study visit.
