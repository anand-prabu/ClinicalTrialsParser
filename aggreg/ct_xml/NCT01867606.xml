    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies how well serum bovine immunoglobulin protein
      isolate works in improving quality of life and post-operative recovery in patients with
      gynecological cancer after undergoing surgery. Serum bovine immunoglobulin supplementation
      may improve the quality of life of patients with gynecological cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the time-to-quality of life (QOL) improvement from baseline in postoperative
      gynecological cancer patients who are receiving oral serum bovine immunoglobulin (SBI) vs.
      placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the surgical complication rates between oral SBI vs. placebo up to 1 month
      post-surgery (safety endpoint).

      II. To compare the QOL, as derived from the previously-validated Symptom Distress Scale, the
      Postoperative Quality of Life questionnaire (PQL), and the uniscale (overall QOL item)
      between patients receiving oral SBI vs. placebo.

      III. To compare the grade 2 or worse adverse event rates for patients receiving oral SBI vs.
      placebo.

      IV. To characterize the adverse event profile of oral SBI in postoperative gynecological
      cancer patients (safety endpoint).

      V. To compare supplement adherence between patients receiving oral SBI vs. placebo.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether candidate biomarkers are modified with SBI versus placebo.

      II. As part of ongoing research, to bank leftover blood samples for future studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive SBI orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-28.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.

    <description>All 14 of the individual items from the PQL tool, along with the 4 additional items after the PQL questions will be analyzed and compared between the 2 intervention arms. Differences between post-randomization and baseline QOL scores will be analyzed and compared between the 2 arms using a Wilcoxon Rank-sum test. Also, other graphical and statistical methods will be used to compare the QOL between the 2 arms over time.</description>
