  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will agree to be randomized to either surgery or non-operative management following
      a first episode of Hinchey II diverticulitis.  Information will also be collected on rates
      of recurrence rates and major complications in both groups.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility of randomizing patients with a first episode of
      diverticulitis with abscess defined by CT scan amenable to drainage to observation or
      elective sigmoid resection.  The study will also gather preliminary data on relative safety
      of surgery and observation.

    <description>The primary outcome in this feasibility study is whether or not patients will agree to be in the trial.  Eligible patients will be approached and we will record what proportion of patients agree to participate.  For those who decline enrollment, we will ascertain what aspect of the study is not acceptable to them.</description>
