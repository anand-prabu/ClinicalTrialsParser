  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve blocks are used to decrease the amount of pain you have after surgery. We are asking
      you to take part in a research study. This research study will test whether adding a
      medicine called clonidine to nerve blocks helps to improve them. Nerve blocks typically last
      less than a day after surgery. We are looking for ways to make them work better and last
      longer. Clonidine is approved for use as a blood pressure medicine. Its use in nerve blocks
      is investigational, but it may help nerve blocks to last longer. Adding clonidine to nerve
      blocks may also decrease the amount of pain medicine a person has after surgery. All people
      who enter this study will receive a nerve block with the normal medicine, but half of people
      will also have clonidine added to their nerve block. This study will enroll 60 participants
      from UAB hospitals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient undergoing foot or ankle surgery with popliteal nerve block planned for
             postoperative analgesia.

          2. Adult, 19 years of age and older.

          3. Subject classified as American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class 1, 2, or 3. The
             ASA defines these statuses as follows: 1-A normal healthy patient. 2-A patient with
             mild systemic disease. 3-A patient with severe systemic disease.

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any subject not classified as an ASA 1, 2, or 3.

          2. Allergy/intolerance to local anesthetic, clonidine, and/or oxycodone.

          3. Subject with a history of continuous opioid use for greater than one month prior to
             surgery.

          4. Pre-existing neurologic deficit in lower extremity (surgical site).

          5. Clinically significant coagulopathy (hemophilia, von Willebrand disease).

          6. Patients who fail to follow the UAB Department of Anesthesiology Algorithm for the
             Preoperative Management of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) or an
             Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB). A copy of the algorithm can be found in Appendix
