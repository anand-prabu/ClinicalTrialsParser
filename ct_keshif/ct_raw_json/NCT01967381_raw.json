A rigorous, inpatient human\n      laboratory study will be conducted. The proposed study is innovative and important because\n      it will provide the impetus for the conduct of double blind, placebo-controlled trials to\n      further demonstrate the efficacy of combined oxazepam and naltrexone for managing\n      methamphetamine dependence."
