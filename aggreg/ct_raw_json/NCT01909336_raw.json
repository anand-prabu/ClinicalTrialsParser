Each\n      group will be randomized to receive 3 types of interventions: 0.3% Saline (hypotonic\n      solution), 0.45% Saline (hypotonic solution) or 0.9% Saline (isotonic solution).  In\n      non-dehydrated patients the daily total volume of liquid infused will be determined by the\n      volumetric Holliday- Segar* formula and the daily total volume will be calculated by adding\n      the maintenance requirements (using the Holliday Segar formula) to the fluid deficit\n      (according to percent of estimated weight**) in dehydrated patients.\n\n      The glucose concentrations in the first group will be 3.3%, and in group 2 and 3 will be 5%.\n      The potassium concentration will be 20mEq/L in all groups. Blood samples will be collected\n      before, 8 hours and 24 hours after the start of intravenous fluid, for the analysis of\n      sodium, potassium, glucose, urea and creatinine. The adverse clinical outcomes at 8 and 24\n      hours of the start of intravenous fluid will also be recorded. The sodium plasma level, the\n      incidence of hyponatremia and the adverse clinical outcomes will be compared.\n\n      *0-10 kilogram (kg): 100ml/kg per day; 10-20 kg: 1000 ml + 50 ml/kg/day over 10 kg; >20 kg:\n      1500 ml + 20ml/ kg over 20kg\n\n      ** In patients under 10 kg correspond to a loss of 5% (50 mL/kg) in mild dehydration and 10%\n      in moderate dehydration. In 10 kg or more: 3% (30 mL/kg) in mild dehydration and 6% (60\n      mL/kg) in moderate dehydration."
