However, there are a considerable\n      number of patients who continue to have recurrent ischemic events despite this treatment\n      regimen. These observations underscore the need for more potent antiplatelet therapies.\n      Recently, two P2Y12 receptor inhibitors have been approved for clinical use: prasugrel and\n      ticagrelor. Both prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown to be associated with more potent\n      antiplatelet effects compared with clopidogrel. These more favorable pharmacodynamic effects\n      translate into reduced ischemic event rates, at the expense of an increased risk of bleeding\n      in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Overall, these drugs are associated with an\n      improved net clinical benefit. These findings from large-scale clinical investigations have\n      led to approval of prasugrel and ticagrelor. However, to date there are limited head-to-head\n      comparisons of these two new agents."
