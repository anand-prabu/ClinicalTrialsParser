The investigators think that this supination is caused by lateral rotation in\n      the shoulder.  The main lateral rotator of the shoulder is the infraspinatus muscle, which\n      is innervated by the suprascapular nerve (SSN).The investigators hypothesized that optimal\n      positioning of the hand for surgery on the dorsal side of the hand may be achieved by\n      performing a SSN block (SSNB) in addition to the LSIB."
