Group 1 will receive fluoxetine; Group 2 will receive EMDR; and Group 3 will\n      receive inactive placebo. Patients will then stop treatment and have evaluations, including\n      psychological tests, at the time treatment is stopped, 8 weeks later, and at 6 months.\n\n      An individual may be eligible for this study if he/she:\n\n      Has PTSD and is 18 to 65 years old."

            "textblock": "To compare the short-term and long-term efficacy of two different treatment approaches in\n      widespread use in clinical settings for treating patients with post-traumatic stress\n      disorder (PTSD): fluoxetine (which acts directly on biological systems) vs a psychological\n      treatment, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). To clarify: 1) the\n      differential treatment effects of these different treatment modalities; 2) whether symptom\n      improvement is accompanied by changes in pathophysiology; and 3) the long-term effectiveness\n      of these treatments.\n\n      In recent years a variety of treatment approaches have been shown to be effective in the\n      treatment of PTSD.  These include prolonged exposure therapies (PE), stress inoculation\n      training (SIT), EMDR and psychopharmacological treatment with serotonin re-uptake blockers.\n      While PE has been compared with SIT and a study is currently under way comparing\n      cognitive-behavioral treatment with EMDR, no study as yet has compared the relative merits\n      of pharmacotherapy alone vs an exposure treatment. While it is commonly held that, in order\n      to recover, people with PTSD need to \"process\" their traumatic memories, treatments that do\n      not involve the processing of traumatic memories (such as SIT or pharmacotherapy) may be\n      just as effective. In clinical practice, many patients with PTSD appear to be effectively\n      treated with pharmacological agents alone, without trauma-focused therapy.\n\n      Patients are randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) a double-blind\n      psychopharmacological treatment (fluoxetine); 2) a manualized treatment which focuses on\n      \"processing\" traumatic memories (EMDR); or 3) a placebo control group.  After 8 weeks of\n      active treatment, subjects are evaluated, cease treatment, and are assessed again after\n      another 8 weeks and at 6 months in order to evaluate the long-term effects.  Training raters\n      remain blind to the subjects' treatment condition throughout the study. Treatment outcome is\n      assessed with a multi-modal psychological and biological assessment battery including: 1)\n      standard psychological tests for PTSD (CAPS); 2) neuroendocrine function (cortisol); and 3)\n      psychophysiological response to traumatic scripts (pre-post changes in heart social and\n      occupational functioning).  Treatment adherence is monitored throughout the study."
