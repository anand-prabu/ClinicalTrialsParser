      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of combining
      cyclin B1/WT-1/CEF (antigen)-loaded DC vaccination with preoperative chemotherapy, and to
      combine DC vaccination with preoperative chemotherapy in addition to IL-1 blockade with
      anakinra in patients with locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer (LA TNBC).

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to determine pathologic complete response rates,
      with and without anakinra; disease-free survival; to assess immune biomarkers of immunity
      (antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity and TH2 T cells) in breast cancer biopsy specimens
      and blood samples in patients receiving DC vaccinations, with and without IL-1 blockade with
      anakinra; and to assess the feasibility of immunizing LA TNBC patients with patient-specific
      tumor antigens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that human breast cancers can be immunogenic, and that enhancing
      the immune effector function already present may augment the cytotoxic effects of standard
      therapies.

      Vaccination is an  attractive strategy because of its expected inducement of both
      therapeutic T cell immunity (effector T cells) and protective T cell immunity
      (tumor-specific memory T cells that can control tumor relapse). Clinical studies have now
      demonstrated that immunity against tumor antigens can be enhanced in cancer patients by
      vaccination with ex vivo-generated tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs). This strategy
      capitalizes on the unique capacity of DCs to prime lymphocytes and to regulate and maintain
      immune responses.

      In addition, blockade of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) represents a novel approach to breast cancer
      immunotherapy. Cancer cells induce interleukin-1β (IL-1 β) secretion from DCs and monocytes
      in a contact-dependent fashion. This is mediated by cancer cell-derived TGF- β. IL-1 β
      induces Thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP) production from breast cancer cells lines in a
      dose and contact dependent manner. TSLP-neutralizing antibodies are found to block up
      regulation of OX40L by tumor- infiltrating mDCs, and consequently block mDCs' capacity to
      generate iTH2 cells (CD4+ T cells) and to accelerate tumor development in vivo.33 Thus,
      interference with the TSLP-OX40L-IL13 axis will allow modification of cancer-associated
      inflammation and thereby offer a novel therapeutic approach for patients with TNBC. Results
      showed high levels of IL-1 β in the breast cancer microenvironment. Anakinra is a
      recombinant soluble non-glycosylated homolog of human IL-1Rα that competitively inhibits
      binding of IL-1α and IL-1 β to the receptor type. Administration of the IL-1R antagonist,
      anakinra, is thought to prevent tumor growth in vivo, blocks OX40L+ expression on DCs, and
      blocks iTH2 generation in vivo.

      Our goals are to boost T cell immunity targeted against breast cancer utilizing a tumor
      antigen-loaded DC vaccine, to reverse the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment by IL-1
      blockade, to enhance chemotherapy effectiveness and decrease tumor metastagenicity, and to
      decrease the recurrence rates of LA TNBC. Patients with LA TNBC will be treated with a
      combination of antigen-loaded DC vaccinations along with standard preoperative chemotherapy,
      to improve TNBC immunogenicity and to increase the pCR rate achieved with standard therapy.
      The trial will consist of 2 patient cohorts. In the first group, patients will receive DC
      vaccinations in combination with preoperative chemotherapy. In the second group, IL-1
      blockade with anakinra will be added to the treatment regimen.
