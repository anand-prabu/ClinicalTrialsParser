            "textblock": "This is a study of select drug therapies in patients with salivary gland cancer. The study\n      has two phases: a molecular profiling phase (phase 1) and a treatment phase (phase 2).\n\n      In molecular profiling phase of the study, participants will provide a sample of their tumor\n      tissue to test for changes in certain genes that show whether certain drug treatments will\n      be more useful than others.\n\n      Once participants have undergone molecular profiling, they will be offered a drug treatment\n      depending on the results. Certain drug treatments are designed to target certain gene\n      changes. If there is a matching drug treatment, participants will be offered that treatment\n      (either outside a clinical trial or within a clinical trial). If there are no gene changes\n      or there are changes to genes were there are no drug treatments available for those certain\n      changes, participants will be offered the study drug, Selinexor.\n\n      Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. Research shows that one way cancer cells can\n      grow uncontrollably is when certain proteins, called exporter proteins, are present in high\n      levels in the body. These proteins prevent certain other proteins important in protecting\n      cells from becoming cancerous and important in the controlling the growth of cells, from\n      working. The study drug Selinexor is new class of drug called Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear\n      Export (SINE) that blocks the exporter proteins from working which may allow the other\n      proteins to work and slow or stop tumors from growing."
