            "textblock": "The investigators in this study are concerned about the harmful effects of oxygen exposure\n      in newborn infants, particularly at high concentrations.  Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is an\n      FDA approved drug for the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) in term and\n      late-preterm babies greater than 34 weeks gestation.  Hypoxic respiratory failure occurs\n      when a patient's lungs cannot get enough oxygen into their bloodstream.  This condition is\n      traditionally treated with high concentrations of oxygen and most often requires the patient\n      be placed on a ventilator (breathing machine). The administration of inhaled nitric oxygen\n      directly into the lungs often improves blood oxygen levels and allows caretakers to reduce\n      the amount of oxygen given to the baby.  The purpose of this research study is to evaluate\n      if giving the inhaled nitric oxide earlier in the course of disease improves the\n      effectiveness of the drug, reduces the amount of cellular injury from oxygen exposure, and\n      decreases the total amount of time a patient requires supplemental oxygen.  This study uses\n      an FDA approved drug in a new manner."
