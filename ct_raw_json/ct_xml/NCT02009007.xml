  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liberal fluid administration is one of risk factors of developing acute lung injury (ALI) in
      thoracic surgery. Therefore, the investigators try to restrain fluid administration, and in
      the case of intraoperative hypotension, the investigators often administer vasoactive agents
      or inotropes. One lung ventilation (OLV) which is routinely employed for thoracic surgery
      decrease arterial oxygenation and oxygen delivery to brain can be also decreased. In this
      study, the investigators compared dopamine and phenylephrine in respect to maintaining
      cerebral oxygen saturation in major thoracic surgery. The investigators hypothesis is that
      dopamine is better than phenylephrine to maintain cerebral oxygen saturation in thoracic
      surgery.

    <textblock>
      A 'restrictive' intraoperative fluid regimen, avoiding hypovolaemia but limiting infusion to
      the minimum necessary reduced major complications after complex surgery. This restrictive
      fluid regimen is especially relevant in thoracic surgery since acute lung injury is known to
      be related to large amount of fluid administration during operation to treat hypotension.
      One study suggests that, for every 500-mL increase in perioperative fluids, there is an odds
      ratio of 1.17 for developing ALI after lung resection. Slinger suggested that fluid should
      be restricted just to the point of maintaining urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/h, and vasopressors
      may be used if tissue perfusion is inadequate. Therefore, restriction of fluid
      administration and treatment of hypotension which is not caused by major hemorrhage with
      vasoactive agents could be a basic concept in thoracic anesthesia.

      Patients who undergoing lung resection surgery usually receive one lung ventilation (OLV).
      Decrease of systemic oxygenation occurs during OLV due to intrapulmonary shunt. During OLV,
      significant decrease in cerebral oxygenation (SctO2) is also known to occur and low SctO2 is
      related to postoperative complications.

      Because the endpoint of hemodynamic optimization is to improve oxygen delivery to major
      organs, understanding how the administration of vasoactive agents affects cerebral perfusion
      and oxygenation, the most important organ in the body is of major clinical relevance.
      Recently published studies show that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-guided brain
      protection protocols might lead to reduced neurocognitive complications and improved
      postoperative outcomes.

      However, there have been no data on which agent between dopamine and phenylephrine, the most
      commonly used aged during operation against hypotension, is better in maintaining cerebral
      oxygen saturation during thoracic surgery. Therefore, the investigators try to compare
      dopamine and phenylephrine continuous infusion in respect to maintaining SctO2 in major
      thoracic surgery.

      In addition, acute kidney injury (AKI) develops in around 6% of patients after lung
      resection surgery and AKI is related to poor prognosis and prolonged duration of hospital
      admission.Therefore, the investigators also tried to find which agent is better to maintain
      urinary output during operation and reduce postoperative AKI. The investigators also found
      there is difference in postoperative delirium incidence between dopamine and phenylephrine
      continuous infusion.

      The primary aims of the study were (i) to investigate the effect of phenylephrine and
      dopamine continuous infusion on cerebral SctO2 (ii) to identify the hemodynamic variables
      [mean blood pressure, cardiac output, heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV)] which are
      responsible for the changes in cerebral SctO2 induced by phenylephrine and dopamine
      treatments.
