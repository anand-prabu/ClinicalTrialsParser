Rehydration can be achieved with oral rehydratation solution (ORS).\n      Even though ORS has reduced the mortality and morbidity very significantly, it has no effect\n      on the duration of diarrhea, stool consistency and frequency and remains underused. ESPGHAN\n      and ESPID published together an evidence based guideline and stated that in the management\n      of acute gastroenteritis rehydration is the key treatment and that selected probiotics may\n      reduce the duration and intensity of symptoms and can be used as an adjuvant to ORS. A\n      recent Cochrane review including 56 trials in children concluded that speci\ufb01c probiotics\n      reduce the duration of diarrhea with about 24 hours and decrease the frequency of defecation\n      on the second day. Current evidence also indicates that probiotic effects are\n      strain-specific. Lactobacillus LGG and Saccharomyces boulardii  are the best studied\n      strains. However, more research is needed to guide the use of particular probiotic regimens\n      and strains and as there is still no evidence of efficacy for many preparations. The aim of\n      this study was to evaluate effects of different probiotics on the duration of acute\n      infectious diarrhea."
