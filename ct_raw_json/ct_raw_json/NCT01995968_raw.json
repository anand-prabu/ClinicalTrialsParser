SGA births will be defined as a birthweight below the 10th percentile of\n      French customised birth weight curves.\n\n      Our secondary objectives are\n\n        -  to identify determinants of antenatal detection of FGR among a representative sample of\n           SGA births, with a special interest in the definition of FGR. Our hypothesis is that\n           births who are SGA by customised birthweight curves and non-SGA by population\n           birthweight curves, are not detected antenatally, despite the current strategy\n           including the use of umbilical Doppler.\n\n        -  to analyse prenatal care of a subsample of SGA stillbirths with and without detection\n           of FGR by a confidential enquiry."

This registry includes all cases of childhood disability as well\n      as all stillbirths to residents in these districts. Its objective is to monitor the trends\n      in stillbirth and chid disability, and to identify conditions associated with these events.\n      The three participating districts constitute a population-based sample of 30 000 births per\n      year. The RHEOP registry uses the WHO definition of a stillbirth, i.e., \"the birth of a baby\n      with a birth weight of 500 g or 22 or more completed weeks of gestation who died before or\n      during labor and birth\". Its completeness is checked by matching its database with three\n      data sources : results of placental examination and fetal autopsy, adjacent register of\n      fetal anomalies, and regional reference center for prenatal diagnosis.\n\n      Stillbirths are identified in maternity hospitals thanks to collaborating midwifes and\n      routinely collected data. Several specific investigators, who are trained nurses, midwives\n      or physicians, complete a standardized form based on the medical record for each case.\n\n      For the purpose of the project, additional data will be collected allowing to describe\n      prenatal care including ultrasound and Doppler examinations, and obstetrical management.\n      Healthcare professionals (GP, midwife, obstetricians and gynecologists) will be solicited if\n      data are missing in maternity medical records. SGA stillbirths in 2012 and 2013 will be\n      included.\n\n      Consecutive SGA livebirths to residents in Is\u00e8re, Savoie and Haute-Savoie, will be\n      identified by the same way. Two months (probably october and november 2013)are approximately\n      needed to record the sample size of controls."
