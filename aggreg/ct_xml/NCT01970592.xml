  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis, strictly defined as (muscular) weakness affecting one side of the body, is seen
      in three-quarters of individuals following stroke. Weakness in this population results from
      both neural and muscular factors which include, respectively, the ability to activate
      skeletal muscle as well as the force generating capacity of the muscle. Our overall goal is
      to improve walking in persons post-stroke by training subjects with an intervention that
      specifically targets existing neural and muscular impairments, thereby facilitating
      locomotor recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A primary impairment associated with post-stroke hemiparesis is the failure to make rapid
      graded adjustment of muscle force (i.e. muscle power) within the context of purposeful
      complex synergies (e.g., coordination during walking). Not surprisingly, the impact of
      stroke on walking is significant, with less than 50% of survivors progressing to independent
      community ambulation. Even among those who achieve independent ambulation, significant
      residual deficits persist in balance and gait speed, with ~75% of persons post-stroke
      reporting limitations in mobility related to walking.  Muscle weakness is the most prominent
      motor consequence among the nearly 6 million survivors of stroke living in the United States
      and the strongest predictor of functional disability in this large clinical cohort. To date,
      the physiological mechanisms that contribute to muscle dysfunction in hemiparetic subjects
      are largely unstudied.  Moreover, evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions aimed at
      attenuating impaired muscle function and the ensuing functional consequences in the
      post-stroke population is equivocal and viable therapeutic options to remediate hemiparetic
      muscle weakness remain among the most pressing challenges for biomedical research. We
      propose that impaired muscle power (the product of muscle strength and velocity) generation
      is causal of functional (walking) disability post-stroke. In addition, coordination deficits
      are also critical determinants of functional performance. We have developed a comprehensive
      theoretical framework that defines and measures the factors underlying disordered muscle
      function and coordination and will apply this framework to Post-stroke Optimization of
      Walking using Explosive Resistance (POWER) training. Our goals over the four year funding
      period are to 1) quantify neural and muscular adaptations that contribute to impaired muscle
      power generation post-stroke; 2) assess effects of POWER training on neural and muscular
      adaptations in paretic and non-paretic muscle; and 3) determine the relationship between
      changes in neural and muscular adaptations following POWER training and locomotor
      improvements. Innovative aspects of the proposed work include the novel training
      intervention; the advanced magnetic resonance assessments; as well as the unique measure of
      the coordination that we propose. It is our belief that: a) neural and muscular adaptations
      following stroke are associated with impaired muscle power generation as well as locomotor
      ability, b) POWER training attenuates functional deficits by addressing the underlying
      neural and muscular elements and c) functional improvements following training are
      predicated on improving the most prominent neural and muscular contributors to muscle power
      generation.  If correct, the data generated will provide an entirely new level of evidence
      regarding the effectiveness of this novel intervention strategy on improving functional
      performance as well as the importance of peripheral muscle properties as predictors of
      locomotor ability post-stroke.

    <description>The strength of your upper and lower leg muscles will be measured by asking you to contract your muscles as forcefully as possible.  Testing will be conducted at a range of different movement speeds (0-240 ï¿½/s) on a specialized machine called an isokinetic dynamometer.  Both legs may be tested.  This testing is designed to assess your ability to generate muscle power. Before testing you will be asked to perform 5 minutes of low intensity cycling.  Strength testing will include movements at the hip, knee and ankle in both legs.</description>
