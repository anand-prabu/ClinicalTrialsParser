for this reason\n             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use an effective contraceptive\n             method; women of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7\n             days prior to registration; since interactions with oral contraceptives cannot be\n             excluded at present, male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree to\n             employ an effective barrier method of birth control throughout the study and for up\n             to 3 months following discontinuation of study drug\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\n          -  World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for CMMOL:\n\n               -  Persistent peripheral blood monocytosis > 1 x 10^9/L\n\n               -  Absence of the Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene\n\n               -  Fewer than 20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow\n\n               -  Dysplasia in one or more myeloid lineages;

because there is an unknown but\n             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the\n             mother with STI-571, STI-571 should not be administered   patients who are\n             breastfeeding\n\n          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from\n             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with STI-571; appropriate\n             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy\n             when indicated\n\n          -  Because warfarin is metabolized through the CYP450 system, and since gastrointestinal\n             bleeding may occur with STI-571, no therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin will be\n             permitted in patients participating in this study; as an alternative, therapeutic\n             anticoagulation may be accomplished using low-molecular weight heparin (e.g. Lovenox)\n             or heparin"
