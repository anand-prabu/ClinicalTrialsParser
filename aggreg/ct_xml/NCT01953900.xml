  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-T cells (also called
      iC9-GD2-CAR-VZV-CTLs), and additionally to evaluate if a VZV vaccine can improve the
      expansion and persistence of infused T cells, to learn what the side effects are, and to see
      whether this therapy might help patients with advanced sarcomas.  Because there is no
      standard treatment for recurrent/refractory sarcomas at this time or because the currently
      used treatments do not work fully in all cases, patients are being asked to volunteer to
      take part in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      Investigators have found from previous research that a new gene can be put into T cells that
      will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. Investigators now want to see if a new
      gene can be put in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells.
      The new gene is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and consists of an antibody called
      14g2a that recognizes GD2, a protein that is found on sarcoma cells (GD2-CAR). In addition,
      it contains parts of the CD28 and OX40 genes which can stimulate T cells to make them live
      longer.

      Investigators have found that CAR-T cells can kill some of the tumor, but they don't last
      very long in the body and so the tumor eventually comes back. T cells that recognize the
      virus that causes chicken pox, varicella zoster virus (VZV), remain in the bloodstream for
      many years especially if they are stimulated or boosted by the VZV vaccine. Investigators
      will therefore insert the GD2-CAR gene into T cells that recognize VZV. These cells are
      called iC9-GD2-CAR-VZV-specific T cells but are referred to as GD2-T cells for simplicity.

      This study consists of two groups. The first group of patients will receive GD2-T cells
      followed six weeks later by vaccination with the VZV vaccine. The second group will receive
      GD2-T cells, the vaccine, and a second dose of GD2-T cells two days after the vaccine. We
      want to see whether giving a second dose of GD2-T cells right after the vaccine helps them
      to be more effective.

      Patients give blood to make GD2-T cells that are grown and frozen. To get the GD2-CAR to
      attach to the surface of the T-cell, a gene is inserted into the T-cell. As described in the
      Brief Summary, the gene contains the GD2-CAR. This is done using part of a virus (known as a
      retrovirus) that has been put into a vector made for this study and that will carry the
      antibody gene into the T cell. This retrovirus vector also helps identify the T cells in the
      patient's blood after they have been injected. Because the patients have received cells with
      a new gene in them they will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any
      long term side effects of gene transfer.

      When enrolled on this study, patients will be assigned to one of 6 groups of different doses
      of GD2-T cells. At the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose of GD2-T
      cells. Once that dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at
      the next higher dose. If the patient is assigned to dose level 1, 2 or 3 they will receive
      one infusion of GD2-T cells followed by a dose of the VZV vaccine. If the patient is
      assigned to dose level 4, 5 or 6 they will receive an infusion of GD2-T cells followed by a
      dose of the VZV vaccine followed by another infusion of GD2-T cells.

      An injection of cells will be given into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose.
      Before the injection is received, a dose of Benadryl and Tylenol will be given. The
      injection will take between 1 and 25 minutes. After the injection the patient will be
      followed in the clinic for 1 to 4 hours. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell
      and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital. After the
      GD2-T-cell injection the patient will be followed in the clinic or through communication
      with their primary doctor.

      Six weeks later, the patient will receive a dose of the VZV vaccine. This will be given as a
      subcutaneous (just under the skin) injection and takes less than a minute. The vaccine will
      also be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or
      Houston Methodist Hospital.

      Depending on when the patient enters the study, they may also receive a second dose of GD2-T
      cells two days after the vaccine. This second dose of GD2-T cells will be given the same way
      as the first dose. Approximately half the patients enrolled in the study will receive one
      dose and half will receive two doses of GD2-T cells.

      Medical tests before treatment--

      Before being treated, patients will receive a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function

        -  Measurements of their tumor by routine imaging studies. We will use the imaging study
           that was used before to follow the patient's tumor (Computer Tomogram (CT), Magnetic
           Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography(PET/CT)

      Medical tests during and after treatment--

      Patients will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and
      afterwards:

        -  Physical exams

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function

        -  Measurements of their tumor by routine imaging studies 6 and 12 weeks after the
           infusion

      To learn more about the way the GD2-T cells are working and how long they last in the body,
      an extra amount of blood, based on the patient's weight, up to a maximum of 60 mL (12
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken on the day of the GD2-T- cell infusion(s), (before and at
      the end of the T-cell infusion(s)), 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the GD2-T-cell infusion(s) and
      every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years.
      One additional blood sample might be drawn 3 to 4 days after the GD2-T-cell infusion(s);
      this is optional. For children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 mL
      (less than 1 teaspoon) per 2.2 lbs of body weight on any one day. This volume is considered
      safe, but may be decreased if the patient is anemic (has a low red blood cell count).
