Patients undergoing\n      full pharmacokinetic analyses receive a loading dose on week 0 and the subsequent 3 doses on\n      weeks 3-5.\n\n      NOTE: *All patients receive a total of 4 doses.\n\n      Cohorts of 2-8 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which at least 2 or 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 5 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 14 months."
