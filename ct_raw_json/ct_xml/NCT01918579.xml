  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have showed that rapid point-of-care (POC) c-reactive protein (CRP) test can
      reduce inappropriate use of antibiotic at primary health care level. In Vietnam, prevalence
      of antibiotic abuse for community acute respiratory infection has been reported. This study
      will test the hypothesis that CRP POC testing for patients with non-severe acute respiratory
      illness at primary healthcare stations reduces inappropriate antibiotic use safely.

      The study will be conducted at ten district health care facilities in Hanoi, Viet Nam.
      Investigators intend to enroll 2,000 participants aged 6-65 years with non-severe acute
      respiratory infection. Patients will be randomly allocated to the control or the
      intervention arm. Participants in the control group will be treated according to routine
      care. Participants in the intervention arm will have a CRP test, the results of which will
      be available to the health care practitioner to contribute to their diagnosis and treatment
      decisions.

      All patients will be followed-up via telephone call after 14 days. The study will compare
      the proportion of patients in each arm receiving any antibiotics within 2 weeks of study
      enrollment.
