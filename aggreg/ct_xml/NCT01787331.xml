    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test an investigational drug called itraconazole in the
      treatment of prostate cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm study of itraconazole dosed at 300 mg PO BID in patients with
      noncastrate, non-metastatic, biochemically relapsed prostate cancer after prior definitive
      local therapy. Simon's two stage minimax design will be followed for accrual and include an
      interim test for lack of efficacy. There is a pre-specified stopping rule for safety after
      10 patients have been treated for a minimum of 8 weeks of protocol therapy.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>To determine whether the proportion of patients who achieve a â‰¥ 50% decline in serum PSA after 12 weeks of protocol therapy with itraconazole dosed at 300 mg BID is superior to a historical control based upon the observed PSA response proportion in prior studies of non-castrating systemic therapy in men with biochemically relapsed hormone sensitive prostate cancer. PSA progression will be defined as follows: (1) If no PSA decline is observed on therapy, PSA progression will be defined as an increase in serum PSA &gt; 50% above the baseline PSA, and an absolute increase of &gt; 2 ng/mL above baseline, confirmed by repeat measurement at least 2 weeks later (2) If PSA declines on therapy, PSA progression will be defined as an increase in serum PSA &gt; 50% above the nadir PSA on therapy, and an absolute increase &gt; 2 ng/mL above the nadir, confirmed by repeat measurement at least 2 weeks later.</description>
