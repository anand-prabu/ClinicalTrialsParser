             achieving glycemic goal while on MDI of insulin

          -  Has HbA1c between 7.0% and 9.0%

          -  Has been on MDI of regular insulin, at a dose not to exceed 10 units/breakfast for at
             least 3 months or has been on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), at a
             dose not to exceed 10 units/breakfast, for at least 3 months and is willing to switch
             to an MDI insulin regimen for 1 day prior to enrollment and through the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has experienced recurrent severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance within 6 months
             before Visit 1 Screening

          -  Has a clinically significant medical condition that could potentially affect study
             participation and/or personal well-being, as judged by the investigator, including
             but not limited to the following conditions:

               1. Hepatic disease

               2. Renal disease

                  virus, or hepatitis C virus)

          -  Is currently treated or has been previously treated with SYMLIN/pramlintide or has
             participated in a SYMLIN/pramlintide clinical study within 3 months of Visit 1
             (Screening).

             successful completion of the study and/or personal well-being

          -  Has donated blood within 2 months or is planning to donate blood during the study.

          -  Has received any investigational drug within 1 month

          -  Has known allergies or hypersensitivity to any component of study treatment.

          -  Is an immediate family member of personnel directly affiliated with the study at the
             clinical study site, or is directly affiliated with the study at the clinical study
             site.

          -  Is employed by Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Amylin) (that is an employee, temporary
