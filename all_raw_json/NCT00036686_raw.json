Patients are\n      stratified according to the phase of the menstrual cycle at time of biopsy and time of\n      surgery (follicular phase [i.e., during first 7 days of menstrual cycle] vs luteal phase\n      [i.e., after day 7 of the menstrual cycle]). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral soy protein isolate twice daily and oral multivitamins\n           once daily.\n\n        -  Arm II:Patients receive oral placebo twice daily and oral multivitamins once daily.\n\n      In both arms, treatment continues for 2-4 weeks depending on time from study entry to\n      planned surgical procedure.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 106 patients (53 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 18 months."
