Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and\n      filgrastim together with peripheral stem cell transplantation from a sibling donor works in\n      treating patients with hematologic cancer."
