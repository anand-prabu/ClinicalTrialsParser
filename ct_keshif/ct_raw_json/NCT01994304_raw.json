SCC is thus\n      expected to improve the quality of delivery care practices and is currently being\n      implemented in Community Health Centres (CHCs) and District Hospitals (DHs) across seven\n      districts in Rajasthan over a two-year time period (2013 to 2015). PHFI and SJRI will\n      independently evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the SCC in preventing\n      perinatal deaths and its impact on maternal and newborn complications. Evaluation will\n      include data collection from the seven intervention districts and six control districts for\n      a total of 13 districts in Rajasthan. The estimated sample size of 200,000 births is\n      required to demonstrate a 15% reduction in perinatal mortality in the intervention districts\n      compared to the control districts. Data on this will collected over a period of 17 months\n      (November 2013 to April 2015).\n\n      To estimate perinatal mortality (the main outcome of this study), information on newborn\n      outcomes (stillbirths and early neonatal mortality) will be collected from various records\n      at the study facilities.  Data collection will be done electronically using a mobile phone\n      through software specifically developed for this purpose. The data sources include record\n      registers from labor room; facility based newborn centres (FBNC) at DH and CHCs; and Monthly\n      Death Records at the district.\n\n      For a better understanding on how maternal and neonatal complications are diagnosed and\n      managed at the facility, in-depth interviews will also be conducted biannually with the\n      service providers (specialists, physicians, labor room staff nurses, and pharmacists) from\n      the District hospitals and CHCs. In addition, interviews will also focus on understanding\n      the use, acceptability and feasibility of the SCC among various types of providers.\n\n      Cost of this intervention will be estimated and cost effectiveness in terms of cost per\n      perinatal death prevented will be calculated.\n\n      Permission for this study and data collection has been obtained from the Department of\n      Health and Family Welfare, Government of Rajasthan."
