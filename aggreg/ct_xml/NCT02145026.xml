    <textblock>
      This study examines the safety profile and effectiveness of Recormon treatment in adult
      patients with symptomatic anemia associated with low/intermediate-1-risk MDS. The design
      consists of a 2-week baseline phase, a 12-week treatment phase where Recormon dosage will be
      adjusted on the basis of erythroid response and end-of-study visit.
