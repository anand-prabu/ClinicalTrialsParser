We are performing a combined\n      dose-finding - chronic efficacy study.\n\n      The study is a randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blinded trial. The follow\u2010up period is\n      6 months. 70 patients with chronic heartfailure will be included.\n\n      Specific aims\n\n        1. Determine safety of administration of Mirabegron to patients with heart failure.\n\n        2. Determine if treatment with Mirabegron for 6 months induces beneficial cardiac\n           structural remodelling in patients with heart failure.\n\n        3. Determine if Mirabegron improves symptoms and exercise capacity as indicated by\n           questionnaires and 6 min walk test in patients with heart failure.\n\n        4. Determine effects of Mirabegron on cardiac conduction, repolarisation and rhythms and\n           arrhythmias in patients with heart failure.\n\n        5. Determine effects of Mirabegron on circulating biomarkers in patients with heart\n           failure."
