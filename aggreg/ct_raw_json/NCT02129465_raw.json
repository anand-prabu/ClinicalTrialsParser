            "textblock": "Maternal Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy may cause significant morbidity in the\n      fetus. Intrauterine CMV transmission occurs mainly during primary maternal infections, with\n      a maternal-fetal transmission rate of about 40%. The mechanisms dictating CMV intrauterine\n      transmission are unknown, and transmission is currently thought to be dependent on multiple\n      factors, including the maternal and fetal immune system.\n\n      To investigate the mechanism of transmission approaching laboratory prediction of\n      transmission, the investigators collect blood from pregnant women with primary CMV\n      infection, and analyze several characteristics. These include CMV viral load, cytokine\n      profile in response to in-vitro stimulation with CMV peptides, meticulous analysis of anti\n      CMV antibodies, maternal DNA polymorphism and microarray of gene expression.\n\n      These results will be analysed according to transmission as indicated by a positive culture\n      / Polymerase chain transcription of amniotic fluid  or newborns urine / saliva."
