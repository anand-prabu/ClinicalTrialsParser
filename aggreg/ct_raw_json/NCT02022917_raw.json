This study will\n      also investigate progression free and to assess the quality of life.\n\n      A Simon minimax two-stage design is employed to determine permit early stopping when a\n      moderately long sequence of initial adverse events occurs. Under this two-stage design, 13\n      subjects are enrolled at the first stage. If there are > 3 subjects discontinue treatment\n      due to significant AE in the stage-1, then stop the trial. Otherwise, the second stage is\n      implemented by including the other 14 subjects. The treatment safety will be evaluated and\n      ensured by the occurrence rate of significant AE (or non AE). In stage-1, postoperative\n      adjuvant cycles 2-6 will be observed for defined significant AE.\n\n      Patients' or physicians' decision of discontinuation not because of the above-defined\n      significant AEs or due to cancer progression should not be counted as an end-point event."

Urine protein should be screened by urine\n             protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR). The UPCR has been found to correlate directly with\n             the amount of protein excreted in a 24 hour urine collection. Specifically, a UPCR of\n             1.0 is equivalent to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine collection. Obtain at\n             least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to be a 24\n             hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine levels\n             [separate requests]. The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and\n             creatinine concentration (mg/dL) The UPCR is derived as follows: protein\n             concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL).
