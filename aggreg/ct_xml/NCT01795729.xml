  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare optimal medical therapy alone versus percutaneous
      coronary intervention on top of medical therapy in the setting of heart transplant recipient
      coronary artery disease in a randomized trial.The primary endpoint assessed at 1 year is the
      composite of death, myocardial infarction, need for transitory or permanent ventricular
      assist device implantation, myocardial revascularization, occurrence or worsening of heart
      failure, any graft dysfunction and/or a decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction of at
      least 25% compared to baseline. The hypothesis of the study is the superiority of the
      interventional management over medical therapy alone in preventing the occurrence of the
      primary endpoint of the study.

      The hypothesis of the study is the superiority of the interventional management over medical
      therapy alone in preventing the occurrence of the primary endpoint of the study assessed 1
      year after randomization.

      Objectives: To demonstrate the superiority of the interventional management on top of
      optimal medical therapy over optimal medical therapy alone in preventing the occurrence of
      the primary endpoint of the study assessed 1 year after randomization

      Design : Multicenter, prospective randomized 1 :1, open-label blinded endpoint study

      Target population : Heart transplant recipients, aged ≥18 years, without coronary artery
      disease-related symptoms, with angiographically significant coronary artery stenoses (≥50%
      anatomically adequate for a revascularization by coronary angioplasty with stent
      implantation, with no contraindication to dual antiplatelet therapy associating aspirin and
      a P2Y12 inhibitorfor a duration of 12 monthsand with ni grade IA ACC/AHA indication for
      revascularization

      Inclusion period: 12 months (may be extended based on the inclusion rythme)

      Maximum duration of participation for patients : 13 months

      Total duration of the study : 37 months

      Primary endpoint : The composit of death, myocardial infarction, retransplantation,
      implantation of transitory or definitve ventricular assist devices, new or worsening heart
      failure, graft failure and/or a decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction of at least
      25% compared to baseline.The occurrence of any event qualifying for the primary endpoint
      will be assessed by a Cox survival analysis stratified on center.The primary endpoint will
      be assessed 12 months after randomization.

      Secondary endpoints : Any of the individual events defining the primary outcome at 1 year

      Number of patients to be included and power calculation : 80 patients per group. A 1 year
      primary endpoint rate of 30% in the active and 50% in with an inclusion period of 24 months
      and alpha=5% warants a 90% power using a cox model.
