  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      forced-dose titration in which adult subjects (18 years of age or older) with ADHD will be
      randomized to PRC-063 (25, 45, 70 or 100 mg) or placebo for four weeks of double-blind
      evaluation of safety and efficacy.  The study will have four phases: (1) screening and
      1-week washout; (2)baseline and double-blind, forced-dose titration over a 2-week period;
      (3) double-blind evaluation over a 2-week period; and (4) a 14-day safety follow-up.
      Subjects will be required to visit the site 6 times over a 5 week period.

      Screening and Washout: Subjects will be screened to establish eligibility for study
      participation. Subjects who meet eligibility requirements will undergo ADHD medication
      washout, if applicable.
