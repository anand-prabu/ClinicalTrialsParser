The only effective treatment for pancreatic cancer includes surgery.\n      However, only 20% of the patients have surgically treatable disease. Also, the 5-year\n      survival for the surgically treated patients is only 15%.\n\n      About 40% of the patients present with advanced disease with distant metastasis, and the\n      remaining 40% present with locally advanced unresectable cancer with the tumor invaded into\n      surrounding major vessels. For those with locally advanced disease, systemic chemotherapy\n      with or without radiotherapy provides palliation of the symptoms but cannot cure the\n      disorder. Systemic chemotherapy is given through peripheral vessels.\n\n      The investigators hypothesized that direct injection of the chemotherapeutic drug into the\n      tumor may help to boost the effect of systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in those with\n      locally advanced pancreatic cancer."
