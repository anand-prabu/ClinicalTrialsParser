Clinic staff will meet with a practice\n      facilitator (monthly and as needed), and will track study activities and submit invoices via\n      ICCIS reporting.  These invoices will be used to simulate a shared savings model where\n      clinics will be reimbursed based on their progress and effort towards their goals.\n\n      Clinics will set and work towards goals that they have chosen.  Goals for the control arm\n      are self-selected by the clinics themselves; goals for the invention arm are related to\n      high-value elements (HVE) that have been identified as areas that can improve patient\n      outcomes.  These HVE are:\n\n        1. Evidence-based Care Management Based on Need\n\n        2. Identification of At-Risk Populations\n\n        3. Patient Engagement and Alerts Based on Goals\n\n        4. Integrated Information for Care Management, especially around Utilization\n\n        5. Population Management Tools"
