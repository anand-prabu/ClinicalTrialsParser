  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, multicenter study involving patients with chronic HCV infection who
      had a liver transplantation; developed HCV-related liver fibrosis; achieved a sustained
      virologic response (SVR) following anti-HCV therapy; but still have fibrosis on liver biopsy
      to see if treatment with IDN-6556 is better than placebo in reversing or stopping the
      progression of the damage to the new liver caused by HCV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are data to suggest that with eradication of the HCV virus, improvements in liver
      fibrosis can be seen in the post-transplant population. However, amelioration of
      inflammatory activity, and deceleration of fibrosis progression is a gradual process over
      the course of many years.  This placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the effects
      of IDN-6556, compared to placebo, on markers of apoptosis and inflammation, and liver
      histology.
