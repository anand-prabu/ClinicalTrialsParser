            "textblock": "Currently, there is very little research to identify ways to decrease blood loss during D&E\n      (dilation and evacuation) procedures.  Many practitioners use uterotonics, including\n      oxytocin, to help minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage yet literature and\n      physiological evidence to support this practice is scarce. The investigators objective is to\n      determine whether routine use of intravenous oxytocin will affect bleeding outcomes at the\n      time of D&E at 18-24-weeks gestation.  To evaluate the hypothesis, investigators will\n      perform a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial at two sites, at University\n      of Hawaii and University of Washington, on subjects who present for D&E at 18-24-weeks over\n      approximately a 14-month period.  Standard D&E procedures will be performed by skilled\n      surgeons in both the outpatient setting (in Washington) and the hospital operating room (in\n      Hawaii).  In addition to the procedure, investigators will also follow a standardized\n      algorithm to manage excess, intraoperative bleeding and record blood loss.  The patient will\n      be followed only until discharged from the postoperative care unit during which time patient\n      satisfaction, pain score and postoperative bleeding will be assessed. No additional\n      follow-up after discharge home.  Primary outcome will be the rate at which providers\n      intervene to control blood loss during D&E procedures.  Secondary outcomes evaluated will\n      include measured blood loss, complication rates, procedure length, and postoperative pain\n      and satisfaction."
