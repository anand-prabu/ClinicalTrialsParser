  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to investigate the effectiveness, cost, safety,
      and long-term impact on quality of life of laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) in relation to
      abdominal hysterectomy (AH) for the treatment of benign gynecologic disease in women through
      a randomized surgical trial.

      The overall hypothesis is that neither mode of hysterectomy will be consistently superior to
      the other with respect to each of the three domains of complications, cost, and
      patient-centered outcomes. The overall goal of the study is to determine which clinically
      relevant factors may impact the choice of LH compared to AH.  The results of the study may
      be useful for clinicians, patients, hospital administrators and health policy makers.
