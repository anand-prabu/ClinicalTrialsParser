Thoracic epidural anesthesia performed using 0.375% or 0.5% ropivacaine\n      15mL followed by sedation consisting of propofol without muscle relaxation. After the\n      operation, thoracic epidural analgesia continued; supplemented by a continuous epidural\n      infusion of ropivacaine 0.15%, 2 ml/h with fentanyl 8mcg/h. At 1 hour, 2hour, 1 day, 2 day\n      and 3 day after the operation, postoperative surveillance consisted of the occurrence of\n      symptoms of Horner's syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and hyperemia) were performed by\n      anesthesiologists."
