Risk factors include: HCV RNA load level, HIV-HCV\n      co-infection, duration of labour, HCV genotype, child gender, and invasive procedures either\n      during pregnancy or at birth. Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT)\n      mainly occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy or at birth or around the birth\n      (El-Shabrawi et al., World Journal of  Gastroenterology 2013). Currently, using caesarian\n      section to reduce the risk of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT) is\n      still debated and not recommended in International Guidelines (EASL 2012). Spontaneous viral\n      clearance in infected children during childhood seems to occur in 20% of cases, with\n      predisposing genetic factors (Ruiz-Extremera A et al. Hepatology 2011 ; 53 : 1830-1838) but\n      data about this phenomenon are scarse (Rerksuppaphol S et al. J Gastroenterol Hepatol 2004),\n      justifying the study."
