It does not include interventions aimed at altering patient\n      outcome.\n\n      Advances in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) have resulted in\n      improved survival and prompted increased attention to the potential adverse late effects of\n      this procedure. Survivors of SCT are thought to be at risk for neurocognitive deficits as a\n      result of their exposure to a number of potentially neurotoxic agents.  Prior studies done\n      by our group and others have demonstrated generally stable cognitive function in the first 5\n      years following transplant, with little evidence of significant declines.  However, there\n      has been almost no research to date on the status of very long-term (> 5 years\n      post-transplant) survivors.  In this study, we will evaluate a large sample of long-term\n      survivors of allogeneic SCT using measures of intelligence, academic achievement, and\n      specific cognitive functions such as attention, working memory and processing speed.  We\n      will also obtain measures of behavioral functioning and quality of life.  We will examine\n      how this group of survivors are functioning relative to normative expectations, and in\n      comparison to community controls without a history of serious illness, matched on age,\n      gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.  We will also examine the relationship\n      between cognitive function and psychosocial function and quality of life in this population."

During their yearly visit to St. Jude,\n      eligible patients who agree to participate will undergo a single neurocognitive evaluation.\n      This evaluation will take place in the Psychology Clinic.

All measures selected for the study\n      have well-established psychometric properties, including acceptable reliability and\n      validity. All measures were standardized on large, representative samples of children and\n      adults and have age-specific norms.\n\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n      To examine and describe psychological outcomes in long-term (> 5 years) survivors of\n      allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (SCT) in childhood.  This will be\n      conducted in a one-time cross-sectional assessment using both performance based measures and\n      survey questionnaires.
