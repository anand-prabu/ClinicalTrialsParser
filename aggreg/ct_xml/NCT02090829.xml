      : The objective of this study is to determine the tolerability and therapeutic potential of
      oxytocin in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) when paired with a
      computer game intervention that is designed to enhance face perception skills. We designate
      two measures as our primary outcomes, based on prior published work with these
      interventions, and we propose a sample based on power analyses from these prior results.  A
      second objective of this study is to learn about the breadth of possible positive effects
      that this combination therapy might have for children with ASD. To this end, we include a
      host of other exploratory measures that assess aspects of social motivation and attention,
      social perception, and social cognition. Thus, a second objective is to conduct a &quot;signal
      finding&quot; study - to gather outcome data on a range of dependent variables that theoretically
      should be related to oxytocin's effects on social processes, but for which there are no
      prior data. The signal finding aspect of this study will provide the preliminary data needed
      to design a more targeted follow up study.

      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in 52 children and
      adolescents with ASD. Diagnosis will be confirmed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      (DSM) criteria, supported by the Autism Diagnostic Interview and the Autism Diagnostic
      Observation Schedule. Subjects will be randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo
      for a 5 day period with concomitant game play of the FaceStation computer games, developed
      at CHOP.  Measures of social function and cognition will be administered before and after
      the game play period. Two measures of social functioning will serve as our primary
      endpoints; all other measures will be treated as exploratory variables, with significance
      testing corrected for multiple comparisons.

      Recognizing faces is critical to social functioning, and can be improved for individuals
      with ASD by using intervention software in the form of appropriately designed computer
      games. The effects of this type of social intervention may be amplified with the concurrent
      use of oxytocin. Furthermore, these learning effects may impact social skills in general and
      translate to the level of the individual's everyday social behavior. Thus, the objective of
      this study is to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin in
      children and adolescents with ASD when paired with a computer game intervention that is
      designed to enhance face perception skills.

    <description>4)	Part/Whole Identity Test measures the extent to which the participant employed a featural or holistic face recognition strategy. In this task, a sample face is presented for 4 sec, followed by a test face composed of either two whole faces or two face parts. As expected in Part/Whole Identity, effect sizes ranged from a low 0.30 for the part mouth condition to a high of 0.81 for the whole eye condition, such that the condition measuring holistic processing in the eye region was most sensitive to group differences. This measure was also most sensitive to behavioral changes with the LFI intervention trial.</description>

    <description>Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (child version) (Baron-Cohen, et al., 2001) is a test of emotion recognition. This test asks children to pick the best word out of four options to describe the mental state of a set of eyes. The test includes 28 photographs of eyes with both affective (e.g., upset) and cognitive (e.g., thoughtful) mental state words as choices.</description>
