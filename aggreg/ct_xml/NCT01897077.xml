      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new method of administration of peanut
      sublingual immunotherapy, a dissolving peanut film, is effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is a common problem with no current treatment. Recent studies have shown some
      success with oral or sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of food allergy. Oral
      treatment, which requires very high doses, is associated with a small but appreciable risk
      of systemic reactions. Sublingual immunotherapy, which utilizes much smaller doses, is safer
      but constraints inherent in the available methods of sublingual administration have limited
      the utility of this method. Typically sublingual immunotherapy for food allergy has used
      either fresh foods or a simple liquid extract. These methods are not optimized for
      practicality or dwell duration in the mouth, and, thus far, dosing has been limited by the
      ability to make concentrated extracts and by the volume of extract that can be applied to
      the sublingual space. This study is being conducted to determine if a dissolving peanut
      extract film, will improve efficacy for immunotherapy for peanut allergy.
