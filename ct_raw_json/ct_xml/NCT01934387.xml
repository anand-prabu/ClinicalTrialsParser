      BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (WHO FRAX®)
      Taiwanese calculator is freely available on line to help osteoporosis management. However,
      its clinical utility for improving osteoporosis awareness and patient acceptance has not
      been validated in Taiwanese population.

      OBJECTIVES: This 11-month FRAX® based screening and referral program enrolling older adults
      participating in the geriatric health examinations (GHEs) at the National Taiwan University
      Hospital (NTUH) aiming at determine the patient acceptance of the tool and the program and
      to improve patient awareness in osteoporosis. The second aim is to look for the
      recommendations from the participating physicians to improve the FRAX® -based osteoporosis
      management model.

      METHODS: The NTUH GHE program is a two stage process to serve 3,000 older adults collecting
      annually from Mar. to Dec. Subjects will be enrolled to the current study at the stage 1 GHE
      visits after informed consent. Baseline questionnaires including the FRAX® tools will be
      distributed and expected to be returned at the stage 2 visits. Research assistants will
      calculate the 10-year predicted fracture risks for the participants during the waiting
      periods and present the numbers to the GHE physicians. High risks individuals will be
      referred to general geriatric clinic for further managements. All participants will be
      provided with osteoporosis and fracture educational material. Patient acceptance and
      awareness will be assessed. The study is to be started from Feb., to Oct., 2013 to enroll
      roughly 1,800 older adults assuming refusal rate about 40%.

      Qualitative interviews will be used to obtain recommendations from study geriatricians in
      Jul., 2013 to optimize the FRAX® based screening and management model.

      ANTICIPATED RESULTS:

      To estimate the 10 year fracture risks for GHE participants. To understand the acceptance of
      this FRAX® based model from GHE participants and the impacts on patient osteoporosis
      awareness.

      To calculate the economic benefits of this model on geriatric outpatient service.

      To obtain recommendations from study geriatricians to optimize the FRAX® based model for
      further disseminations.

    <description>The study expected to collect 1,800 cases that using the assessment tool (FRAX) for osteoporosis screening. The primary outcomes were 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture and 10-year probability of hip fracture.Investigators want to know what the percentages of elderly in high risk need to be transfer to geriatric department for further treatment.</description>
