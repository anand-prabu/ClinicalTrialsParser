Patients will be given different concentrations of the drug\n      (known as \"cohorts\") starting from a lower dose to a higher dose.\n\n      Single-Dose Treatment:\n\n      A thorough assessment of safety and tolerability will be performed before escalating to the\n      next higher dose. For example, the first 2 subjects will be dosed in a staggered fashion 24\n      hours apart. Provided that there are no significant safety signals up to 24 hours post-dose\n      for the first 2 subjects, the remaining 4 subjects will be dosed.  A thorough assessment of\n      safety and tolerability (through day 14 post-dose) will be performed by the safety review\n      committee before escalating to the next higher dose. Subjects enrolled in a SAD cohort will\n      be eligible to participate in a MAD or adaptive MAD cohort if eligibility criteria are met.\n\n      Multiple-Dose Treatment:\n\n      This design follows the same set-up as the Single-Dose Treatment.  Dosing will not commence\n      in the first MAD cohort until safety data from the second dose level SAD cohort has been\n      reviewed through Day 15. Successive MAD cohorts will only be dosed after safety data from\n      the previous, lower dose MAD cohort through Day 43 and the next higher dose SAD cohort\n      through Day 15, have been reviewed by the safety review committee. After all participants\n      have completed Day 43 in the MAD cohort, and additional adaptive MAD cohort will explore\n      once weekly dosing of up to the maximum tolerated MAD dose for 5 weeks."
