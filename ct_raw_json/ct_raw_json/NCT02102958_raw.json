Usual care in diabetes\n      self-management education (DSME) is to teach them to seek sighted assistance for regular\n      foot examination, yet clinical experience suggests that this advice is seldom heeded. One\n      possible solution is to teach use of the nonvisual senses of touch and smell for a\n      systematic, thorough foot self-examination. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare\n      the efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of nonvisual foot examination with usual care\n      (examination of the visually impaired person's feet by a sighted family member or friend)."
