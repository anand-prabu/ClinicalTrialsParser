      This is an open-label, parallel-group study to compare the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of IDN-6556 following a single 50 mg oral dose of IDN-6556 in subjects with
      mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (defined as Child-Pugh A, B, and C,
      respectively) and matched healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function.

        Matched Healthy Volunteers:

          -  Medically healthy as determined by the Investigator

          -  Supine blood pressure ≤145/90 mmHg

          -  No significant uncontrolled systemic or major illness that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude the subject from participating in and completing the
             study

          -  Demographically comparable to subjects with hepatic impairment as follows:

               1. Mean body weight within ±15 kg

               2. Mean age within ±10 years

               3. Similar gender ratio

        Subjects with Hepatic Impairment:

          -  Evidence of hepatic disease

               1. Score ≥ 2 on one of the Child-Pugh parameters, or

               2. Histological or imaging diagnosis of cirrhosis, or

               3. Presence of esophageal varices, or

               4. Abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or
                  alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels

          -  Meet one of the following criteria for Child-Pugh classification for hepatic
             impairment during Screening

               1. Mild hepatic impairment: Class A (Child-Pugh Scores 5-6 points)

               2. Moderate hepatic impairment: Class B (Child-Pugh Scores 7-9 points)

               3. Severe hepatic impairment: Class C (Child Pugh Scores 10-15 points)

          -  Supine blood pressure ≤160/100 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All Subjects:

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) upon serological testing

             disease, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or  alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
             that is considered clinically significant by the Investigator, etc.)

          -  Screening creatinine clearance &lt;80 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation

          -  History or presence of clinically concerning cardiac arrhythmias, or prolongation of
             Screening (pre-treatment) QT or QTc interval of &gt;450 milliseconds (msec)

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 28 drinks/week (1 drink = 150 mL of
             wine or 360 mL of beer or 45 mL of spirits) within 6 months of Screening

        Subjects with Hepatic Impairment:

          -  Fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function, as indicated by strongly
             varying or worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of hepatic impairment during
             Screening period and up to Day -1 (e.g., advanced ascites, infection of ascites,
             fever, active gastrointestinal bleeding)
