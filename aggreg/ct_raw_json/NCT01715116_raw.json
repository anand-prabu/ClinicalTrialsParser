However, ICD therapy is associated with a number of complications and\n      shocks that may impair patient quality of life and well being but also influence mortality.\n      Hence, reduction of ICD shocks by means of alternative programming of the device is\n      paramount for improving patient-centered outcomes and mortality.\n\n      The ENHANCED-ICD study will be a prospective, single-arm safety monitoring study. All\n      patients will receive Enhanced programming. Furthermore, patients will be asked to complete\n      a set of standardized and validated self-report questionnaires prior to ICD implantation, at\n      3-, 6-, and 12 months post implantation."
