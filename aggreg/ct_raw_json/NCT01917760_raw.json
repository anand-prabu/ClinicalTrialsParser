            "textblock": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the progressive loss of pancreatic\n      insulin-secreting beta-cells. This consequently leads to a lack of insulin and elevation of\n      blood sugar, namely hyperglycemia, which is a major cause for the development of diabetes\n      and its acute or chronic complications. The current treatment for type 1 diabetes requires a\n      life-long dependency on daily insulin injections, causing inconvenience and burden to\n      patients. Drug-induced hypoglycemia is also common as it presents a major challenge in\n      insulin therapy. Furthermore, although insulin therapy is lifesaving, it is not a cure as it\n      neither reverses the progression of the disease nor prevents the development of serious\n      complications associated with this disease. New treatments are urgently needed.\n\n      Recent studies have demonstrated that a natural chemical found in the brain,\n      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is also produced in large quantities by pancreatic\n      beta-cells, has beta-cell regenerative and immunoregulatory effects. Importantly, GABA\n      prevented and partially reversed diabetes in type 1 diabetes mouse models. It is important\n      to address essential questions regarding the potential effects of GABA in diabetic patients\n      in humans. Given the largely unknown mechanism of action of GABA in the pancreas, and the\n      limited information on how GABA is absorbed, distributed and eliminated from the human body,\n      we plan to examine these issues (referred to as pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) in normal\n      subjects.\n\n      The outcome of this study will provide useful information on the mechanism of action of GABA\n      in human subjects."
