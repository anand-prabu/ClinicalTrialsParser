  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the 19G and 25G needles for procuring tissue samples from the pancreas
      during Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) procedures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study compares the median number of passes to establish a definitive diagnosis using the
      19G or 25G needles. Also, the ability of both needles to procure a histological core tissue
      is assessed.
