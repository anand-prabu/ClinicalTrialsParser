            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them\n      or deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs\n      used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop\n      growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Donor stem\n      cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by radiolabeled\n      monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiolabeled monoclonal\n      antibody with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation followed by donor stem cell\n      transplantation in treating patients who have advanced acute myeloid leukemia."

Patients are stratified according to\n      available donor (related vs unrelated).\n\n      Patients receive a biodistribution dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 (I131 MOAB\n      BC8) IV, then a therapeutic dose of I131 MOAB BC8 IV 6-14 days later (day -12). Patients\n      undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -6 to -4. Patients receive\n      cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Bone marrow cells (or peripheral blood stem cells)\n      are infused on day 0.\n\n      Patients with CNS leukemic involvement receive intrathecal methotrexate twice before the\n      transplantation then every other week for 8 weeks beginning on day 32. These patients also\n      receive cranial irradiation beginning on day 32.\n\n      Cohorts of 4 patients each receive escalating doses of iodine I 131 attached to a standard\n      dose of monoclonal antibody BC8 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The\n      MTD is defined as the radiation dose preceding that at which 2 of up to 6 patients\n      experience graft failure.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 4 years."
