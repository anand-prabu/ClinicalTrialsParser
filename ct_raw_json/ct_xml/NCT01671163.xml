      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate placing the radiation therapy markers
      (Fiducial) by using an endoscopic procedure.  The endoscopic procedure is called an
      Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS).  This is a procedure using a special endoscope that has an
      ultrasound on the end.  The ultrasound will allow the doctor's to see where the radiation
      therapy markers (Fiducial) is to be placed as outlined by the Radiation Oncologist.

    <description>The outcome measure for this study is to determine:
The successful delivery, to the targeted tissue,of the fiducials through the fiducial delivery system,
The accuracy of the fiducial delivery into the targeted tissue and
to see if the fiducials can be visualized via Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS), Fluoroscopy and/or CT scan.
The success and accuracy of the delivery will be evaluated by Endoscopic Ultrasound, fluoroscopy and/or CT scan to determine if the fiducials are in the targeted tissue.  The subject's Oncologist will inform the endoscopist of the targeted tissue that is to receive the fiducials.</description>
