  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to assess the
      safety and tolerability of 100 mg and 200 mg of inhaled Alpha-1 HC administered once a day
      for three weeks in subjects aged 18 years and older with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The
      treatment duration in this study is intended to provide multi-dose safety information prior
      to proceeding to longer durations of exposure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documentation of CF diagnosis

          -  Have a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 40% of predicted at Visit 1 and have a Visit 2
             pre-investigational product FEV1 that is ≥ 40% of predicted and within ± 15% of the
             Visit 1 result.

          -  Deemed by the Investigator to be a suitable candidate for serial  collection of
             expectorated sputum.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had a pulmonary exacerbation during the 4 weeks before screening (Visit 1) which
             required the initiation of new antibiotic treatment

          -  Have a pulmonary exacerbation during the screening period (between Visit 1 and Visit
             2) which requires the initiation of new antibiotic treatment

          -  FEV1 &lt; 0.59 liters at the screening visit

          -  Respiratory insufficiency with continuous supplemental oxygen therapy, or carbon
             dioxide retention

          -  Elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that is &gt;/= 3
             times the upper limit of normal for age and gender

          -  Smoking during the past 6 months

          -  Lung surgery during the past 2 years

          -  Positive culture for Burkholderia cepacia or mycobacterium during the past two years.

          -  Active allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

          -  Pre-treatment sputum collection at Visit 1 or Visit 2 (Randomization) characterized
             by problems such as inadequate sputum volume or quality.

          -  Known selective Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency with known antibody against IgA
             (anti-IgA antibody).

          -  History of anaphylaxis or severe systemic response to any plasma-derived
             alpha1-proteinase inhibitor preparation or other blood product(s), or to
             polysorbates.

          -  Use of chronic, high dose ibuprofen therapy within 3 weeks of screening and at
             anytime during the study.

          -  Chronic maintenance therapy with systemic antibiotics within 3 weeks of screening and
             through last dose of investigational product.

          -  Use of leukotriene synthesis inhibitor (zileuton) or leukotriene receptor antagonists
             (montelukast, zafirlukast) within 3 weeks of screening and at anytime during the
             study.

          -  Use of roflumilast within 3 weeks of screening and at anytime during the study.

          -  Initiation of a new chronic medication or dosage change of a chronic medication for
             treatment of cystic fibrosis (example:  Kalydeco™ [ivacaftor]) within 3 weeks of
             screening (Visit 1).
