Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-14\n      months."
