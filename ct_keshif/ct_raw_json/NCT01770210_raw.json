            "textblock": "In western societies hypercholesterolemia is one of the major and independent factors that\n      predispose to cardiovascular disease and death from them. According to the clinical study\n      ATTICA, conducted during the years 2001-2002, in which randomized 1514 men and 1528 women,\n      rates of hypercholesterolemia observed in a sample of urban population was 39% for men and\n      37% women . The prevalence in the corresponding U.S. epidemiological study NIANES was 52%\n      for men and 49% women. The relationship between cholesterol, lipid-lowering therapy and risk\n      of cardiovascular disease appears to be quite clear in the secondary prevention trials, the\n      4S (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study), CARE (Cholesterol And Recurrent Events) and\n      LIPID (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease) which showed the\n      benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease. Despite these\n      remarkable results, studies were secondary prevention as a major shortcoming, the lack of\n      patients with acute coronary events. This gap came to cover the study MIRACL (Myocardial\n      Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering). In MIRACL study , atorvastatin 80\n      mg was evaluated in 3,086 patients (atorvastatin n = 1.538, placebo n = 1.548), acute\n      coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction without Q-wave or unstable angina). Treatment was\n      initiated during the acute phase after hospital admission and lasted for a period of 16\n      weeks. Treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg / day increased the latency of the combined primary\n      endpoint, defined as death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated\n      cardiac arrest, or angina with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia requiring admission\n      to hospital, indicating a risk reduction of 16% (p = 0,048). This was mainly due to a 26%\n      reduction in re-hospitalization for angina with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia.\n      The other secondary endpoints were not statistically significant by themselves (total:\n      placebo: 22.2%, Atorvastatin: 22.4%).\n\n      Statins by reducing coronary syndromes, it appears that contribute to reducing the incidence\n      of cardiovascular diseases. This is exactly what was observed in 4S, in which the incidence\n      of chronic heart failure (CHF) during follow-up was 10.3% for those who received placebo and\n      8.3% in the simvastatin group, a finding which translates 19% reduction in heart failure (P\n      <0,015) nationwide with the appearance episode (event) CV."

For this reason, a careful family history taking physical examination.\n      The Reynolds Risk Score may reclassify their low-risk patients at higher risk individuals.\n\n      Persons moderate risk This group includes mostly middle-aged people. The Framingham Risk\n      Score shows 10-19% chance of cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years.

The administration of lipid-lowering therapy in people with levels of\n      LDL-CHOL 100-129 mg / dL is recommended for people with multiple cardiometabolic risk\n      factors (visceral obesity, prediabetes, hypertension, etc.). The increase of atheromatic\n      index (> 5) and the presence of high (> 2 mg / L) levels of CRP (if available) are also\n      indications for lipid lowering regardless of the levels of LDL-CHOL.\n\n      Major risk factors: age> 45 years (men),> 55 years (women), positive family history of\n      premature cardiovascular disease [in the presence of major vascular events in first degree\n      relatives <55 years (men), <65 years (women)], hypertension , HDL-CHOL <40 mg / dL, smoking.\n\n      Individuals at high risk The Framingham Risk Score shows> 20% chance of cardiovascular\n      disease over the next 10 years.

Repeat determination of these parameters in patients who achieved their goals of\n      treatment 2 times a year or when changing the therapeutic regimen. Repeat laboratory tests\n      (lipid control effectiveness and liver enzymes and CPK for security control) after 12 weeks:\n      a reason to discontinue treatment if ALT> 3 times the upper normal range or CPK> 5 times the\n      upper normal range or in patients with myalgias. It should be noted that not necessitate\n      interruption of treatment with statins or deferral of treatment in individuals with small\n      increases in transaminases or CPK, while in these patients should be seeking other\n      underlying causes of elevated liver and muscle enzymes. The choice of drug and dosage depend\n      on the percentage change in HDL-CHOL necessary to achieve the objectives. Statins are\n      usually the evening before bedtime the night. The lipid-lowering therapy is therapy for\n      life, and most importantly, the patient adherence to treatment. It should be noted that\n      doubling the dose of a statin results in additional reduction of HDL-CHOL (LDL) cholesterol\n      by 6%.\n\n      The main goal of treatment is to reduce HDL-CHOL\n\n      The non HDL-CHOL (= T-CHOL - HDL-CHOL), proposed as a secondary target of lipid lowering\n      mainly in people with high triglycerides. The target for the non HDL-CHOL is 30 mg / dL\n      higher than the target for the HDL-CHOL. The decrease in triglycerides (<150 mg / dL) and\n      increased HDL-CHOL (> 40 mg / dL for men and> 50 mg / dL for women) is considered desirable\n      targets mainly lipid lowering in diabetic patients and in patients with cardiometabolic risk\n      factors. Has also been suggested as a target of treatment to reduce the atheromatous index\n      (T-CHOL/HDL-CHOL <4).\n\n      Atorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol,\n      LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglycerides in adults, adolescents and children aged\n      10 years and older with primary hypercholesterolaemia, including heterozygous familial\n      hypercholesterolaemia combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia (type IIa and IIv by Fredrickson),\n      when response to diet and other nonpharmacological measures is inadequate.\n\n      Atorvastatin is also indicated to reduce total cholesterol and LDL - cholesterol in adults\n      with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering\n      treatments (eg LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable.\n\n      Is also used to prevent cardiovascular events in adult patients who are thought to have a\n      high risk for a first cardiovascular event, as an adjunct to correction of other risk\n      factors.\n\n      Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme\n      responsible for the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a\n      precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. The triglycerides and cholesterol in the liver\n      are incorporated into very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and released into the plasma for\n      delivery to peripheral tissues. The low density lipoprotein (LDL) is formed from VLDL and is\n      catabolized primarily through receptor high affinity to LDL (LDL receptor).\n\n      Atorvastatin lowers cholesterol levels and lipoprotein plasma inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase\n      and then the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the liver and increase the number of LDL\n      receptors on the surface of liver cells which uptake and catabolism of LDL. Atorvastatin\n      reduces LDL production and the number of particles of LDL. H atorvastatin causes profound\n      and sustained increase of LDL receptor activity, in combination with a beneficial change in\n      the quality of the circulating particles of LDL. Atorvastatin effectively reduces LDL-C in\n      patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a group of patients who do not\n      usually respond to lipid-lowering medicines.\n\n      Atorvastatin in a dose-response study, was shown to reduce the concentration of T-CHOL (30%\n      - 46%), the LDL-CHOL (41% - 61%), apolipoprotein B (34% - 50%) and triglycerides (14% - 33%)\n      while producing variable increases HDL-CHOL and apolipoprotein A1. These results are so\n      consistent in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, non-familial forms\n      of hypercholesterolemia and mixed hyperlipidemia, including patients with\n      noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\n      It has been found that the decrease of the values \u200b\u200bof total cholesterol, LDL-CHOL and\n      apolipoprotein B reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality thereof."
