    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrapleural dornase
      alfa and tPA administered to patients with clinical failure of small-bore chest tube with
      persistent pleural effusions or malignancy-related loculated effusion to improve pleural
      drainage.

          7. At least 2 days from administration of chemotherapy

          8. At least 7 days from prior major surgery

          9. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not
             surgically sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method
             (abstinence, oral contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the
             study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug, and must have a negative
             urine or serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this
             trial.

         10. Patient judged to be 'medically stable' by primary investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment with intrapleural fibrinolytic agents

          2. Presence of any intracranial mass

          3. Traumatic hemorrhagic pleural effusion

          4. Major hemorrhage, coincidental stroke, or major trauma

          5. High-risk for systemic bleeding

             plan and follow-up requirements.

         11. Concurrent severe illness such as active infection, or psychiatric illness/social

         12. Patients who are pregnant or lactating (females of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to participation in this study)

         13. Expected survival less than six weeks
