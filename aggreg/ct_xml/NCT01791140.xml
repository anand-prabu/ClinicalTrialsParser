  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Avastin (bevacizumab) in
      combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in elderly patients (&gt;/= 65 years of
      age) with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients will be followed until
      disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, discontinuation of physician-patient
      relationship or study closure, whichever comes first.
