  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will evaluate the long-term benefits, optimal dose and mechanisms
      of mirror therapy and its effects on physiological markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to examine whether (1) the immediate effects of treatment intensity in MT
      would occur on sensorimotor impairments and functional performance in patients with subacute
      stroke; (2) the long-term benefits of treatment intensity in MT on functionality can persist
      for six months after treatment finished; and (3) the MT could result in cortical/movement
      reorganization as well as the changes in physiological markers.

    <time_frame>Baseline, change from baseline in FMA at 2 weeks, and change from baseline in FMA at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The UE subscale of the FMA (max. score 66) uses a 3-point ordinal scale to assess motor impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, change of ARAT at 2 weeks, and change of ARAT at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>ARAT will be used to assess the motor function of UE. A total of 19 items are to test the movement of grasp, grip, pinch, and gross motor, with a scale of 0-3 for each item (maximal of 57).</description>

    <measure>Motor Activity Log (MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change of MAL at 2 weeks, and change of MAL at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The MAL is a semi-structured interview of patients to assess the amount of use (AOU) and quality of movement (QOM) of the affected upper extremity in 30 important daily activities using a 6-point ordinal scale. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>ABILHAND questionnaire is an inventory of 56 manual activities that uses a 3-point ordinal scale to measure subjectively perceived difficulty in performing everyday bimanual activity.</description>

    <measure>Adelaide Activities Profile (AAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change of AAP at 2 weeks, and change of AAP at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>AAP will be applied to indicate the level of participation in household and community activities. This profile includes 21 activities in the four areas: domestic chores, household maintenance, service to others, and social activities.</description>
