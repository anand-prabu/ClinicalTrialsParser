The study will used specialized\n      catheters to measure pressure and volume.  The measure of pressure and volume leads to more\n      detailed analysis of heart function.  Patients will receive either sugar pill or sildenafil\n      prior to catheterization.  It is believed that sildenafil will improve relaxation and\n      contraction of the heart."
