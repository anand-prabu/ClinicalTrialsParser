Unit of randomization: Primary Health Care Centers (PHCC). Intention to treat\n      analysis. STUDY POPULATION: Motivated young smokers of 10 or more cigarettes per day aged 18\n      to 30 years consulting for any reason to PHCC and who provided written informed consent to\n      participate in the trial.\n\n      INTERVENTION: 6-month implementation of recommendations of a Clinical Practice Guideline\n      smoking cessation which includes mobile APPs application. Control group: usual care. OUTCOME\n      MEASURES: Abstinence at 12 months confirmed by exhaled air carbon monoxide concentration of\n      less or iqual 10 parts per million in each control.\n\n      RESULTS: The application of a smoking cessation intervention with a mobile APPs application\n      will improve the smoking cessation success rate in smokers, besides of their intention or\n      not to give up smoking at baseline."
