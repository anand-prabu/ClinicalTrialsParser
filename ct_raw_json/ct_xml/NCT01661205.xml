  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and technical feasibility of treating
      subjects with Persistent Atrial Fibrillation or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
      in a minimally invasive thoracoscopic ablation procedure utilizing the AtriCure Bipolar
      System, with mapping and additional lesion creation/ gap closure (as needed)   provided by
      currently approved catheter technology, when the epicardial and endocardial phases are
      performed in a staged manner within 1-10 days apart, during the same hospitalization.

      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate how safe a less invasive cardiac
      surgery using the AtriCure Bipolar System in conjunction with a catheter ablation procedure
      performed approximately 1-10 days after, in treating atrial fibrillation, and how effective
      is this staged procedure.  The AtriCure Bipolar System will be used to perform the less
      invasive cardiac surgery and a standard electrophysiology catheter, currently available,
      will be used to perform the catheter ablation procedure. This surgical procedure is
      considered less invasive because it is done through tiny surgical punctures on the sides of
      the chest near the ribs instead of one large surgical incision of the breast bone to
      completely open the chest and access the heart, and it also avoids the need for the
      heart-lung bypass machine.
