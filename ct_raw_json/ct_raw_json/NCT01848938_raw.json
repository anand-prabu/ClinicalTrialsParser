            "textblock": "Female urinary incontinence is very common and affects up to one fourth of grownup women. It\n      may reduce quality of life for those affected and costs for society are high. The most\n      common type of urinary incontinence is stress urinary incontinence (SUI), i.e leakage when\n      coughing, sneezing or jumping.\n\n      The recommended first line treatment is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)which leads to\n      improvement or cure in two-thirds of patients.  In addition, life style changes, such as\n      weight loss when obese, smoking cessation and reduction of fluid intake if high is\n      recommended.\n\n      There is a need for new , flexible and easily accessible treatment programmes for female\n      urinary incontinence. In our previous study, we compared two treatment programmes for SUI\n      without face-to-face contact: one internet based and one sent by post, both based on three\n      months of PFMT. In this randomized controlled trial of 250 women aged 18-70 years, we found\n      highly significant improvements (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (>0,8)concerning primary\n      outcomes (symptoms and quality of life scores) but no significant differences between\n      groups. Compared with the postal group, more participants in the internet group perceived\n      they were much or very much improved (40.9% vs 26.5%, p<0.01, reported reduced usage of\n      incontinence aids (59.5% vs 41.4%, p=0.02) and were satisfied with the treatment programme\n      (84.8% vs 62.9%, p<0.001).\n\n      The selling of smartphones is increasing rapidly. About 75% of all cellphones sold in Sweden\n      today are smartphones. Two million adults in Sweden have a smartphone.  Many smartphone\n      owners have at least one health app on their phone. Exercise, diet, and weight apps are the\n      most popular types.\n\n      From our previous experience of an Internet-based programme, we have developed a treatment\n      program designed for smartphone. The effect of the treatment programme will be evaluated\n      after three months by comparing the effect in the \"smartphone group\" with the effect in the\n      \"waiting group\".\n\n      Participants are consecutively recruited through our website. They answer an online\n      screening survey with automated immediated response for initial screening of eligibility\n      criteria. Informed consent and leakage diary (number of episodes of urinary leakage during\n      48 hours) are sent by post. After that, they answer a web questionnaire and finally they are\n      interviewed by a researcher to confirm the diagnosis SUI and to ascertain that the patient\n      is well informed of the study procedure.\n\n      Women are then randomized to either of the two groups. Women in the smartphone group get a\n      smartphone application for iphone or android. Follow-up after three months with a web\n      questionnaire and a leakage diary. After that the waiting group get their smartphone\n      application.\n\n      We aim to recruit 120 women aged 18 and older via our website www.t\u00e4t.nu. In the power\n      calculation we assume that the improvement in the symptom score (ICIQ UI SF) and the QOL\n      score (ICIQ luts QOL)in the smartphone group will be similar to the improvement we found in\n      the postal group in our previous study. We also assume that the waiting group will improve\n      in some extent.\n\n      To detect a difference between groups, power 80%, 2-side test and significance 0,05, group\n      size as follow\n\n      ICIQ UI SF smartphone group improves 2.9 (SD3,1) and waiting group 1,0 (SD2,0); 30 in each\n      group\n\n      ICIQ luts QOL Smartphone group improves 4.6 (SD6,7) and waiting group 2.0(SD3.0), 35 in each\n      group\n\n      PGI (patient\u00b4s global impression of improvement). 26,5% improves much or very much\n      (smartphone) and 4% (waiting group):39 in each group\n\n      We expect a drop out rate of 33% and thus need approximately 120 persons, 60 in each group."
