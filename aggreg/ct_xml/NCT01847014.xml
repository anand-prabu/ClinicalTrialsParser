      SYMPHONY Extension is an extension of AC-055-401, a multi-center, open-label, single-arm,
      Phase 3b study of macitentan in patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension to
      psychometrically validate the PAH-SYMPACT instrument. The objective is to assess the
      long-term safety of macitentan in subjects with PAH beyond the treatment in the AC-055-401
