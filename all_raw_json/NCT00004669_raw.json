Estimate the effect of cortisol replacement therapy on the signs of acute adrenal\n      insufficiency.\n\n      III.  Evaluate the effects of cortisol replacement therapy on adrenal hormone concentrations\n      and on the ability of the adrenal gland to respond to ACTH.\n\n      IV.  Determine the effect of this replacement therapy on markers of inflammation in lung\n      lavage fluid and peripheral blood leukocytes."

Hydrocortisone is given at 2-4 times the basal cortisol\n      secretion rate.\n\n      Tracheal lavage on intubated babies is performed at start of study and on day 4 of life to\n      assess concentrations of inflammatory markers.\n\n      If larger babies show appropriate response to ACTH by 15-17 days and the less mature babies\n      show a decreased response, then a longer course of therapy is proposed for future studies."
