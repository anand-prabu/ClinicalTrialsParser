  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, single  arm, and observational and multicenter study to
      assess the correlation between PEST and SCORAD scores in the management of AD with the
      Ceradan® regimen.

    <textblock>
      All eligible patients shall apply permitted topical steroid(s) according to standard local
      practice

      For the entire study period, patients should apply Ceradan Cream® liberally twice daily or
      more, if required and use a non-soap based wash once or twice daily.

      At the screening visit, patients will receive a diary card and will be asked to track their
      atopic dermatitis symptoms for 12 weeks.

      Retrospective information on other topical treatments used will be collected at baseline.
