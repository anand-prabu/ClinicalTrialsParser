  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to find a marker expression that the investigators can use to
      trace symptom progression and develop a more efficient therapy to enhance ARDS patient
      survival rate and better post-ICU life quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will first identify acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients
      receiving ECMO support in ICU at National Taiwan University Hospital, and then collect
      blood, urine and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples at different time points:
      before setting up ECMO, 2, 6, 12, 24, 72 hours,5 and 14 days after ECMO installment, time to
      wean ECMO and the day removing ECMO and leaving ICU. From the samples, the free radicals,
      cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18,tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β),
      and inflammasome- related markers, immune cell responses and other biochemical markers would
      be measured. The novel biomarkers to predict the outcome of the patient will be identified.
