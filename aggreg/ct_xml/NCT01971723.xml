  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that high amounts of total serum testosterone levels correlate with
      higher lean body mass, lowered fat mass, greater muscle strength, and faster recovery. These
      suggestions drive athletes and body builders to find ways to raise their testosterone
      levels. Many athletes and bodybuilders look to alternative methods to anabolic steroids in
      order increase their testosterone levels without legal repercussions or physiological side
      effects. Herbs and other plant extracts have been introduced as a possible source to
      naturally boost testosterone levels. Research supporting the use of herbs and plant extracts
      has been shown to be equivocal. However, evidence in studies with hypogonadal men suggests
      that longjack root may naturally boost testosterone levels. (Tambi M.I. et al).

      Onnit Labs, LLC has packaged this supplement (T+) which claims it can naturally boost
      testosterone and lower estrogen levels and subsequently improve performance. This product is
      a powder (11g) that is mixed with 16 oz of water and consumed 20 minutes prior to anaerobic
      workouts, such as high intensity weight training.

      T+ is a multi-ingredient supplement that consists of vitamins B5 and B6, magnesium aspartic
      acid, mucuna pruriens, longjack root, nettle root, red clover luteolin, resveratrol, beta-
      alanine, branch chain amino acids, L- glutamine, Bioperine, and Fibersol 2.

      The active ingredients purported to boost plasma testosterone levels are mucuna pruriens,
      longjack root, and magnesium aspartic acid. The active ingredients claimed to lower plasma
      estrogen concentrations are red clover, luteolin, resveratrol and nettle root. All other
      ingredients (Branch Chain Amino Acids and Beta-Alanine) have been documented to improve
      exercise performance.

      It is hypothesized that there will not be any physiological changes after supplementation of
      T+. It is also hypothesized that performance will not be affected by the supplementation of
      T+.

    <description>Measurement of one repetition maximums strength for all competition lifts included in a standard, ungeared, powerlifting competition (squat, bench and deadlift). This testing will take place before the supplementation of either T+ or placebo and at the end of the four-week training period. During the four weeks, the volume ((weight x reps)set 1+(weight x reps)set 2+ (weight x reps)set 3â€¦.. ) will be calculated and measured for each exercise in each lifting session.</description>

    <description>Randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind protocol with two treatment groups (matched by lean body mass). Group 1 will receive the recommended serving of one scoop (11g) of T+ supplement. This serving will be taken 45 minutes before the beginning of working out on an empty stomach (&gt;1 hour after meal). On non-training days, the participants will also take a serving at the same time as on training days. This will continue for four weeks (28 days).</description>
