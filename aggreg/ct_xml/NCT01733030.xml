      PROJECT SUMMARY:

      PTSD is a debilitating psychiatric condition precipitated by exposure to extreme, or life
      threatening, trauma with an estimated lifetime prevalence between 8% and 9% in U.S. adults.
      One core symptom of PTSD is intense psychological distress in the presence of stimuli that
      &quot;resemble&quot; one or more aspects of the trauma experience (DSM-IV).  This phenomenon referred
      to as stimulus generalization has received surprisingly little empirical testing in the
      context of clinical anxiety in general, and PTSD more specifically. The current proposal
      represents the first effort to study the neurobiology and pharmacology of this PTSD-relevant
      learning phenomenon across those with and without PTSD. The objective of this particular
      proposal is to apply fMRI and pharmacologic methods to: 1) identify brain mechanisms
      associated with generalization of conditioned fear and 2) examine the pharmacologic
      modifiability of levels of generalization using a partial agonist at the NMDA receptor
      complex (D-cycloserine) shown to increase discrimination of CS+ (danger cue) and CS- (safety
      cue) in animal studies.

      To fullfill the objectives of this application, a generalization paradigm has been designed
      and psychophysiologically validated in which 6 rings presented on a computer screen
      gradually increase in size. For half of participants the smallest ring is the conditioned
      stimulus paired with electric shock (CS+) and the largest is the unpaired stimulus (CS-),
      and for the other half of participants this is reversed. Activity in fear-related brain
      structures measured via fMRI are predicted to gradually decrease as the presented stimulus
      gradually becomes less similar to the CS+, forming a generalization slope or gradient. One
      central hypothesis of the current application is that DCS (Seromycin) will dose dependently
      increase the steepness of generalization gradients (i.e., reduce fear generalization). This
      study will include 3 groups of healthy adults recieving either 1) 500 mg Seromycin, 2) 250
      mg Seromycin, or placebo only prior to acquisition of fear conditioning. Twenty four hours
      later, participants will return to complete an fMRI during which brain responses to the
      danger cue and stimuli resembling the danger cue will be assessed.
