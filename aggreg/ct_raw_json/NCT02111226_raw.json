            "textblock": "Heart disease and stroke are the number one killers world-wide. When someone has\n      hypertension, the constantly elevated blood pressure damages their blood vessels and the\n      organs that they supply blood to. This causes stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney\n      failure and dementia. Finding and lowering high blood pressure to normal with lifestyle\n      changes and if necessary medications, lowers the risk of these outcomes. Canada has high\n      rates of blood pressure control compared to other countries in the world, due in large part\n      to the successful dissemination of hypertension guidelines. However remote and disadvantaged\n      communities have not been as successful and need additional measures to help achieve the\n      same level of blood pressure control as the rest of the country. The DREAM-GLOBAL team has\n      extensive experience working with Canada's Aboriginal Communities and a large community in\n      Tanzania. The DREAM-GLOBAL project will integrate innovations in technology with the\n      implementation of guidelines-based blood pressure control and through partnerships with\n      experts in government and industry, overcome barriers to lowering blood pressure in Canada's\n      Aboriginal Communities, and in a community in Tanzania. Tools will be developed and tested\n      that will close the circle of care around people with hypertension by bringing measurement\n      data to the medical record and health care provider and also sending useful medical feedback\n      to the person with hypertension via secure data servers and routine SMS messaging on cell\n      phones. The system will be tested for effectiveness of diagnosing and also for managing\n      hypertension. To begin the process of preventing hypertension, the team will also explore\n      with an Aboriginal community how to create policies to reduce the sodium content in their\n      food. If proven effective,  DREAM-GLOBAL can also become a platform for managing other\n      chronic diseases."
