  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fear, whether it occurs in humans suffering from an anxiety disorder or in experimental
      models with rodents, is reduced by exposing the frightened organism to the fearful stimulus
      in the absence of any negative consequences (i.e., extinction, or exposure therapy).
      However, fear often renews when the feared stimulus is encountered in a context different
      from the exposure context. In rats, the investigators found that interfering with the
      animal's ability to process contexts during extinction by administering an anticholinergic
      drug prevented fear renewal. This proposal will determine if the beneficial effect of this
      drug translates to exposure therapy in socially anxious humans. To this end, 100 individuals
      with Social Phobia who fear public speaking will undergo repeated sessions of exposure to
      public speaking, within a virtual reality context. Participants will be randomized to either
      drug placebo, .2mg/.01 mL Scopolamine, .3mg/.01 mL Scopolamine or .4mg/.01 mL Scopolamine,
      administered via nasal drops, prior to each session of exposure therapy. One month after
      completion of exposure therapy, context renewal will be tested by comparing physiological
      and subjective responses to public speaking in the same virtual context as used during
      exposure therapy versus a context different than the one used during exposure therapy. The
      goal is to identify the dose of Scopolamine associated with the greatest reduction in
      context renewal. In addition, a secondary analysis will attempt to identify those
      individuals who benefit most from Scopolamine-augmentation of exposure therapy.
