      This study will test the safety and tolerability of ISIS-SMNRx administered into the spinal
      fluid as a single injection in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, who previously
      participated in ISIS 396443-CS2 or ISIS 396443-CS10.

      This study will test the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      ISIS-SMNRx administered as an intrathecal injection. The single dose will be studied in
      patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, who previously participated in ISIS 396443-CS2 or
      ISIS 396443-CS10, and all patients will receive active drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical signs attributable to Spinal Muscular Atrophy

          -  Satisfactory completion of dosing and all study visits in ISIS 396443-CS2 or ISIS
             396443 CS10 with an acceptable safety profile, per Investigator judgement.

          -  Able to complete all study procedures, measurements and visits and parent/patient has
             adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 2 years from Screening

          -  Meets age-appropriate institutional criteria for use of anesthesia/sedation, if use
             is planned for study procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any new or worsening of existing condition which in the opinion of the
             Investigator would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere
             with the subject participating in or completing the study.

          -  Dosing in ISIS 396443-CS2 or ISIS 396443-CS10 within 180 days (6 months) of
             screening, or longer ago than 396 days (13 months) from screening

          -  Hospitalization for surgery (i.e. scoliosis surgery) or pulmonary event within 2
             months of screening or planned during the duration of the study

          -  Presence of an untreated or inadequately treated active infection requiring systemic
             antiviral or antimicrobial therapy

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug, biological agent, or device within
             1-month of Screening or 5 half-lives of study agent, whichever is longer.  Any
             history of gene therapy or cell transplantation.
