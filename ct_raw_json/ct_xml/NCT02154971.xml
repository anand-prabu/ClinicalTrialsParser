  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ageing process is known to be accelerated in HIV-infected patients, compared to the
      general population.

      Normal age-related hearing loss (presbyacusia) is a frequent phenomenon, affecting more than
      70% of people above 65 years. It is believed to be mostly the consequence of a mitochondrial
      damage caused by oxidative stress.

      Risk factors for accelerated age-related hearing loss are present in many HIV-infected
      patients :  chronic inflammation, smoking, diabetes, etc.

      The global aim is to measure the prevalence of presbyacusia in a well controlled HIV
      positive population in France, and to compare it to HIV negative controls matched for age
      and sex.

      70 HIV positive patients and 70 age- and sex- matched HIV negative controls will undergo a
      screening for presbyacusia (pure-tone, speech and evoked-response audiometry).

      We expect to find an increased prevalence of presbyacusia in HIV-infected patients, as
      compared to controls matched for age and sex.
