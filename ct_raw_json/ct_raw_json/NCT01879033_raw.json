National Health and\n      Nutrition Examination Survey data shows a 3-fold increase in the prevalence of obesity in\n      childhood, over past few decades. Furthermore, childhood obesity has markedly contributed to\n      the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in U.S. children. Alarmingly,\n      there is increasing evidence that atherosclerosis develops silently during childhood in\n      obese children. In the Bogalusa Heart Study, pediatric autopsy studies showed a clear\n      relationship between the number and severity of risk factors, principally obesity, with\n      atherosclerosis in both the aorta and coronary arteries. Increased intimal medial thickness\n      (IMT) was not present among obese adults who had been normal weight as children, emphasizing\n      the cumulative effects of childhood obesity persisting into adulthood. Thus, the need for\n      primary prevention of cardiovascular disease beginning in childhood is strongly suggested."

Pulse\n      volume is measured by a finger plethysmographic device that allows isolated detection of\n      pulsatile arterial volume changes, which are sensed by a pressure transducer and transferred\n      to a computer where the signal is amplified, displayed and stored (EndoPAT, Itamar Medical).\n      Studies are performed with the patient at rest, in a comfortable, thermo neutral\n      environment.  Fingertip probes are placed on the index finger of both hands and 5 minutes of\n      baseline recording are obtained.  Blood flow is then occluded in one arm for 5 minutes,\n      using a standard blood pressure cuff.  Recording continues in both fingers during occlusion\n      and for 5 minutes after release of the cuff.  The RH-PAT index is calculated as the ratio of\n      the average pulse amplitude in the post-hyperemic phase divided by the average baseline\n      amplitude, with normalization to the signal in the control arm to compensate for any\n      systemic changes."
