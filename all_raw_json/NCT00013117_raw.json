Several studies support the role for specialists and their specific\n      knowledge and expertise in a variety of disorders including diabetes.

A secondary goal of the project was to\n      better characterize the consultation process.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Patients with diabetes mellitus are complex and may benefit from the input of multiple\n      specialists and PCPs must determine the need for and coordinate the input from those\n      multiple specialists. With that in mind, the three objectives of the study are: 1) To assess\n      the impact of computer-assisted access to specialist expertise (CASE) on process of care for\n      patients with diabetes mellitus; 2) To assess the impact of CASE on outcomes of care at the\n      patient level (clinical outcomes and satisfaction),  provider level (satisfaction) and the\n      system level (health services utilization and costs); and 3) To characterize the\n      consultation-referral process in community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Randomized controlled trial with access to the CASE system constituting the intervention and\n      a descriptive study of the consultation process. The major outcome variables will be the\n      consultation type, adherence to diabetes practice guidelines, clinical outcome of diabetes\n      care (glycemic control), patient and provider satisfaction.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Project work has been completed. The final report has been submitted."
