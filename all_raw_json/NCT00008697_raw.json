Patients may receive up to 3 courses of treatment.\n\n      Dose escalation continues in cohorts of 3-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\n      or minimum effective dose (MED) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that\n      at which 2 or more patients experience dose limiting toxicity. The MED is defined as the\n      dose at which 4 of 6 patients achieve a complete cytogenetic or molecular response. After\n      the MTD or MED is determined, an additional 20 patients are enrolled at this dose level.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and every three months for an additional 1.5\n      years."
