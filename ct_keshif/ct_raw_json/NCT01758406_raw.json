Heart\n      transplantation is the ultimate approach to treating heart failure, but this is costly and\n      excludes patients who are poor candidates for transplantation given their co morbidities, or\n      for whom a donor organ is unavailable. Currently, there is no effective intervention to\n      regenerate dead heart muscle after a heart attack. Our hypothesis is that CSCs regenerates\n      myocardium. In this study all eligible patients are randomly allocated into two study groups\n      by a permuted block randomization method: group A (case group) received 5-10 millions\n      autologous cardiac stem cells, group B (control group) just received placebo. They follow up\n      for 18 months."
