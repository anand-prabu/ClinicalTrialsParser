  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only limited information on the process of completing long-term opiate substitution
      treatment (OST) with substances like methadone exist. Furthermore, systematic knowledge from
      scientific studies is scarce, there are only few studies with respect to treatment
      completion or regular termination (mainly catamnestic analyses). Studies by Nordt et al.
      (2004) or Nordt &amp; Stohler (2006) show an estimated rate of 10% of patients per year who
      terminate OST by means of tapering the substitution agent or changing into withdrawal
      treatment in specialized clinics. It is state of the art that an indication for termination
      of OST has to be based on a common agreement between the patient and the doctor.
      Furthermore, the patient should live in a stable social situation and the state of health
      had markedly improved. Finally, the patient has to be free of (illegal) drug use for at
      least 6 months and the individual aims of treatment should have been reached (Vader et al.
      2003).

      The main objective of the prospective and explorative study is the systematic description of
      the process of termination of OST. With a comparison between patients who complete OST
      regularly and patients who terminate treatment prematurely (or are still in treatment)
      predictors of positive termination of OST can be identified.

      Patients treated with methadone or levomethadone of 5 general practitioners' practices and 2
      specialized clinics who might be able to terminate OST during the next 12 months from the
      doctors' perspective can take part in the study. In addition to baseline examination further
      assessments take place every 3 months (i.e. after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). The questionnaires
      include state of health, well-being, social situation as well as drug and alcohol use.
      Furthermore, the treating doctors are asked every 3 months to fill out questionnaires on
      infections and other disorders, clinical characteristics, dosage process and drug use
      (measured by urine samples).

      Patients who will be successful in completing OST during the observational period will be
      compared with the remaining cases.

      Finally, a 6-month follow-up is planned in order to investigate the stability and
      maintenance of the situation at month 12.
