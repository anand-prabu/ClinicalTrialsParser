The primary hypothesis is that home blood\n      pressure telemonitoring supplemented with individualized, culturally tailored\n      telephone-based nurse case management will have greater effects on blood pressure reduction\n      and stroke recurrence and, while it will be more costly, it will also be more cost-effective\n      than home blood pressure telemonitoring alone. Results of this study will provide strong\n      empirical evidence to inform clinical guidelines and practice, which may lead to reductions\n      in stroke disparities in the United States."
