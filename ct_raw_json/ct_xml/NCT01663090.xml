      This research study is a pilot study to evaluate a new contrast agent, ferumoxytol, for the
      purpose of imaging lymph node metastases in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. This contrast
      agent is an investigational drug. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being
      studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that
      the FDA has not approved ferumoxytol for this use. This drug has been used to image adults
      with other forms of cancer, however, it has only been used to image a small number of
      pediatric patients. Ferumoxytol has never been used to image sarcoma.

      Before the research starts you will undergo some screening procedures to confirm that you
      are eligible to participate in the study. These include a medical history, blood tests and
      an electrocardiogram.

      After we confirm taht you are eligible for this study you will undergo the following. We
      estimate that you will be on the study for approximately two to three weeks.

      Baseline MRI of the tumor site and draining lymph nodes: Whether you are on the study or not
      you will have a baseline MRI which involves the use of a standard contrast agent called
      gadolinium. This imaging test is considered the standard of care and is the method by which
      doctors determine tumor location and spread. This MRI is NOT part of the study.

      Ferumoxytol Infusion: You will receive this study drug the same day as your baseline MRI; if
      you already had your baseline MRI, this medication can be given intravenously (i.e. directly
      into the vein) at your next clinical visit. It can likewise be given through a central line.
      You will be observed during the infusion and 30 minutes after the infusion to ensure that
      you do not have an allergic or adverse reaction to the medication.

      Repeat MRI of the tumor site and draining lymph nodes: Three to five days after receiving
      ferumoxytol, you will undergo a repeat MRI. You will not require any additional contrast
      prior to this imaging study. This MRI is part of the study.

      Lymph Node Biopsy: You will be undergoing a lymph node biopsy whether or not you are on the
      study. This will occur approximately a week after your study MRI. This is a surgical
      procedure that involves removing one or a few lymph nodes in the region of your tumor and
      studying them under a microscope to determine whether they contain signs of microscopic
      cancer spread. Your surgeon will explain this procedure to you in more detail.

      We anticipate that your clinic visit for ferumoxytol will take approximately an hour. MRI
      tests, on average, likewise take approximately an hour to complete.

      After you have completed the study MRI and lymph node biopsy, you will require one
      additional blood test to measure blood iron levels. We measure iron levels because
      ferumoxytol is comprised of an iron core. This iron is similar to that in oral iron
      supplements and can cause your blood iron levels to temporarily increase. Because we are
      trying to determine whether this contrast agent will be useful, you will not receive teh
      results to the study MRI. If however, lymph nodes are found to be positive for disease, your
      treatment plan may change to address this.

    <description>The safety of ferumoxytol in pediatric patients will be assessed by the proportion of patients who experience at least one dose limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT refers to toxicities experienced after the start of the drug infusion; they are based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the sensitivity of conventional MRI in detecting the presence of lymph node abnormalities in pediatric and adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma, and to compare this to the sensitivity of nanoparticle-enhanced MRI. The sensitivity of nanoparticle-enhanced MRI will be descriptively compared to the sensitivity of conventional MRI, where in each case the histological confirmation of lymph node involvement is the &quot;standard of truth.&quot;  For conventional MRI, sensitivity will be measured by the number of patients in whom at least one lymph node abnormality was detected by conventional MRI, as determined by the primary radiologist, divided by the total number of evaluable patients.</description>
