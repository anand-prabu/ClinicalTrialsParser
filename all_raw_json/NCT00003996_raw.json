Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme."

Evaluate the efficacy of carmustine, cisplatin, and etoposide administered\n      prior to and during radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioblastoma\n      multiforme. II. Assess the toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient population.\n      III. Assess fatigue, depression, and excessive daytime somnolence in terms of incidence,\n      duration, and relation to age, tumor type, tumor site, cancer therapy, and symptoms in this\n      patient population. IV. Evaluate the quality of life of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive pre-irradiation chemotherapy consisting of carmustine IV over 1\n      hour on days 1-3 and oral etoposide on days 1-21 and 29-49 immediately followed by cisplatin\n      IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 and 29-31. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 2 courses.\n      Patients receive concurrent cranial radiotherapy daily over 8 weeks during course 2.\n      Patients then receive carmustine IV over 1-2 hours every 8 weeks for 4 courses. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is\n      assessed before the study, prior to each treatment course, every 4 months for 1 year, every\n      6 months for 4 years, and then annually for 5 years. Patients are followed every 4 months\n      for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, annually for 5 years, and then for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months."
