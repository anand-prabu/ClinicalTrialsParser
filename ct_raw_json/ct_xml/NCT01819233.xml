  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies caloric restriction in patients with stage 0-I breast
      cancer during surgery and radiation therapy. Reducing caloric intake may prevent disease
      progression in patients with breast cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to
      kill tumor cells. Giving dietary intervention and radiation therapy together may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        1. Investigate the feasibility of a clinical trial administering ionizing radiation with
           concurrent caloric restriction (CR) for the treatment of breast cancer.

           SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        2. Investigate measurable changes of patient characteristics and tissue and serum from CR
           conditions to determine a metric for evaluating this treatment in future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 2-4 weeks after completion of lumpectomy, patients receive food diaries to
      complete for 7-10 days. Dietary counselors then give patients guidelines for dietary
      modifications to reduce caloric intake by 25% of their normal diet. Patients follow caloric
      restricted diet for 10 weeks (2 weeks prior to radiation therapy, during 6 weeks of
      radiation therapy, and at least 2 weeks after radiation therapy). Patients undergo radiation
      therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week for 6 weeks.
