  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VA community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) typically serve only a small number of women
      Veterans, and generally do not have the women's health care resources that are available in
      larger settings. Women Veterans using these sites for primary care must sometimes travel to
      other sites to receive women's health care. That can create travel burdens, reduce
      continuity of care, and negatively affect patient outcomes. To address this, VA is
      implementing a clinical operations innovation that supports women's primary care providers
      with a technology-based intervention that combines interactive communication with women's
      health specialists and ongoing education.  This research study is evaluating the
      implementation and effects of this women's healthcare delivery innovation.  Findings from
      this research will inform VA women's health clinical practice and education, and will
      advance science in delivering technology-supported non-face-to-face care that is applicable
      to other clinical conditions and patient populations.

      Project Background/Rationale: Women Veterans are a rapidly growing proportion of VA
      patients.  While entitled to receive care equivalent to their male counterparts, women
      Veterans may receive lower quality care, in part due to a VA primary care (PC) workforce
      that has limited experience caring for women, particularly their gender-specific conditions.
      This workforce may be especially challenged in community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs),
      where access to women's health (WH) expertise may not be readily available.  CBOC PC
      providers (PCPs) typically have small caseloads of women Veterans, making it difficult for
      these providers to maintain their WH knowledge and skills. To ensure quality care for women
      Veterans, VA mandated designated WH providers (DWHPs) in every VA facility, and instituted
      intensive training opportunities-&quot;WH mini-residencies&quot;-for these providers.  Although highly
      valuable in delivering a standard level of specialized WH training, these one-time trainings
      are not sufficient, as knowledge attenuates over time. Serial education re-enforcement over
      time is needed to produce and maintain long-term gains in knowledge. Furthermore, additional
      supports, such as enhanced communication between PCPs and specialists, are necessary to
      achieve and sustain quality gains.  To address these issues, VA is implementing a clinical
      operations innovation that is designed to improve CBOC-based DWHP delivery of comprehensive
      WH care. This innovation (entitled DWHP Support) combines: 1) advanced WH serial
      patient-based education that exposes DWHPs, over time, to a depth and breadth of WH cases
      and issues (SCAN-ECHO); and 2) interactive communication between CBOC DWHPs and VA Medical
      Center-based specialists for &quot;just in time&quot; support of DWHP WH care (electronic
      consultations).  The intervention is technology-supported and delivered virtually. It is
      being implemented in a stepwise manner.

      Objectives:  Facilitators and barriers to use of DWHP Support, and its effect on patient
      management are unknown.  The investigators hypothesize that DWHP Support will improve the
      quality and efficiency of WH care in CBOCs. The specific aims are:

      Aim #1: To evaluate the effect of DWHP Support on WH care quality and efficiency, using a
      modified stepped wedge design within VISN 22; Aim #2: To explore the impact of DWHP Support
      in changing DWHP behavior and self-rated WH knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy; Aim #3: To
      assess attitudes about DWHP Support and its use, specialist time for its implementation, and
      other features that could influence DWHP Support's effectiveness, sustainability and spread;
      Aim #4: To develop tools to measure quality of WH care in VA.

      Methods: The investigators will conduct an observational study of DWHP Support for CBOC
      DWHPs. The investigators will use a mixed methods analytic approach (combining a modified
      stepped wedge quantitative analysis with provider surveys and interviews) to measure the
      intervention's effect after 1 year, while also evaluating the implementation process and use
      of the intervention. The investigators will use quality assessment methods to translate
      existing evidence-based WH performance guidelines into quality measurement tools applicable
      to VA WH care.

      Anticipated Impact: This proposal aims to evaluate an innovation to improve WH care in CBOCs
      that uses a technology-based educational and interactive communication intervention designed
      for WH providers.  To measure the intervention's effectiveness, this project will develop WH
      quality measures that will be valuable tools for other VA efforts to improve WH care. The
      findings on effectiveness and implementation could influence VA's approach and use of
      technology-supported interventions for other clinical conditions and in other special
      populations.
