Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of\n      cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin in treating patients with intermediate or\n      high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed following or are resistant to\n      anthracycline-containing primary combination chemotherapy."

Determine the efficacy of high-dose cyclophosphamide/etoposide/cisplatin in\n      patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed primary\n      combination chemotherapy but still respond to conventional-dose DHAP\n      (dexamethasone/cytarabine/cisplatin) and are not candidates for bone marrow transplantation.\n      II. Determine the toxicity of the intensification chemotherapy regimen in this group of\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. CVP: Cyclophosphamide, CTX,\n      NSC-26271; Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If at least 1 CR is seen in the first 6 patients, an estimated maximum of\n      20 patients will be enrolled. If 3 or more of the first 10 patients (or 25% of the study\n      population thereafter) die within the first 35 days of treatment from causes unrelated to\n      tumor progression, the study will be terminated."
