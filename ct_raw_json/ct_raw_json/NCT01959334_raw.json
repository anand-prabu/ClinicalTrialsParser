In their\n      recommendations, both transient and persistent antibody responses should be combined to\n      determine the overall immunogenicity of a product in a given condition. In particular,\n      persistent antibodies are of high importance, since patients with persistent antibodies are\n      more likely to experience clinical sequelae in terms of safety and efficacy, while a\n      transient antibody response can resolve without further consequence.\n\n      The present study will provide information on immunogenicity of AMG504-1 with regards to the\n      potential development of high antibody titers or neutralizing antibody activity which may\n      lead to loss of efficacy or an increased risk of an adverse reaction."

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated\n      single doses of glucagon following intranasal (IN) and intramuscular (IM) administration in\n      adults with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (T1D or T2D).  The secondary objective is to evaluate\n      the safety and tolerability of glucagon following IN and IM administration in adults with\n      T1D or T2D. A total of seventy-five (75) adult patients with T1D or T2D will be included in\n      the study.\n\n      Male and female patients of at least 18 years of age but not older than 70 years with a\n      history of type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes of at least 2 years duration, and with a body\n      mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 18.5 and below or equal to 35 kg/m2 will be\n      selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will be in general good\n      health, without late severe complications, according to medical history, physical\n      examination (including vital signs), nasal examination, bilateral anterior rhinoscopy and\n      laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology, urinalysis) including negative screening of\n      ethanol and drugs of abuse in urine. A 12-lead ECG will be performed. For female patients, a\n      HCG beta serum pregnancy test must be negative.\n\n      A single dose of glucagon will be administered in the morning after a 10-hour overnight\n      fast, either by intranasal or intramuscular route, on 3 occasions.  The random allocation of\n      each treatment to each subject will be generated using a 2:1 stratification.\n\n      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through the assessment of adverse events, clinical\n      and laboratory examinations.\n\n      Descriptive statistics comprising the sample size, mean, median, SD and 95% confidence\n      intervals (CI) of the mean will be used to describe the titer of anti-glucagon antibodies in\n      each treatment group by period. In addition, the number, proportion and associated 95% CI of\n      patients in each treatment group with anti-glucagon antibodies above the limit of detection\n      will be described."
