  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding under vitamin K antagonists  are a major iatrogenic causes of hospitalization,
      subject to a fatal outcome in more than one third of cases, mortality is particularly high
      in cases of serious bleeding, including intracerebral hemorrhage. If the INR measured in
      these patients are often away from the higher value of the target range, a significant
      proportion of bleeding were observed for INR between 2 and 3. The study captures the
      components of the nutritional status of patients on oral anticoagulants, including any
      micronutrient deficiencies, to determine whether nutritional status is an independent risk
      factor for bleeding

      Be included in this study patients under anti-vitamin K supported or followed the emergency
      department Adults.

      The inclusion visit will be conducted in the emergency department Adults Clermont-Ferrand by
      an emergency physician or investigator or co-investigator. The protocol will be explained to
      patients in detail, the information document and consent will be issued for playback, then
      they will be asked to sign the consent form and participation agreement.

      Case-control study: patients under oral anticoagulant with severe hemorrhagic accident
      compared with patients without hemorrhagic accident. Cases will be matched to controls based
      on age, sex, and the value of the INR.

      Patients will be divided into two groups:

        -  Group 1: cases Patient under anti-vitamin K with a serious bleeding event that required
           treatment in the emergency Adults. Is considered serious accident requiring the use of
           a reversion by PPSB (Kaskadil ®).

        -  Group 2: contols Patient under anti-vitamin K with no haemorrhagic manifestations
           admitted for another reason to Emergency Adults

      Each case will be paired with two controls
