            "textblock": "Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of acute cardiac events -\n      specifically, identification of the roles that arterial vasomotor dysfunction and autonomic\n      nervous system imbalances play in the pathophysiologic cascade during such acute events -\n      provides a platform for new mechanistic investigation of the interplay of psychosomatic\n      stress and CHD (coronary heart disease).  Preliminary evidence further suggests that\n      Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practices, such as the Transcendental\n      Meditation (TM) technique, can not only reduce stress but also reduce acute cardiac events\n      in patients with CHD.  Based on these and related data, we propose a randomized, blinded,\n      controlled study of the effects of one CAM practice, the TM technique, compared to a control\n      group, on the primary outcomes of (1) arterial vasomotor dysfunction (brachial artery\n      reactivity); (2) autonomic nervous system imbalances (heart rate variability); (3) transient\n      myocardial ischemia (ST-segment depression); and (4) the secondary outcomes of psychological\n      stress and quality of life (anger, hostility, anxiety, depression, perceived health,\n      disease-specific symptoms, and life stress/social resources)."
