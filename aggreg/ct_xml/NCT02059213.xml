  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effect of adding the drug PD 0332991 to CAD (Combined Androgen
      Deprivation) therapy in patients with RB (Retinoblastoma Protein) positive hormone sensitive
      prostate cancer.

      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of PD 0332991 to initial ADT (Androgen
      Deprivation Therapy)  in patients with newly metastatic RB-positive prostate cancer may
      significantly increase the efficacy of ADT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have pathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer.

          -  Have hormone-sensitive metastatic disease (M1) as evidenced by soft tissue and/or
             bony metastases prior to initiation of androgen deprivation therapy.

          -  Patients must have a minimum PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) ≥ 5 ng/mL obtained
             within 60 days prior to study registration.

          -  Agree to undergo a biopsy of at least one metastatic site for RB (Retinoblastoma
             Protein) status evaluation.  Adequate metastatic tissue from prior biopsy/resection
             can be used if available in lieu of a biopsy.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring system
             used to quantify general well-being and activities of daily life; scores range from 0
             to 5 where 0 represents perfect health and 5 represents death).

          -  Patients may have received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant hormonal therapy, for
             non-metastatic disease but it must not have lasted for more than 36 months. At least
             12 months must have elapsed since completion of androgen deprivation therapy in the
             neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting, and serum testosterone must be within the
             institutional normal range.

          -  Within 14 days prior to registration patients must have adequate organ and marrow
             function:  White Blood Cell (WBC) count ≥ 3,000/μl, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥
             1,500/μl, Platelet Count ≥ 100,000/μl, Serum Creatinine ≥1.5 x the institutional
             upper limits of normal or corrected creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mg/ml/hr/1.73 m2 BSA
             (Body Surface Area), Bilirubin within the institutional limits of normal, AST
             (Aspartate Aminotransferase) ≤ 2 x upper limits of normal, ALT (Alanine
             Aminotransferase) ≤ 2 x upper limits of normal.

          -  Patients must be able to take oral medication without crushing, dissolving or chewing
             tablets.

          -  Patients may have received prior radiation therapy or surgery. However, at least 14
             days must have elapsed since completion of radiation therapy or surgery and patient
             must have only grade 2 or less adverse effects at the time of registration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             that is approved by an institutional review board.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received androgen deprivation therapy within the past 12 months
             prior to enrollment are not eligible for this study.

          -  Patients who are currently being treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.,
             amprenavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir,
             mibefradil, miconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir,
             telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil, voriconazole, and grapefruit) or strong
             inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, felbamate, nevirapine, phenobarbital, phenytoin,
             primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine and St. John's wort) must either
             discontinue these drugs or are ineligible.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III
             and IV heart failure), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers are not eligible. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot;
             malignancy if they have completed all therapy and are now considered without evidence
             of disease for 1 year.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible .
