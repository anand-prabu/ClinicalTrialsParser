This is a test of how bad a participant's psoriasis is. The scale combines redness, scaling, and thickness, as well as overall body involvement to determine the PASI score, scale ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst); and physician global assessment (PGA): The PGA is 6-point scale used in clinical trials of various diseases. In this the physician checks the state of the disease and gives them score from 0 (clear) to 5 (severe). Percentage of participants will be reported.",
