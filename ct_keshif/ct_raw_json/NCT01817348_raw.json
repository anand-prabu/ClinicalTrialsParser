Therapeutic exercise, especially stretch exercise and joint mobilization,  remain the\n           mainstay of conservative treatment of frozen shoulder.\n\n             1. Nevertheless, shoulder pain during the physiotherapy reduces the treatment effect.\n\n             2. Manipulation or arthroscopic release under general anesthesia may avoid pain\n                during the intervention; however, increased risk of humeral shaft fracture and\n                failure of release of pathological tissue were reported.\n\n        2. We consider intra-articular injection is a compromized way, from a practical point of\n           veiw, to reduce the pain during physiotherapy.\n\n        3. We hypothesize that, intra-articular injection with lidocaine before joint mobilization\n           and stretch exercise, can make the patient pain-free during physiotherapy, and the\n           effect of combined therapy is superior to physiotherapy alone in the treatment of\n           frozen shoulder."
