Hypertonic saline is a medicine that is\n      used to thin out secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis (and other conditions).  We\n      hypothesize that having children on a ventilator inhale this medication will shorten the\n      amount of time that they need to be on the ventilator."

            "textblock": "Recent pediatric data shows that less than 80% of children mechanically ventilated for \u2265 96\n      hours survived to PICU discharge, while 100% of children mechanically ventilated for < 96\n      hours survived to PICU discharge.  Interventions that decrease duration of mechanical\n      ventilation may improve outcome by limiting ventilator-induced lung injury, sedative\n      medication usage and ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Obstructive airway secretions may\n      prolong mechanical ventilation by causing atelectasis and endotracheal tube obstruction,\n      with resultant cardio-respiratory instability.  Nebulized hypertonic saline (HTS) is used to\n      decrease mucus viscosity and increase mucociliary clearance in patients with diseases such\n      as cystic fibrosis and bronchiolitis, and has been used to enhance airway clearance in\n      mechanically ventilated children.  Administering nebulized HTS to mechanically ventilated\n      children may facilitate airway clearance and shorten mechanical ventilation.\n\n      In a randomized study of children < 2 years old following cardiac surgery, patients given\n      dornase, another mucolytic agent, had a significantly decreased duration of mechanical\n      ventilation versus those given saline placebo (52 hrs vs. 82 hrs).  HTS may be even more\n      effective, as mechanically ventilated newborns with persistent atelectasis had more\n      improvement in radiographic findings and oxygen saturation when randomized to receive\n      hypertonic saline compared to those randomized to receive dornase.  This may be because\n      dornase may only be effective in patients with leukocytes or bacterial present in tracheal\n      aspirates, while HTS may be effective in all ventilated patients.  Further study of the\n      impact of prophylactic mucolytic therapy on the duration of mechanical ventilation in\n      children is warranted."
