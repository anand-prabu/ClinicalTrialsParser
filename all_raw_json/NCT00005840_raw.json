Patients also undergo whole abdominal radiotherapy for 5 consecutive days weekly for 6\n      weeks.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel and cisplatin until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is\n      determined, additional patients are treated at that dose level.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-48 patients will be accrued for part I and 14-20 patients\n      will be accrued for part II of this study."
