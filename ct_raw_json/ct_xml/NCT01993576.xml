      The purpose of this study is to determine if NIF fluoresent imaging is an effctive approch
      to detect the margine of the breast tumoral tissue.

      Primary objective:

      Definition of the histological distribution (intravascular, extra vascular, in specific
      cells) of ICG (pre-operatively intra-venously injected) at the level of tumoral and healthy
      tissues of breast cancer patients (and the potential of axillary lymph nodes found
      fluorescent).

      Secondary objectives:

      Evaluation of the ability of the fluorescence imaging to determine the tumor volume and,
      more specifically, the boundaries of tumor tissues which will be analyzed by the
      pathologist.

      Analysis of the correlation between fluorescence and &quot;margins&quot; as defined operatively as
      tumor (microscopically by the pathologist).
