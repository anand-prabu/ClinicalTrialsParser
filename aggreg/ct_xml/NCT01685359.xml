  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this trial is that the test drug (Human Recombiant Epoetin - Blau)
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters are similar to the comparator drug (Eprex ®
      -  Janssen-Cilag) in healthy subjects following administration of multiple intravenous dose.
      The objective of this randomized, parallel, clinical trial is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the test drug Human Reconbiant Epoetin
      produced by Blau Farmacêutica, compared to the comparator drug Eprex®, produced by
      Janssen-Cilag, by assessing plasma concentration of the drug and the reticulocyte count
      following a multiple intravenous administration during 4 weeks of 100 IU/kg in healthy
      subjects.
