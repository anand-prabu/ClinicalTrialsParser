Using leuvectin to deliver this gene may be an effective\n      treatment for prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of leuvectin followed by surgery in\n      treating patients who have stage II or stage III prostate cancer."

Between days 8 and 14,\n      patients undergo retropubic prostatectomy.\n\n      All patients are followed at 2 months. Patients with a PSA no greater than 0.2 ng/mL are\n      followed at 4 months and 6 months, every 3 months for 12 months, and then every 6 months for\n      3.5 years in the absence of disease progression or biochemical failure.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
