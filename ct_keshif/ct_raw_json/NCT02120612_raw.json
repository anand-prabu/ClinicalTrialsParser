The aim is to measure whether education influences patient behavior. Finally, all\n      subjects will be administered an empirically-validated measure to assess subject shame and\n      guilt (i.e. Guilt and Shame Proneness Scale; GASP), and response patterns in their behavior,\n      to evaluate whether shame and guilt predict behavior at follow-up. The investigators will\n      compare to data (i.e. OOKS, GASP, and History Survey) from a historical control group prior\n      to the implementation of the educational program - and, also at 1-3 month follow-up."
