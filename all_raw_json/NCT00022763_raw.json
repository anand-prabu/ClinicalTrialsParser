Simultaneous to initiating T-20, all patients\n      begin a \"new\" optimized antiretroviral regimen based on the patients' prior treatment\n      history, historical resistance testing results, and the results of the testing performed at\n      screening. Patients are followed for safety and other assessments at Weeks 1, 2, and 4, then\n      monthly through Week 24 and bimonthly through Week 48.
