      Background:

      - Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a genetic disorder of the lymph system.
      People with ALPS often have swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck and armpit. They
      also have a much higher risk of developing lymphoma. It is not always easy to determine
      whether the swollen lymph nodes are caused by ALPS or by lymphoma. Researchers want to see
      whether different imaging studies can show the difference between ALPS and lymphoma. The
      studies used will be positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT).
      Researchers will use a drug called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to look at the lymph nodes.

      Objectives:

      - To see how well imaging studies can distinguish between swollen lymph nodes caused by ALPS
      or by lymphoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals must be 5 years of age or older and enrolled on the National Institutes of
           Health natural history study of ALPS.

        -  Participants should either have lymphoma or have symptoms that suggest possible
           lymphoma.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will have an FDG-PET/CT scan. It will be performed according to standard
           procedures.

        -  If the results of the scan do not show lymphoma, participants will stay on the study
           for 1 year for clinical follow up. They may have a second FDG-PET/CT scan if there is a
           change in symptoms. Such changes include further enlargement of lymph nodes,
           unexplained fevers, or weight loss.

        -  If the results of the scan show evidence of new or worsening lymphoma, treatment on
           this study will end. Further tests based on clinical symptoms, including a lymph node
           biopsy, may be done under the ALPS natural history study to rule out or make a
           diagnosis of lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      The Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited disorder associated with
      defective lymphocyte apoptosis, which is clinically characterized by prominent nonmalignant
      lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and overt autoimmune diseases such as hemolytic anemia,
      autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Additionally, ALPS patients have a
      significantly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma
      (HL). The diagnosis of lymphoma is particularly troublesome in ALPS because many ALPS
      manifestations overlap with clinical features suggestive of lymphoma. Therefore, individuals
      with ALPS may undergo repeated biopsies during the course of the disease. Fluorodeoxyglucose
      positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is a noninvasive
      test that may help us discriminate benign from malignant lymphadenopathy in patients with
      ALPS.

      For patients with ALPS and clinical symptoms suggestive of lymphoma, such as a sudden
      increase in focal lymphadenopathy and/or systemic B symptoms associated with lymphoma, we
      want to investigate whether FDG-PET/CT is useful in determining a plan of action by
      assisting in locating the most active lymph node and determining whether a surgical biopsy
      is warranted.  Under this protocol, FDG-PET/CT scans will be done to rule out lymphoma. A
      lymph node biopsy may be necessary to determine the pathology of the lymph node and will not
      be done for research purposes alone.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To qualify for enrollment, patients must meet all of the following:

          1. Fulfill current criteria for the diagnosis of ALPS, which includes documented chronic
             nonmalignant lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly, and either greater than or equal to
             1.5% T-cell receptor alpha/beta+ DNTs in the peripheral blood or confirmed RAS
             mutation with or without elevated alpha/beta DNTs.

          2. Be enrolled in ALPS natural history protocol #93-I-0063.

          3. Have 1 or more of the following:

               1. Sudden enlargement of at least 1 lymph node or group of lymph nodes over
                  baseline.

               2. Systemic symptoms suspicious for lymphoma (i.e., loss of weight, loss of
                  appetite, fatigue, night sweats, fever, and pruritus).

               3. A histologically proven diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

          4. Be 5 years of age or older.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded if any of the following is present:

          1. Concurrent proven infection or inflammatory disease (e.g., sarcoidosis), which itself
             often shows increased FDG uptake by PET and which could interfere with the
             interpretation of study results.

          2. Hyperglycemia (regardless of etiology) determined by fasting glucose of &gt; 200 mg/dL

          3. Weight in excess of 400 lb, which will exceed the weight limit for the scanner table.

          4. Pregnancy or breast-feeding. For women of childbearing potential, a negative urine or
             serum pregnancy test is required within 24 hours prior to an FDG-PET/CT scan.
