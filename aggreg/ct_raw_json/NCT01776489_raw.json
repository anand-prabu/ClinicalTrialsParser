In this population adverse reactions against food\n      compounds can lead to anaphylactic reactions. Despite substantial research efforts, clinical\n      markers predicting disease severity and symptoms are missing to date.\n\n      Recent studies have revealed that sphingolipids, especially sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P),\n      play an essential role in allergy. It was reported that asthmatic patients have higher S1P\n      levels in bronchiallavage fluids after allergen challenge. First experimental studies\n      revealed a correlation of S1P and the outcome of anaphylaxis. Furthermore, we have shown in\n      our recent mouse study that S1P homeostasis is pivotal for food allergy induction and\n      effector cell response. Therefore, it is the aim of the presented pilot project to evaluate\n      whether S1P serum titers are altered in food allergic children and if the S1P levels\n      correlate with the outcome of anaphylaxis during double blind placebo controlled food\n      challenges (DBPCFCs)."
