The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for 4 years, and\n      then annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-38\n      months."
