We will take a two-part approach to analysis. First, we will treat it as a binary outcome, comparing the percentage of caregivers that missed at least one day of work during the 30-day follow-up period between the two study arms using logistic regression. Second, we will treat the number of days of work missed as a count outcome and use poisson regression to compare the two study arms. No interim analysis is planned.",
