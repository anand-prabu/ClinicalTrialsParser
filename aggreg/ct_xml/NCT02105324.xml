    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable automated bionic pancreas system that
      automatically delivers both insulin and glucagon can improve glycemic control vs. usual care
      for young people with type 1 diabetes ages 6-11 years old in a diabetes camp environment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Age 6-11 years with type 1 diabetes for at least one year

          -  Diabetes managed using an insulin infusion pump for ≥ three months

          -  Willing to wear two infusion sets and CGM sensor and change sets frequently (at least
             one new glucagon infusion set daily)

          -  Otherwise healthy (mild chronic disease such as asthma will be allowed if well
             controlled that do not require medications that result in exclusion)

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Unable to provide informed consent, informed assent or parental consent

          -  Unable to comply with study procedures

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the
             judgment of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or
             the safety of the subject

          -  End stage renal disease on dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis)

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG)

          -  History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia
             action of glucagon (e.g. liver failure or cirrhosis). Other liver disease (i.e.
             active hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver,
             hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes
             significant compromise to liver function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion

          -  Personal history of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, or other pancreatic disease,
             including pancreatic tumor or insulinoma

          -  History of prolonged QT or arrhythmia, congenital heart disease or current known
             cardiac disease

          -  Acute illness (other than non-vomiting viral illness) or exacerbation of chronic
             illness other than T1D at the time of the study

          -  Seizure disorder, history of any seizure within the last two years, or ongoing
             treatment with anticonvulsants

          -  Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness (indicators would include symptoms
             such as psychosis, hallucinations, mania, and any psychiatric hospitalization in the
             last year), or treatment with second generation anti-psychotic medications, which are
             known to affect glucose regulation.

          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might
             be susceptible to RF interference

          -  Use of oral (e.g. thiazolidinediones, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitinides, DPP-4
             inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) anti-diabetic medications

          -  History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and
             vomiting.

          -  Unwilling or unable to completely avoid acetaminophen during the comparator and
             bionic pancreas arms of the study

          -  History of eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia, or diabulemia or omission of
             insulin to manipulate weight

          -  History of intentional, inappropriate administration of insulin leading to severe
             hypoglycemia requiring treatment

          -  Any factors that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would interfere with
             the safe completion of the study procedures
