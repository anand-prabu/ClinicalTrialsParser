Compare the efficacy and safety of oral granisetron versus placebo in\n      preventing nausea and vomiting during the 48 hours that begins 24 hours after administration\n      of cyclophosphamide-based or carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens in patients with\n      malignant disease.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel, multicenter\n      study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral\n      granisetron on day 0 at 60 minutes prior to the scheduled administration of IV\n      cyclophosphamide or carboplatin (or doxorubicin) chemotherapy. On days 1 and 2, patients\n      receive oral granisetron at approximately the same time as on day 0. Arm II: Patients\n      receive oral granisetron on day 0 as in arm I. On days 1 and 2, patients receive oral\n      placebo at approximately the same time as the granisetron tablets were taken on day 0.\n      Patients are followed between 5 and 11 days after the last dose of study medication.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 434 patients (217 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
