Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Sequential dose escalation of epirubicin is followed by sequential dose escalation of\n      irinotecan. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of epirubicin and irinotecan\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
