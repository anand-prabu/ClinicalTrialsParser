      This trial will determine the safety and immune activity of HER-2 pulsed DC1 vaccine in
      patients with high risk HER-2pos breast cancer with residual disease post neoadjuvant
      therapy. Subjects will have estrogen independent stage I III breast cancer with residual
      disease in the breast or axillary nodes post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Mammogram, laboratory
      studies, CT, and leukapheresis will be performed, in addition to vaccine administration.
