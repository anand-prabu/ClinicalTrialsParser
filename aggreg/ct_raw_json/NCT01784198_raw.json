            "textblock": "Protein is an essential part of our diet. It is used to build muscle and body tissue, send\n      signals throughout our body and to support the immune system. Dietary protein is even more\n      crucial during pregnancy as it is needed for healthy growth and development of the baby.\n      There is very minimal data available on how much additional protein is required during\n      pregnancy. Current recommendations are based on older techniques such as nitrogen balance\n      studies of non-pregnant adults and minimally based on pregnancy specific data. There is no\n      scientific information regarding the amount of protein needed during different stages of\n      pregnancy.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the current recommendations of protein intake during\n      pregnancy are underestimated.\n\n      The goal of this study is to measure protein requirement in healthy pregnant women\n      (19-35y)using a more quick and modern technique called the indicator amino acid oxidation\n      technique (IAAO)."
