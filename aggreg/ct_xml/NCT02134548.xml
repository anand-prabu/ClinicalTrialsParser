    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site trial assessing the sensitivity of Chagas Detect™ Plus rapid test
      versus standard reference tests (e.g. IFA, IHA, RIPA) for Chagas diagnosis.

      The Chagas Detect™ Plus rapid test serves as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of
      Chagas infection in patients.  This test is intended to be used on human whole blood or
      serum samples. Chagas Detect™ Plus results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by
      testing with a reference standard test.

      Subjects will be patients at clinical sites located in Chagas-endemic areas. After informed
      consent is obtained and the subject is screened for eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will
      be collected. One is blood from finger prick, and the other is blood from venous puncture
      (drawn from vein in arm).

      Rapid tests and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory
      staff members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the
      samples from each method independently.

        Human males and females of varying ages and geographical locations where Chagas infection
        is endemic.  We will use retrospective (archived) and prospective human serum and blood
        samples.

        Retrospective (archived) serum samples are not collected specifically for this study and
        are not individually identifiable to the Investigators.   These samples will fall under
        the category of &quot;leftover&quot; specimens as described by FDA guidance.

        Prospective whole blood samples will be collected in compliance with human subject
        protection. The first sample will be collected from finger prick; the second sample will
        be collected from venous puncture.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All age groups and both sexes for archive samples, adults only and both sexes for
             prospective samples.

          -  Samples collected from subjects living in T. cruzi endemic regions.

          -  Information must be available about symptoms, age, and sex of patient from which
             samples are collected.

          -  The location of sample collection must be recorded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Archived samples with linked personal identifiers or any sample for which personal
             information can be discovered.

          -  Prospective samples from nursing home residents; inmates/subjects in police custody;
             participants who are unable to understand verbal or written local language in which a
             certified translation of the informed consent is available, or requires a Legal
             Authorized Representative (LAR) for consent.

          -  Subject serum specimens that have undergone more than 2 freeze-thaw cycles or that
             have not been stored frozen.
