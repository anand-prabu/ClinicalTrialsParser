The investigators want to observe\n      how the gums change shape with healing in two different scenarios:\n\n        1. If the soft tissue around your tooth is thin, following extraction and implant\n           placement an extra soft tissue graft (taken from your palate) in the area in order to\n           increase the thickness of your gums after healing.\n\n        2. If the soft tissue around your tooth is thick, the implant will be placed without a\n           soft tissue graft.\n\n      Previous studies have shown that both methods work and can give good results. In fact the\n      two methods are used routinely but they have never been compared objectively to one another\n      in the same research study.\n\n      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate if there is any difference in terms of\n      esthetic outcomes between these two treatment modalities after a crown has been placed on\n      the implant."
