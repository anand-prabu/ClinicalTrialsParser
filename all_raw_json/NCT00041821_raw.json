The investigators are interested in knowing whether age, gender, and allergy\n      status (nasal allergies) predict nasal irritant sensitivity.  This is important in\n      understanding symptom reporting patterns in air pollution situations (particularly in\n      so-called \"problem buildings\"), as well as in understanding the reflex mechanism of a\n      response of the nose to irritants (e.g., nasal congestion)."
