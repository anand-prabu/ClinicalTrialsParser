  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal maturity assessment, defined also as bone age (BA), has an important role in
      pediatrics and pediatric endocrinology, used mainly for evaluating growth and puberty
      related endocrine disorders. Repeated BA assessment is important during the follow up of
      children with short stature, with precocious puberty and those treated by growth promoting
      medications.

      The most commonly used method used for determining skeletal maturity, and thus BA is based
      on comparison of a hand and wrist radiographs to a standard series of representative films
      in the &quot;Radiographic atlas of skeletal development of the hand and wrist&quot; by Greulich and
      Pyle (GP), which has been issued several decades ago. The suggested method in this study is
      based on ultrasound technology, and therefore it is quick, objective, and radiation-free. It
      delivers an immediate non biased result without the need to rely on an observer's evaluation
      of the hand radiograph and without the need for a specialized radiology facility.

      Skeletal maturity assessment, defined also as bone age (BA), has an important role in
      pediatrics and pediatric endocrinology, used mainly for evaluating growth and puberty
      related endocrine disorders. Repeated BA assessment is important during the follow up of
      children with short stature, with precocious puberty and those treated by growth promoting
      medications.

      The most commonly used method used for determining skeletal maturity, and thus BA is based
      on comparison of a hand and wrist radiographs to a standard series of representative films
      in the &quot;Radiographic atlas of skeletal development of the hand and wrist&quot; by Greulich and
      Pyle (GP), which has been issued several decades ago. Among the disadvantages and drawbacks
      in this BA assessment method are: the obligatory need for using radiology units that are
      often available only in special facilities or hospitals, not available at the physicians
      office, the exposure to ionizing radiation, and the known limitation of the method for the
      need of an endocrinologist to assess the BA, with a known large inter observers variability
      of the BA interpretation.

      The suggested method in this study is based on ultrasound technology, and therefore it is
      quick, objective, and radiation-free. It delivers an immediate non biased result without the
      need to rely on an observer's evaluation of the hand radiograph and without the need for a
      specialized radiology facility.

      This technique was innovated in order to find an efficient, convenient and non radiation
      based method of skeletal maturity assessment for the primary care physician that can be
      performed in an office setting.

      The aim of this study is to establish a new bone age database by an ultrasound apparatus
      (SonicBone) that will eventually replace the X-ray based assessment using Greulich and Pyle
      and Tanner &amp; Whitehouse Atlas and methods.

      The design of the study is to perform a concomitant skeletal maturation assessment by
      reading of an ultrasound technique using the SonicBone apparatus. Skeletal maturation
      assessment will be performed in females and males at various age groups from 4-17 years old.

    <description>The aim of this phase is to collect the ultrasound reading values of Speed of Sound (SOS) and Distance (DIS) of all participants by performing a one time measurement of the left hand by the SonicBone's BA device. Each measurement will be performed on three sites of the hand:  the wrist the phalanx and the metacarpal bones.</description>

    <description>The device measure BA using ultrasound technology by measurement of speed of sound in three different sites : wrist bones, Phalanx III, Metacarpal bones.The device sends a short US pulse and measures the distance between a transmitter probe and a receiver probe, located at the bone measured area.The US probe converts electrical pulse to US pulse and US wave via tested bone arrives from transmitter to   Receiver.  Simultaneously with US pulse, controller start timer to calculate time between US pulse and the moment that US wave arrives to receiver. The accepted US signal of selected probe via amplifiers arrives to comparators that read timer value. The microcontroller calculates SOS using distance between probes and US time of flight.</description>
