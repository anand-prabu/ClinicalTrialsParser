For\n      cohorts 1 to 7, 8 subjects each will be enrolled, and subjects will be randomized such that\n      6 subjects will receive AMG 333 and 2 subjects will receive placebo (3:1 ratio). In cohort\n      8, up to 24 subjects with migraines will be enrolled, depending on enrollment rate and\n      emerging safety and tolerability data. These migraine subjects will be randomized to receive\n      AMG 333 or placebo in a crossover fashion. Both healthy and migraine subjects will be\n      monitored in house for 4 days then allowed to return home for the remainder of the 14 day\n      observation period.
