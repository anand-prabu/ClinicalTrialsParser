However, the effect of RGC on exercise\n      performance in humans had not yet been tested. A special population where increasing\n      performance is highly sought are competitive athletes. The aim of the current study is to\n      investigate the effect of RGC on measures of aerobic fitness, body composition and mood in\n      trained male cyclists"
