  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulation treatment (OAC) following clinically successful catheter abla-tion of
      atrial fibrillation (AF) is controversial. Recent guidelines recommended con-tinuation of
      OAC in all patients with CHA2DS2VASc score ≥2 even if there is no evidence of recurrent AF
      (Camm JA et al., Eur Heart J 2012). The net clinical ben-efit of OAC after successful
      ablation in these patients remains to some extent un-clear. As OAC bears the risk of
      bleeding events, the ODIn-AF study aims to evalu-ate the positive effect of OAC on the
      incidence of silent cerebral embolic events in patients with a high risk for embolic events,
      free from AF after successful pulmo-nary vein ablation. ODIn-AF aims to determine that
      continued administration of dabigatran is superior in the preven-tion of silent cerebral
      embolism to discontinuation of OAC after 3 months in pa-tients free from symptomatic
      AF-episodes with a CHA2DS2VASc score ≥2 after the first pulmonary vein ablation for
      paroxysmal AF.

For the following patients the recommended daily dose of Pradaxa is 220 mg taken as one 110 mg capsule twice daily:
Patients aged 75 years or above
Cr-Cl 30-50 ml/min
Patients who receive concomitant verapamil
For the following groups, the daily dose of Pradaxa of 300 mg or 220 mg should be selected based on an individual assessment of the thromboembolic risk and the risk of bleeding:
Patients with moderate renal impairment
Patients with gastritis, esophagitis or gastroesophageal reflux
Other patients at increased risk of bleeding</description>
