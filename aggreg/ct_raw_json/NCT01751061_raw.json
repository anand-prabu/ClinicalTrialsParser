To address this problem, we propose a randomized, controlled trial to determine\n      if an innovative web-based decision aid compared to usual care control can improve the\n      quality of decision making (defined as clinician-surrogate concordance for prognosis,\n      quality of communication, and medical comprehension), reduce surrogates' psychological\n      distress (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress syndrome disorder (PTSD) symptoms),\n      and reduce patients' health care costs over 6-month follow up.  We will enroll 410 surrogate\n      decision makers for 273 patients (expected average of 1.5 surrogates per patient).  This\n      study has the potential both to improve how clinicians and surrogates interact in intensive\n      care units and to increase the likelihood that life support decisions are aligned with\n      patients' values."
