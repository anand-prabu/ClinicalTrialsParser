II.\n      Characterized the plasma pharmacokinetics of this regimen in patients. III. Established the\n      ability of this regimen to improve the response rate to chemotherapy in patients who\n      relapsed on front-line therapy. IV. Evaluated the multidrug resistance profile of these\n      patients following this treatment regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This was a multicenter study. Stage I: Patients received VX-710 IV over 72 hours,\n      followed by doxorubicin IV and vincristine IV four hours after initial VX-710. Vincristine\n      was administered at half dose in the first 3-6 patients. If no more than 1 of 6 patients\n      experienced a dose limiting toxicity in the half dose cohort, 3 additional patients received\n      full dose vincristine. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experienced a dose limiting toxicity. Stage II: Patients received\n      VX-710 IV over 72 hours, followed by doxorubicin IV and full dose vincristine IV four hours\n      after initial VX-710. Treatment continued for up to 6 courses every 3 weeks in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were followed every 3 months for\n      up to 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 35 and a maximum of 92 patients was to be accrued for this\n      study."
