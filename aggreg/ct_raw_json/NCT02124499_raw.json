Whereas severe complications like cardiovascular events are rare,\n      postoperative side effects like nausea and vomiting, pain, long-lasting pain and\n      pain-related interference of daily activities are frequent. The question arises which\n      patient is at specific risk for these sequelae. Pre-existing predisposing factors (e.g.\n      patients' genetic background), surgery- and anesthesia-related variables (drugs, techniques\n      administered for anesthesia and analgesia) as well as psychological and social factors might\n      influence the outcome.\n\n      In this prospective association study these variables will be investigated in a\n      well-described patient cohort presenting for scheduled surgery.\n\n      Objective\n\n      The aim of this study is to associate perioperative and postoperative complications and side\n      effects as well as long-term outcome after surgery to patient- and surgery-related\n      variables, including genetic variants.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Prospective association study"
