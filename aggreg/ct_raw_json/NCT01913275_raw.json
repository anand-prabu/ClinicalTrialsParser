            "textblock": "Hypothesis preoperative biliary decompression by Cholecystojejunostomy will reduce infective\n      complication by 23% as compared to endocopic stenting INTRODUCTION Pancreaticoduodenectomy\n      has been associated with a substantial postoperative morbidity and mortality. Advances in\n      surgical techniques and postoperative care have led to a decrease in the operative\n      mortality. However, the postoperative morbidity has remained high varying between 5%-64%.1\n      Of the various risk factors, analyzed in the retrospective studies, the degree of jaundice\n      as indicated by the serum bilirubin levels has been associated with an increased risk of\n      complications.2-5 Preoperative biliary drainage has been tried to decrease the serum\n      bilirubin levels and consequently decrease postoperative morbidity and mortality. However,\n      its role remains controversial.\n\n      External biliary drainage using percutaneous transhepatic insertion of a catheter has been\n      used.6,7 The disadvantages of external bleary drainage include the risk of spontaneous\n      catheter dislodgement, inflammation and pain at the puncture site, leak of ascitic fluid and\n      bile around the catheter, and loss of fluid and electrolytes. Moreover, bile has an\n      antibacterial action and its loss has been associated with sepsis and renal failure. Hence,\n      internal biliary drainage is considered more appropriate.\n\n      Internal biliary drainage can be achieved by surgical cholecystojejunostomy or endoscopic\n      bile duct stenting. The internal drainage provides a more physiological route for drainage\n      of bile into duodenum or jejunum, which prevents any loss of electrolytes and bile salts,\n      and reduces the risk of endotoxemia. Two studies using endoscopic bilary drainage have shown\n      benefit in terms of reduced postoperative morbidity and mortality.7,8 However, it involves\n      the insertion of a foreign body (stent), which results in occurrence of bacteria in bile\n      with its attendant problems of postoperative sepsis.\n\n      Prior to the availability of the endoscopic and percutaneous methods, surgical bilioenteric\n      bypass was the only method for preoperative biliary decompression. The disadvantage of this\n      method is that it requires anesthesia and involves a surgical incision. However, its\n      advantages are that no foreign body is inserted into the biliary tree and hence the\n      likelihood of sepsis is low. Also, endoscopic stenting before pancreaticoduodenectomy may\n      result in difficulty while dissecting the common bile duct. Historically, Whipple conceived\n      pancreaticoduodenectomy as a two staged procedure. The first stage was surgical\n      decompression of biliary tract to reduce the level of the hyperbilirubinemia to minimize\n      mortality and morbidity after extirepative surgery and the second stage was a definitive\n      surgical resection.\n\n      There is no study comparing the outcomes of preoperative endoscopic and surgical drainage in\n      patients undergoing pancraticoduodenectomy. We plan to carry out a randomized trial\n      comparing the outcomes of preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage with surgical drainage in\n      patients undergoing pancraticoduodenectomy.\n\n      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\n      To compare endoscopic bilary stenting with cholecystojejunostomy as a preoperative biliary\n      drainage procedure in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with respect to\n\n        1. Technical success\n\n        2. Successful drainage\n\n        3. Procedural-related complications\n\n        4. Hospital stay\n\n        5. Intra-operative difficulty\n\n        6. Postoperative morbidity and mortality.\n\n      PATIENTS AND METHODS\n\n      All consecutive patients with surgical obstructive jaundice attending Gastrointestinal\n      surgery and medicine OPD at AIIMS will be evaluated with a detailed history and clinical\n      examination, liver function tests and an ultrasound abdomen. Those patients who have liver\n      function tests and an ultrasound suggestive of lower end block will be further evaluated\n      with a contrast enhanced CT and side viewing endoscopy (biopsy whenever possible) to\n      characterize the nature of block.\n\n      Inclusion criteria\n\n        1. Patients with periampullary carcinoma and carcinoma of the head of pancreas.\n\n        2. Patients with serum bilirubin >15mg/dl\n\n      Exclusion criteria\n\n        1. Patients with gastric outlet obstruction.\n\n        2. Patients with unresectable tumour assessed by imaging techniques.\n\n        3. Patients with a history of cholecystectomy and Billroth II gastrectomy.\n\n        4. Patients stented outside Study design the number of patients to be included was\n           calculated to be 67 in each group based on assumption that infective complications will\n           be reduced to 7%. the sample size was calculated with power of 90% and alpha error of\n           0.5 Patients will be randomly divided using sealed envelope method (using computer\n           generated random numbers) to two groups of 50patients each.\n\n      Group A: Endoscopic stenting Group B:  Cholecystojejunostomy\n\n      Preprocedural preparation10\n\n        1. Informed consent: The patient will be explained about the course and nature of disease,\n           alternatives methods of treatment available, outcome with and without treatment. The\n           procedure will be explained completely to the patient including the risks and\n           complications involved and then consent will be taken.\n\n        2. Investigations The following investigations will be done in all the patients\n\n             1. Prothrombin time\n\n             2. Liver function tests (LFTs)\n\n             3. Baseline haematological, biochemical and radiological investigations done in all\n                patients as follows:\n\n           i) Haemogram ii) Kidney Function Test iii) Electrolytes iv) Blood sugar v) Chest X-ray\n           vi) ECG\n\n        3. Prophylactic antibiotics: All patients will receive prophylactic antibiotics (Inj\n           cefaperazone + sulbactam 1 gm) 2 hours before the procedure and these will be continued\n           upto 72 hours after the procedure. Patients will be kept nil orally for 8 hours prior\n           to the procedure, and will be well hydrated with i.v. fluids.\n\n      Procedure\n\n        1. Endoscopic stenting (EBS)11 A therapeutic duodenoscope and a standard sphincterotome\n           will be used for canulation of the bile duct. A hydrophilic guidewire  (Terumo, 0.032\"\n           dia or Jag wire 0.035\" dia, microvasive) will be used to cross the malignant stricture.\n           After the stricture was crossed with the help of a guidewire, the wire will be removed\n           and bile will be aspirated. A small sphincterotomy will be done with a wire-guided\n           sphincterotome to facilitate the passage of the stent. The sphincterotome will be\n           removed and a guide catheter will be passed over the guidewire and then a 10 F 7 cm\n           long straight plastic stent will be inserted across the stricture over the guidewire. A\n           maximum of three attempts will be allowed for insertion of the stent after which it\n           will be categorized as procedural failure.\n\n        2. Cholecystojejunostomy (CJ) Cholecystojejunostomy will be done under local anesthesia\n           using a small subcostal incision made over the distended gall bladder. The anastomosis\n           will be done in 2 layers using 3-0 vicryl and 3-0 silk sutures.\n\n      Any complications related to both procedures and following them will be recorded.\n\n      Follow up On day 5 following the endoscopic or surgical bypass, the patients will be\n      reassessed clinically and with hematological and biochemical parameters with special\n      reference to haemogram and LFTs to know whether the biliary drainage is effective. After 4\n      weeks along with clinical, hematological and biochemical parameters, nutritional parameters\n      will also be assessed.\n\n      All patients will be considered for definitive procedure at least after 4 weeks after the\n      biliary drainage procedure.\n\n      The operative difficulty, amount of blood loss, number of transfusions required and\n      operative time during definitive surgery will be recorded. Following\n      pancreaticoduodenectomy, the postoperative complications will be evaluated in both groups.\n\n      Outcome measures Primary\n\n        1. Technical success: Passage of a stent across the stricture, along with flow of bile\n           through the stent.\n\n        2.
