            "textblock": "Not all pregnant women have the same risks for pregnancy complications. Women at low-risk\n      for pregnancy complications may not need the same type of prenatal care. The goal of this\n      study is to learn about the use of telemedicine for low-risk pregnant women and improve the\n      delivery of prenatal care. Telemedicine is medical care provided using a computer or\n      telephone to visit with a doctor for some medical appointments. Participating patients will\n      be assigned by a computer to either standard prenatal care, or prenatal care involving a\n      combination of standard prenatal visits and telemedicine visits. Both groups will have the\n      same number of prenatal care visits.\n\n      In both groups, we will ask about the patients' satisfaction with their care, the amount of\n      time they spent visiting with their doctor, and information about time and their expenses.\n      In the telemedicine group, we will teach how to measure blood pressure, fetal heart rate,\n      and weight from home.\n\n      The goals of this study are to: 1) assess the patient satisfaction, patient experiences and\n      preferences, financial impact, clinical outcomes, and provider satisfaction of providing\n      personalized prenatal care for low-risk pregnancies using telecommunication and remote\n      patient care devices; and 2) measure the reliability of at-home, patient-recorded,\n      computer-documented prenatal care measurements."

            "textblock": "Study procedures and data collection for a woman enrolled to the study are described below:\n\n        1. Randomization Prior to enrollment in the study, eligible participating patients will be\n           randomized into the control or remote prenatal care groups. The study coordinator will\n           be aware of which group the participant is assigned to and provide training tailored to\n           the assigned study group. The telemedicine group will receive all training described\n           below. The control group will only receive training on the survey instrument and\n           instruction on how to access the message box within MyChart.\n\n        2. Remote Monitoring Devices Remote prenatal care group participants will measure, record,\n           and submit their blood pressure, weight, and fetal heart recordings into MyChart\n           (described below) no more than 48 hours prior to a scheduled remote prenatal care visit\n           (described below).\n\n             -  Weight- Participants will use their home scale or be given one to use if they\n                don't have one. For demonstration purposes, a scale will be available during the\n                in-person visit with the study coordinator. The patient is required to measure\n                weight in pounds to the nearest pound.\n\n             -  Blood Pressure- Participants will be provided one digital blood pressure cuff that\n                will measure their blood pressure to be used throughout the pregnancy. They will\n                be required to report the systolic and diastolic blood pressure as measured and\n                displayed by the device in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).\n\n             -  Fetal Heart Rate- Participants will be provided one digital fetal doppler monitor\n                to be used throughout the pregnancy. They will use it to determine the fetus'\n                heart rate in beats per minute.\n\n           Patients will be allowed to keep the devices at the conclusion of the study as\n           compensation for participating and completing the research.\n\n        3. MyChart Epic MyChart is the personal health record that is linked to the Epic\n           electronic health record used by the University of Utah. Participants will use MyChart\n           to record information to allow their recordings to integrate within the Epic electronic\n           health record and be viewable by the treating clinician. At each time point that\n           requires patient recording of health data described above, patient-entered flowsheets\n           will be available with the required data fields. Help text will also be available on\n           the form to assist proper data entry. Automated data validity checking will assure data\n           are properly recorded.\n\n        4. Remote Prenatal Care Visit The remote prenatal care visit will be conducted at a\n           predetermined scheduled time using a web-based, Health Insurance Portability and\n           Accountability Act (HIPAA-compliant  video communication solution provided by the\n           University of Utah Department of Telemedicine. A message will be sent to the\n           participant within MyChart containing the video link and password prior to the meeting.\n           If the video solution does not work, is having difficulties, or if the patient does not\n           prefer using video, the prenatal care visit will be conducted by telephone.\n\n        5. Survey Instrument The survey instrument, built using REDCap, will be available\n           immediately following a scheduled visit. A link to the survey will be available in\n           MyChart as well as emailed to their message box within MyChart.  If the survey hasn't\n           been completed within 72 hours, the study coordinator will contact the participant to\n           remind them to complete the survey. Participants will have one week to complete the\n           survey."
