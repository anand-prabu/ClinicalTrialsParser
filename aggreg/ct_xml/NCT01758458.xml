    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best way to give laboratory treated
      autologous T cells together with aldesleukin and to see how well it works in treating
      patients with metastatic merkel cell carcinoma. Biological therapies, such as cellular
      adoptive immunotherapy, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor
      cells from growing. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill tumor cells.
      Giving cellular adoptive immunotherapy with aldesleukin may be a more effective treatment
      for metastatic merkel cell carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with treating patients with
      metastatic merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) by combined myosin heavy chain (MHC) up-regulation
      therapy and adoptive transfer of merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) T-antigen (TAg)-specific
      polyclonal autologous cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells.

      II. Determine the antitumor efficacy associated with treating patients with metastatic MCC
      by combined MHC up-regulation therapy and adoptive transfer of MCPyV TAg-specific polyclonal
      autologous CD8+ T cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the in vivo persistence and where evaluable, migration to tumor sites of
      adoptively transferred polyclonal CD8+ T cells targeting the MCPyV TAg.

      II. Determine the in vivo functional capacity of adoptively transferred polyclonal CD8+ T
      cells targeting the MCPyV TAg.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy or recombinant interferon beta intralesional injection
      within day -3 to day -1.

      Patients receive MCPyV TAg-specific polyclonal autologous CD8-positive T cell vaccine
      intravenously (IV) on day 1 and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) every 12 hours on days 1-14.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with continued presence of detectable metastatic disease 8 weeks after the first
      infusion may repeat the treatment regimen including radiation therapy or recombinant
      interferon beta injection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
