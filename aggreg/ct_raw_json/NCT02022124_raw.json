            "textblock": "Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a debilitating and costly condition that affects 1.2 million\n      Portuguese with an estimated cost in the United Stated of $50 billion.  Randomized\n      controlled trials has shown that placebo interventions can dramatically reduce chronic low\n      back pain and its associated disability.  Generally, it is assumed that response to placebo\n      requires concealment or deception, which presents a dilemma to the clinician.   In clinical\n      practice, how can patients benefit from an available, effective and potentially\n      cost-effective intervention without being deceived?  This study seeks to determine ethically\n      acceptable open-label placebo treatment (with full informed consent) can lead to meaningful\n      benefits.   The primary study will involve 80 patients with cLBP who will be randomly\n      assigned to a three-week course of either non-deceptive open-label placebo pills in the\n      context of a persuasive rationale + treatment as usual or to be continued on their\n      treatment-as-usual.   Primary outcome measures will be pain intensity and symptom\n      bothersomeness on the previous week.    Additionally, the study will investigate a possible\n      association between the genetic variation of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT\n      polymorphisms) with the hypothesized observed placebo effect on cLBP patients.\n      Participants will be followed for 3 weeks with a mid-point (11 days) visit. Patients who\n      receive only usual care for the first three weeks will be eligible to elect a three week\n      course of treatment with open-label placebo after which they will be assessed.  This study\n      has been submitted and approved by the following review board: Comiss\u00e3o de \u00c9tica do Centro\n      Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (Lisbon West Hospitals Centre's Ethical Committee)\n      Institutional Review Board."
