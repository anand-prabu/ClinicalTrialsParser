            "criteria": {
                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Subject is \u2265 50 years of age\n\n          -  Subject is willing to participate in this study and to follow the criteria and\n             protocol of this study.\n\n          -  The study eye is treatment na\u00efve regarding treatment of neovascular AMD.\n\n          -  Subject is not involved with another clinical study currently.\n\n          -  Subject is willing to follow the protocol outlined in the study.\n\n          -  Ability to understand the informed consent and willingness to sign the informed\n             consent.\n\n          -  Presence of a submacular vascularized or fibrovascular PED. The investigator must\n             search for the characteristic features of a vascularized PED summarized here:\n\n               1. A notch of irregularity associated with an orange-yellow round, oval, or\n                  bean-shaped elevation of the RPE with a smooth, convex surface is seen on\n                  examination and fundus photography (FP). Fluorescein angiography (FA) shows\n                  uniform staining of the PED with a well-defined margin, and more intense\n                  staining (hot-spot) for the focus of the CNV.\n\n               2. A fibrovascular PED with occult neovascularization typically shows stippled\n                  hyperfluorescence in the early phase with increasing hyperfluorescent staining\n                  and leakage in later phases of FA and a variable surrounding margin.  There may\n                  be RPE folds.\n\n               3. Regarding PED with a component of retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), the\n                  early features on FP including intraretinal neovascularization (IRN) frequently\n                  with adjacent small retinal hemorrhages in its lateral expansion in an\n                  irregularly stellate pattern before the development of retinal-choroidal\n                  anastomosis and the eventual PED in the later phases.  The investigator is\n                  required to perform indocyanine-green (ICG) angiography at baseline to establish\n                  a RAP lesion and to rule-out polypoidal vasculopathy lesions, since the FA\n                  images may not be distinct.\n\n               4. The investigator must also search for other features associated with a PED\n                  indicating the presence of a vascular component, i.e. hemorrhage, exudates,\n                  and/or chorioretinal folds.\n\n               5. The investigator must confirm the presence of a PED on FA/FP and OCT.  Spectral\n                  Domain OCT will be utilized.  Specifically, the Spectralis OCT manufactured by\n                  Heidleberg to maintain uniformity for all the sites.  The PED height, SA, GLD,\n                  and volume will be measured from the OCT images.  The characteristic OCT\n                  findings of the vascularized PED must be confirmed, including a distinct\n                  elevation of the highly hyperreflective RPE layer with mild backscattering of\n                  the underlying choroidal layer in the portion of the PED without any CNV.  For\n                  the portion of the PED with underlying CNV, typical OCT findings consist of\n                  moderate hyperreflectivity contiguous to the overlying markedly hyperreflective\n                  detached RPE corresponding to the CNV that usually extends to the choroidal\n                  layer.  Besides the OCT characteristics confirmation must be made on the FP/FA\n                  images of the vascularized PED, as outlined above in detail.\n\n          -  Central foveal involvement by the PED or the CNV due to age-related macular\n             degeneration (AMD).   The CNV may be classic, occult, or mixed, as long as it is\n             associated with a PED. The CNV may be within the PED or adjacent to the margin of the\n             PED.\n\n          -  PED \u2264 12 disc area in size.\n\n          -  BCVA with ETDRS of \u2265 19 letters and \u2264 73 letters (20/400 to 20/40).\n\n          -  Evidence of submacular fluid outside or surrounding the PED.\n\n          -  Surface area of the submacular hemorrhage needs to be < 50% of the entire PED.\n\n          -  Submacular fibrosis needs to be < 50% of the entire PED.\n\n          -  Sufficiently clear media (cornea, anterior chamber, lens, vitreous) for OCT, FA and\n             FP.\n\n          -  Intraocular pressure (IOP) of 25mmHg or less in the study eye, with or without use of\n             ocular hypotensive agents.\n\n          -  Prior treatment of neovascular AMD or any other forms of neovascularization in the\n             fellow eye, including anti-VEGF or other forms of therapy targeted specifically for\n             the fellow eye does not exclude the fellow eye from enrollment in this study.  Prior\n             focal corticosteroid treatment is allowed, as long as there is a lack of involvement\n             of the study eye.  However prior (within 90 days of Day 0) or current systemic\n             corticosteroid therapy (oral or intravenous corticosteroid treatment) is not\n             permitted.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Any prior treatment of neovascular AMD in eye for proposed enrollment (non-na\u00efve\n             eye), including previous anti-vascular endothelial factor (anti-VEGF) therapy,\n             photodynamic therapy (PDT), radiation therapy, corticosteroid treatment, surgical\n             treatment for CNV, thermal laser treatment, and any other prior treatment for\n             neovascular AMD.\n\n          -  Known serious allergies to aflibercept, fluorescein dye, drugs for pupillary\n             dilation, topical anesthetic, sterilizing solution (e.g. Betadine Solution).\n\n          -  Contraindication to pupillary dilation in study eye.\n\n          -  Any condition (including inability to read visual acuity charts, or language barrier)\n             that may preclude subjects ability to comply with the study protocol and\n             requirements.\n\n          -  Presence of any advanced systemic condition or end-stage disease, advanced Alzheimer\n             Syndrome, end-stage cancer, etc., which will likely prevent subject from completing\n             study.\n\n          -  Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye.\n\n          -  Prior retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear in study eye.\n\n          -  Prior ocular surgery (except YAG laser capsulotomy) for study within the past 90\n             days.\n\n          -  Anticipated ocular surgery (except YAG laser capsulotomy) for the next 12 months\n\n          -  Prior therapy for AMD (except minerals and vitamins), including laser.\n\n          -  Prior vitrectomy\n\n          -  Presence of any causes of CNV and PED other than due to AMD.\n\n          -  Presence of any substantial ocular disease (other than the CNV and PED) that may\n             compromise vision in the study eye and/or confound interpretation of the data; e.g.\n             substantial cataracts, concomitant  diabetic retinopathy affecting the macula,\n             advanced glaucoma, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy, or atrophy, marked macular\n             atrophy, ocular vascular occlusion, history of retinal detachment, uveitis, viral or\n             other forms of chorioretinitis, etc.\n\n          -  Presence of ocular disease other than AMD affecting study eye, i.e. presumed ocular\n             histoplasmosis syndrome, android streaks, pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent of\n             \u2265 -8 diopters of myopia or axial length of \u2265 25mm), choroidal rupture, multifocal\n             choroiditis, etc.\n\n          -  Active ocular infection (i.e., bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal) in either eye\n             at screening\n\n          -  Serous PED without neovascularization and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)\n             lesions are excluded.\n\n          -  Prior or current systemic anti-VEGF\n\n          -  Prior (within 90 days of Day 0) or current corticosteroid therapy (oral or\n             intravenous corticosteroid treatments).\n\n          -  Sexually active men* or women of child-bearing potential** who are unwilling to\n             practice adequate contraception during the study (adequate contraception measures\n             include, stable use of oral contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical\n             contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device\n             [IUD]; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam,\n             or jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly) *Contraception is\n             not required for men with documented vasectomy. ** Post-menopausal women must be\n             amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to be considered of child-bearing\n             potential.
