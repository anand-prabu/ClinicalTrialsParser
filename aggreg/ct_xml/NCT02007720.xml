             any time between presentation (including the emergency department) and the end of
             screening:

               -  Dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion

               -  Pulmonary congestion on chest radiograph

               -  Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥350 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥1,400 pg/mL

          -  Systolic BP ≥125 mmHg at the start and at the end of screening

          -  Able to be randomized within 16 hours from presentation to the hospital, including
             the emergency department

          -  Received intravenous furosemide of at least 40 mg total (or equivalent) at any time
             between presentation (this includes outpatient clinic, ambulance, or hospital
             including emergency department) and the start of screening for the study for the
             treatment of the current acute HF episode

          -  Renal impairment defined as an estimate glomerular filtration rate using the  between
             presentation and randomization of ≥ 25 and ≤75mL/min/1.73m2, calculated using the
             Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dyspnea primarily due to non-cardiac causes

          -  Temperature &gt;38.5°C (oral or equivalent) or sepsis or active infection requiring IV
             anti-microbial treatment

          -  Clinical evidence of acute coronary syndrome currently or within 30 days prior to
             enrollment

          -  AHF due to significant arrhythmias, which include any of the following: sustained
             ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia with sustained ventricular rate &lt;45 beats per
             minute, or atrial fibrillation/flutter with sustained ventricular response of &gt;130
             beats per minute

          -  Hepatic disease unrelated to Heart Failure etiology and as determined by any one of
             the following: AST and/or ALT values exceeding 3 X ULN and/or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN
             at screening or  history of hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, or portacaval
             shunt, or a diagnosis of cirrhosis by any means, or evidence of chronic Hepatitis B
             (presence of hepatitis B surface antigen production: positive HBsAg), or chronic
             Hepatitis C infection (presence of Hepatitis C genetic replication: positive
             Hepatitis C viral  RNA, based on history and/or clinical findings, including
             laboratory results obtained during screening period).

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
