Approximately half of patients develop hepatic metastases during the course of\n      the disease, and hepatic metastases are responsible for death in at least two thirds of CRC\n      patients.\n\n      Over the past decade, due to the introduction of irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based\n      combination chemotherapy, the median survival among patients with colorectal liver\n      metastases (CLM) has increased from 6 ~8 months to more than 20 months5.In recent years,\n      target therapy has rapidly gained attention for the treatment of CLM and is under active\n      investigation.\n\n      Although numerous publications have reported the efficacy of target therapy in combination\n      treatment for CLM patients, most of these studies focused solely on those patients without\n      undergoing resection of liver metastases. In contrast, little work has concentrated on\n      exploring the effection of target therapy for CLM patients undergoing Synchronic\n      Hepatectomy."
