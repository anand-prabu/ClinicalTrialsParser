ABMT is a modified dot probe task, in which a probe always appears in the location of neutral stimulus after the two stimuli (i.e. one is the depressive cue and the other is neutral) were simultaneously presented. In the ABMT,the probability that a probe appears in the location of neutral is 90%, and correspondingly,in the location of depressive stimuli is 10%. Each session consists of 320 trials, and the time to complete a training session is approximately 20 minutes."
