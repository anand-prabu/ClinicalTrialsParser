      Prospective, non-randomized, multi-center confirmatory observational study for the treatment
      of subjects with the need for vascular occlusion for the following conditions:

        1. Cohort A:  Varicocele arising from the spermatic vein(s) and pampiniform plexus, with
           or without concomitant diagnosis of infertility or subfertility

        2. Cohort B:  Pelvic varices in females for the treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome
           (e.g., pelvic venous incompetence).

        conditions:

          1. Cohort A:  Varicocele arising from the spermatic vein(s) and pampiniform plexus, with
             or without concomitant diagnosis of infertility or subfertility.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects aged ≥18 to ≤75 years.

          2. Subject with target vessels of 3.0 mm to 12.0 mm in diameter.

          3. Subject having indications to undergo embolotherapy consistent with clinical and
             pre-procedural angiographic assessment for spermatic vein origin varicocele
             (unilateral and/or bilateral) or pelvic congestion syndrome (pelvic venous
             incompetence).

          4. Subject is able and willing to comply with site standard medical follow-up, including
             one month follow-up visit.

          5. Subject or subject's legal representative have been informed of the nature of the
             study, agrees to participate and has signed the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has an active systemic infection.

          2. Subject has a known allergy to iodinated contrast for which they cannot be adequately
             premedicated.

          3. Subject has history of stroke within the prior 6 months.

          4. Subject has history of myocardial infarction with the prior 3 months.

          5. Subject has acute or chronic renal disease (e.g., as measured by a serum creatinine
             of &gt;2.5 mg/dL or &gt;220 umol/L), or on dialysis.

          6. Subject has a known coagulopathy or has a bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia with
             platelet count less than 100,000/microliter, or INR &gt;1.5.

          7. Co-morbid conditions that place the subject at an unacceptable surgical risk (e.g.,
             severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic failure, cardiac disease,
             autoimmune disorders or conditions of severe immunosuppression).

          8. Subjects in whom venography or arteriography is contraindicated.

          9. Subjects with known hypersensitivity or contraindication to nickel or nitinol.

         10. Subject has a less than one year life expectancy.

         11. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

         12. Subject with endometriosis or other ovarian / uterine pathology with adhesions that
             would interfere with the endpoints of this study.

         13. Subject with previous pelvic surgical intervention or embolotherapy for varicocele or
             ovarian varices that would interfere with the endpoints of this study, including but
             not limited to, recurrent varicocele or ovarian varices.

         14. Any clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the subject at
             increased risk with the deployment of the device.

         15. Subject has planned concomitant procedure at the time of the embolization (e.g., coil
             embolization, etc.).

         16. Subject is participating in another study of a device, medication, biologic, or other
             agent within 30 days or could, in the opinion of the investigator, impact the results
             of this study.

         17. Subject has other medical, social or psychological problems that in the opinion of
             the investigator would preclude them from receiving this treatment and the procedures
             and or participating in evaluations pre- and post-treatment.
