Triple\n      P is a system of interventions to support families and was developed at the University of\n      Queensland in Australia in the 1980's. As few studies have tested the effectiveness of\n      parenting programs in developing countries, the present study took place in a developing\n      country, Panama.\n\n      In a recent study carried out in Australia, this same intervention was found effective in\n      reducing child behaviour problems and the use of dysfunctional parenting (Morawska, Haslam,\n      Milne & Sanders, 2011)."

The groups were interactive and discussion\n      based, and a power point presentation with embedded-video clips were used to aid the\n      facilitator.

A statistician independent from the research team generated a random\n      list of numbers.  Randomization was stratified based on the level of child behavioural\n      difficulties (high or low) measured at baseline.  In order to ensure allocation concealment,\n      sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE) were opened after participants\n      agreed to take part in the study and completed a baseline assessment.  After randomization,\n      those assigned to the waiting list group were assessed at time 1 (baseline) and then 4\n      weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the first assessment.  Those assigned to the treatment\n      group were assessed at time 1 (baseline), 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the\n      intervention. Assessments were carried out by a research assistant who was blind to group\n      allocation."
