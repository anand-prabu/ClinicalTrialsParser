  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anaesthesia has become the cornerstone of multimodal analgesia. With the advent of
      ultrasound guided nerve blocks regional anaesthesia has achieved both greater efficacy and a
      better safety profile as the injection of local anaesthetic is performed under direct
      vision. This has allowed a reduction of the amount of local anaesthetic injected as compared
      to peripheral nerve stimulation technique . Blockade of sciatic nerve combined with
      saphenous nerve provides anaesthesia and analgesia for ankle/foot surgeries. Various
      combinations of local anaesthetics have been used to provide optimal blockade   . A mixture
      of lidocaine with a long acting local anaesthetic is commonly used. This provides a rapid
      onset of blockade, but of a consistently shorter duration compared to a long acting local
      anaesthetic alone. We hypothesize that sequential perineural injection of lidocaine and
      bupivacaine provides similar onset but a longer duration of sensory block compared to the
      same dose and volume of local anaesthetic mixed in advance.
