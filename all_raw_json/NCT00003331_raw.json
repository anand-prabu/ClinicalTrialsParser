Evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous infusion topotecan in\n      combination with fluorouracil for patients with advanced malignancy and establish a\n      recommended phase II dose based on the MTD. II. Evaluate the dose limiting toxicity of this\n      combination in these patients. II. Obtain pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for\n      topoisomerase-1 depletion in patients receiving this treatment. IV. Identify any objective\n      tumor responses arising from this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of topotecan in combination with fluorouracil.\n      Patients receive topotecan as a 24-hour continuous infusion on days 1-14 in combination with\n      fluorouracil IV and leucovorin calcium IV on days 1-5; course repeats every 4 weeks.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. In the\n      absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first cohort of 3 patients treated,\n      subsequent cohorts each receive escalating doses on the same schedule. If DLT is observed in\n      2 of 3 patients or 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation ceases and\n      the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
