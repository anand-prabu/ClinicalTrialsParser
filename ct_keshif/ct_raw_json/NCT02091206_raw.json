Part A is a randomized, double blind 21-day treatment study\n      period.  Subjects will be randomized to one of three doses of active or placebo at a 4:1\n      ratio.\n\n      Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be assigned a\n      unique participant number and then begin a 28-day baseline observation period.\n\n      The investigator will assess the subject's daily number of convulsive seizures from the\n      subject's diary data. Subjects who have experienced fewer than four convulsive seizures\n      (tonic-clonic seizures and/or drop attacks) during the baseline period and who meet all of\n      the other inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to continue in the\n      study.\n\n      Eligible subjects will then be randomly assigned to receive one of three dose levels of\n      GWP42003-P: 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg per day, or matching placebo.\n\n      There will be three groups of 10 subjects. In each group, subjects will be randomly assigned\n      so that eight subjects receive active treatment and two subjects receive placebo. Subjects\n      will receive GWP42003-P or placebo for a 21-day exposure period, which consists of a\n      titration period, followed by a stable dose period.\n\n      A pharmacokinetic assessment will take place after the first single dose of GWP42003-P.\n      There will be a second pharmacokinetic assessment after 21 days of consecutive dosing with\n      GWP42003-P. Subjects who take clobazam as an adjuvant treatment will be asked to take their\n      usual dose two hours prior to attending the clinic so that the pre-treatment (with\n      GWP42003-P) plasma concentrations of clobazam and its major metabolite N-desmethylclobazam\n      can be measured, and the impact of GWP42003-P treatment on these levels evaluated. An\n      interim clinical visit to (primarily) evaluate safety and adherence to the titration regimen\n      will take place seven days into the treatment period."
