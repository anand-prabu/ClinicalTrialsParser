  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is not only an 'inflammatory' demyelinating disease, but also
      includes axonal and neuronal injury in the grey matter . Neurodegenerative processes are
      partly independent of lesion formation and relapse activity , but represent the direct
      driver of clinical long-term disability and cognitive decline.

      Multimodal evoked potentials (EP), i.e. the combination of visual, somato-sensory and motor
      EP (VEP, SSEP, MEP) have been shown prospectively to provide objective, monovectorial, and
      numerical data which are closely correlated to the EDSS. As EP capture the functional
      integrity of the examined systems they represent a method unbiased for directional changes,
      while remaining specific for the neuronal function, and hence can measure deterioration, as
      well as improvement, a germane advantage to capture drug response.

      High-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) allow for explorative analysis of potential
      surrogate markers for cognitive decline.

      Ocrelizumab (OCR), a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody has shown strong treatment
      effects on number of T1Gd-enhancing lesions , on new T1Gd-enhancing and new T2-hyperintense
      lesions as well as on the annualized relapse rate in a recent phase II trial in
      relapsing-remitting MS.

      The present study will investigate the effects of OCR on multimodal evoked potentials (EP),
      Furthermore, quantitative EEG as a potential correlate of cognitive dysfunction and fatigue
      will be explored.

        The study population will be a sub-sample of the above mentioned multi-center, randomized,
        double-blind, phase III trials (&quot;Oratorio&quot;, &quot;Opera I&quot; and &quot;Opera II&quot;) and will comprise
        approximately 100 PPMS and 100 RRMS patients. Treatment groups will only be disclosed
        after completion of the phase III trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  definitive inclusion in one of the phase III trials on OCR: RRMS patients in &quot;Opera
             I&quot; (WA21092B) or &quot;Opera II&quot; (WA21093), PPMS patients in &quot;Oratorio&quot; (WA25046B) and
             fulfilling the respective inclusion criteria

          -  stable clinical state (at least 4 weeks after treatment with corticoids, when there
             was a relapse)

          -  Provision of written informed consent and ability to be compliant with the schedule
             of assessments of the present study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  exclusion criteria of both phase III trials on OCR also apply to the present study

          -  additionally patients with movable metal implants, e.g. pace-maker, stents, deep
             brain stimulators are excluded; (patients with jaw- or bone-fixed metal implants can
             be included)
