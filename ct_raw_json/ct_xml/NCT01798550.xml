    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine an effective enoxaparin dosing strategy in
      medically ill, morbidly obese patients. This study will include adult patients greater than
      18 yrs of age being admitted to Grady Hospital in Atlanta, GA. Potentially vulnerable
      patients such as prisoners, children, and pregnant women will not be enrolled in the study.
      Study participants will be contacted in person by the study personnel once inclusion
      criteria are met. Written informed consent will be obtained in person while hospitalized.
      Once the patient is consented they will be given enoxaparin and blood samples will be drawn.
      The data collected will be from the electronic medical record which is accessed only with a
      username and password so it is not publicly available. The data will be identifiable upon
      collection and will be kept on a password protected file on a computer in a locked office.
      The data will be de-identified after data analysis and only the study personnel will have
      access to the code that links identifiers to subjects. A HIPAA waiver will be requested to
      access existing data in order to identify patients for enrollment. All data will be
      collected in an office in the hospital. The study participants' burden will be minimal and
      dependent only on time of consent process since morbidly obese patients would be receiving
      this blood sample collection regardless of their participation in the study.
