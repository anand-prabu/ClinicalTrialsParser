Parents of 450 delinquent\n      receiving JJS services as usual (SAU) will be randomly assigned to: PW plus a social\n      networking online discussion forum, PW alone, or SAU.  The investigators will also determine\n      the potential marketability of the PW intervention to JJS programs based on the effects of\n      PW on parent report and direct observation measures of parenting behaviors, adolescent\n      behaviors, and family functioning, as well as measures of recidivism and cost savings. User\n      satisfaction, program comprehension, receptivity, and parent self-efficacy will also be\n      assessed. The investigators hypothesize that the two PW interventions (PW only and PW +\n      Social Network) will produce greater reductions in disruptive behavior problems from\n      baseline to 3- and 6-month assessments compared to SAU."

            "textblock": "Research has shown that parent-targeted interventions are effective in ameliorating\n      adolescent conduct disorders, substance abuse, HIV-risk, and related adolescent problem\n      behaviors. The meteoric rise of Internet use and recent advance in multimedia technology and\n      software combine to create new opportunities for disseminating evidence-based practices.\n      Parenting Wisely (PW; Gordon, 2000) is a computer-based intervention designed to prevent and\n      treat child disruptive behavior problems. This evidence-based approach fits easily into\n      existing juvenile justice, health, education, and mental health service delivery systems,\n      bypassing many of the current barriers to care. The investigators' Phase I study focused on\n      revising and enhancing PW with more culturally relevant content and imagery to broaden its\n      appeal to ethnically diverse populations. The findings revealed substantial improvements on\n      virtually all measures of parenting and child behavior and outcomes at 6 months were highly\n      significant and clinically meaningful. This Phase II study is designed to broaden the appeal\n      and potential reach of PW through a formal randomized trial conducted in collaboration with\n      the juvenile justice system (JJS), the primary market for such a program. Parents of 450\n      delinquent receiving JJS services as usual (SAU) will be randomly assigned to: PW plus a\n      social networking online discussion forum, PW alone, or SAU. PW is the first online\n      skill-building parent training program to examine effectiveness across different ethnic\n      cultural groups and offers a brief, low cost, accessible approach that could be easily and\n      quickly implemented and sustained in JJS settings. As such, the potential impact for\n      marketing PW and reducing child behavior problems is considerable. Phase II activities will\n      include the development of a moderated online forum to increase parental social support and\n      skill acquisition. The investigators will also determine the potential marketability of the\n      PW intervention to JJS programs based on the effects of PW on parent report and direct\n      observation measures of parenting behaviors, adolescent behaviors, and family functioning,\n      as well as measures of recidivism and cost savings. User satisfaction, program\n      comprehension, receptivity, and parent self-efficacy will also be assessed."
