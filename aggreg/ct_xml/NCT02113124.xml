  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Years after a suffering a brain injury, individuals remain in a physically and cognitively
      impaired state. The investigators  believe that the concentrations of amino acids in the
      blood are chronically altered and yield negative effects on the individuals health.
      Understanding these changes will help guide rehabilitative services for this population.
      Individuals with a chronic brain injury will donate samples of blood to be compared to that
      of non-injured individuals.

    <description>5 ml of blood will be acquired following a 8-hour fasting period to determine baseline concentrations of amino acids. A meal will then be provided and another blood sample will be acquired 90 minutes after completing the meal to examine the change in amino acid concentration. These samples will be used to determine the levels of each essential amino acid present.</description>

        Individuals in the chronic brain injured group are recruited from Tideway, a long-term
        care facility for individuals who have suffered a brain injury. The cohorts for this study
        will be recruited from the community in Galveston, Texas and the surrounding areas.
