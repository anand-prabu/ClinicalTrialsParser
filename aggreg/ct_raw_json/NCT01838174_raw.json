The primary,\n      secondary, and tertiary outcomes will be as noted above.  The assessing physicians will be\n      blinded to treatment to minimize bias.  We intend to recruit a target number of 3\n      participants per month and to complete recruitment within 10 months.  This rate of\n      recruitment is estimated on the incidence of optic neuritis among the visits to the Rocky\n      Mountain MS Center and the University of Texas Southwestern (tertiary care MS centers with >\n      6,000 patient visits/year). Participants will be assessed for inclusion/exclusion criteria\n      by their treating neurologist at the Rocky Mountain MS Center (PI- Dr. Jeffrey Bennett) or\n      University of Texas Southwestern (PI - Dr. Elliot Frohman), and following informed consent,\n      will be randomized with gender, prior diagnosis of MS, disease modifying treatment (DMT)\n      usage (interferons vs. Glatiramer Acetate vs. Tysabri/Gilenya/Aubagio/Tecfidera vs. no\n      treatment), and time to randomization as binary minimization data.  We expect to enroll 30\n      subjects per institution.\n\n      Following informed consent and randomization, participants will receive treatment either\n      high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg IV daily for 3 days followed by 60 mg oral prednisone\n      daily for 11 days) or Acthar (80 U IM or SQ daily for 5 days followed by 40 U IM or SQ daily\n      for 10 days).

During each visit, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, low\n      contrast acuity (2.5%), and color vision (Farnsworth D-15) will be assessed.  OCT\n      evaluations (ONH and macular cube) will be performed at months 0, 1, 3 and 6 months using\n      spectral domain OCT (Cirrus OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA).  Automated\n      visual fields (Humphrey 30-2 SITA) will be performed at baseline and month 6.  MfVEP,\n      multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), fundus photography (to assess for pallor) and\n      pupillometry will be performed at baseline, month 3 and month 6 in the cohort of patients\n      recruited at the University of Texas Southwestern.
