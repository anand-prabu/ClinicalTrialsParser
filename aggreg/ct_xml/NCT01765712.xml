  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate whether or not platelet rich plasma
      (PRP) may help to improve tendon healing and decrease post operative pain in patients
      undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery using their own patellar
      tendons as autografts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently a paucity of well-designed, prospective, randomized, blinded (Level 1)
      clinical studies that carefully and comprehensively investigate the role of PRP in ACL
      surgery. Specifically, ACL reconstruction using Bone Patellar Tendon Bone (BPTB) harvest and
      the role of PRP in decreasing postoperative pain at the donor site. Given the need for a
      highly powered study to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of PRP in ACL reconstruction, the
      investigators have designed a prospective, randomized, level 1, double-blinded study to
      evaluate the effects of PRP on the specific outcomes of donor site pain and radiographic
      measures of graft healing and incorporation.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intra-operatively applied autologous
      PRP in reducing donor site morbidity and increasing radiographic healing in ACL
      reconstruction using autologous BPTB.

    <description>The primary outcome measured will be anterior knee pain. The investigators will do so by using Visual Analog Scales as an assessment tool. The visual analog scales will include pain with activities of daily living and pain with kneeling activities. Information regarding these pain scales will be collected at 14 days and 1,3,6,12,18 and 24 months</description>

    <description>Post-op MRI's will be obtained to quantify the amount of bony healing at the donor site and revascularization of native patellar tendon at the harvest site. These images will be interpreted by one blinded senior musculoskeletal radiologist.</description>

    <description>The patients range of motion will be assessed on both the operative and non-operative knee. This information will be assessed using a goniometer and will be collected by a blinded clinician.</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomized into the treatment arm using a computer generated randomization table (simple randomization). Patients in the control arm of the study will undergo Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using Autologous bone patellar tendon bone autograft. At the end of the surgery, their graft donor site will have bone graft chips placed into the bony defect and the wound will be closed using sutures.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized into the treatment arm of the study will undergo Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with Autologous bone patellar tendon bone autografts. At the start of the surgery,just after the administration of anesthesia, 10cc of blood will be withdrawn from the patients IV by the anesthesiologist. This sample will be spun down into 3-5cc of Platelet Rich Plasma which will be added to the patients bone graft chips and placed into the donor site at the end of the case.</description>
