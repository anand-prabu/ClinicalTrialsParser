            "textblock": "In the last forty years the prevalence of asthma has increased in westernised countries. We\n      have hypothesised that this increase may be a consequence of changing diet. Several birth\n      cohort studies have now reported an association between reduced maternal vitamin E intake\n      during pregnancy and childhood asthma.\n\n      However, it remains to be seen whether increasing maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy\n      reduces the risk of childhood asthma. We are planning a large placebo controlled trial in\n      pregnant women, to investigate whether optimisation of dietary vitamin E intake to the\n      recommended 15mg/day reduces the likelihood of childhood asthma. We believe that a dietary\n      intervention using vitamin E in its natural form of food is more likely to be successful and\n      acceptable than a vitamin E supplement. We have previously demonstrated than pregnant women\n      can optimise their vitamin E intake using a personalised dietary plan with the help of a\n      dietitian however this intervention was complex and could not be translated into everyday\n      use. With commercial support we have developed a range of soups containing foods naturally\n      rich in vitamin E designed to optimise maternal vitamin E intake to 15mg/day. A range of\n      similar tasting and looking placebo soups has also been developed. In this study we will\n      pilot a randomised controlled trial of the active and placebo soups to ascertain whether\n      pregnant women are willing and able to optimise their vitamin E intake during pregnancy\n      using the soups in order to reduce the risk of their child developing asthma. optimising\n      maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy."
