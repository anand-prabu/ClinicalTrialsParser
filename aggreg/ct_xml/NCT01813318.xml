  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent pharmacotherapy research in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has successfully focused
      on treatment of co-occurring symptoms, including inattention, hyperactivity, and
      irritability that commonly occur in persons with ASD. Despite over two decades of
      significant pharmacotherapy research, to date no medication has been shown in controlled
      trials to enhance the core social deficits of ASD. Based upon findings describing the
      neurobiology of ASD combined with our preliminary results, we believe the novel drug
      acamprosate will show evidence of reducing social skills deficits associated with ASD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject with ASD will receive 10 weeks of blinded treatment with acamprosate or
      matching placebo. After completion of the double-blind phase, all subjects will have an
      opportunity to receive acamprosate as part of the study procedures for 16 weeks.
