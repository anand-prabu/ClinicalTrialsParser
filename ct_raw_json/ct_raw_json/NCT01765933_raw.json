            "textblock": "1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA) has become increasingly popular as a component of dietary\n      supplements. It is also used within \"party pills,\" often in conjunction with alcohol and\n      other drugs, and has been associated with untoward effects when abused at high dosages. To\n      our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to determine the combined pharmacokinetic\n      profile and physiologic responses of DMAA. To conclude on the safety profile of DMAA based\n      solely on case reports would be problematic, in particular when accepting testimony from\n      patients in uncontrolled environment, potentially under the influence of alcohol and other\n      drugs. This is especially true in light of the fact that no prospective studies have shown\n      these effects. Hence, the intent of the present study was to determine the pharmacokinetic\n      profile of a single 25mg oral dosage of DMAA alone through 24 hours post-ingestion. This\n      represents a typical dosage within one serving of many popular dietary supplements\n      containing DMAA."
