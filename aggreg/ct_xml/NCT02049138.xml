        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have completed Study M13-550 or Study M13-537 with ABT-494 and has not
             developed any discontinuation criteria.

          2. If the subject has evidence of new latent Tuberculosis (TB) infection, the subject
             must initiate and complete a minimum of 2 weeks (or per local guidelines, whichever
             is longer) of an ongoing TB prophylaxis before continuing to receive study drug.

          3. If female, subject must meet one of the following criteria:

               -  Postmenopausal (defined as no menses for at least 1 year).

          3. Anticipated requirement or receipt of any live vaccine during study participation
             including up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

          4. Laboratory values from the visit immediately prior to Baseline Visit meeting the
             following criteria:
