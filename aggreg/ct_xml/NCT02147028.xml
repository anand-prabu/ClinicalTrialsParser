  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether sparing the hippocampi during whole brain
      radiotherapy following neurosurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with brain
      metastases from a systemic tumour helps preserve brain function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 16  years

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70

          -  Brain metastases from systemic malignancy which has been histologically confirmed
             (from the primary or any metastatic site)

          -  In total, at most 4 distinct brain metastases based on MRI imaging with contrast at
             any prior time-points

          -  Each of the brain metastases must either be in complete radiological remission on
             contrast MRI imaging, or have been treated by neurosurgery or by SRS in line with UK
             SRS commissioning guidelines within the following timeframes:

               -  If treated by neurosurgery only, the patient must be registered within 4 weeks
                  of the date of neurosurgery (or of the first neurosurgery)

               -  If treated by SRS only, the patient must be registered within 4 weeks of
                  treatment to each individual metastasis being completed (i.e. within 4 weeks of
                  the last SRS fraction to each metastasis)

               -  If treated by both neurosurgery and SRS, then the patient must be registered
                  within 6 weeks of the treatment to each individual metastasis being completed
                  (i.e. within 6 weeks of the neurosurgery and within 6 weeks of the last SRS
                  fraction to each metastasis)

          -  Ability to complete NCF test battery (including ability to speak English)

          -  Willing and able to give consent and to comply with treatment and follow up schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastases from small cell carcinoma, haematological malignancy, or central nervous
             system malignancy

          -  Leptomeningeal metastases

          -  Contraindication to MRI imaging with contrast

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the brain, apart from SRS for brain metastases completed within
             6 weeks of trial registration

          -  Metastases currently or previously within 5 mm of either hippocampus

          -  Disease specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) score ≤ 1.0 for any of the
             histologies for which DS-GPA has been defined [Sperduto 2012]

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are known to be pregnant
