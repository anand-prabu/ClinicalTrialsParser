It is unknown whether vitamin D deficiency contributes directly to adverse\n      outcomes or whether it is simply a biomarker of severity of illness or overall health\n      status.  However, vitamin D plays a key role in host defense, largely by stimulating\n      production of the anti-microbial peptide cathelicidin (LL-37).  We will test the hypothesis\n      that administration of activated vitamin D (calcitriol) will increase serum levels of\n      cathelicidin."
