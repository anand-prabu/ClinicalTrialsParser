Currently we find the causal bug (bacteria\n      or virus) in less than 50% of patients with pneumonia. A potential way to better find the\n      bug responsible may include checking for bugs in the nose by a nasal wash or swab. Better\n      diagnostics would allow more targeted antibiotic therapy and in the future this technique\n      may be used as a way of checking the efficiency of new vaccines.\n\n      We are recruiting both patients with respiratory infections and also a 'control' group of\n      patients admitted to hospital who do not have respiratory infection. We need to have access\n      to your medical history information to make sure you are eligible and suitable for the\n      study.
