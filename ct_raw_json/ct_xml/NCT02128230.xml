  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the clinical outcomes of research subjects with
      high-risk multiple myeloma in the context of the immediately preceding Total therapy 5 trial
      2008-02 and Total therapy 3 trials 2003-33 and 2006-66.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total therapy 5B will attempt to accelerate and sustain, at 2 years from starting therapy,
      the proportion of subjects in complete remission by reducing host-imposed toxicity and
      facilitating timely completion of highly synergistic 8-drug combination therapy, including
      the next generation proteasome inhibitor, Carfilzomib. This will result in avoiding multiple
      myeloma re-growth that, we postulate, ensued in Total therapy 3 during recovery phases from
      severe de-conditioning.  It is speculated that the incidence of positive minimal residual
      disease will be reduced with the addition of one cycle of consolidation therapy.  The
      following approach will be implemented:

        -  apply a 4-day fractionated lower dose melphalan (80 mg/m2) together with CFZ-TD-PACE
           regimen in MEL80-CFZ-TD (carfilzomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE as a hopefully
           less toxic and more effective transplant regimen

        -  interspersed with 1 cycle of non-transplant supported MEL-20-CFZ-TD (carfilzomib,
           thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE (in lower doses than with transplant) inter-therapy
           (reduced from two cycles due to prolonged thrombocytopenia)

        -  followed by CFZ-TD (carfilzomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE consolidation therapy
           post transplant #2

        -  CFZ-RD (carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone) maintenance for 1 year followed by
           CFZ-D for an additional year

    <description>Melphalan and Carfilzomib will be given into a central venous catheter.  Dexamethasone is a pill that is taken by mouth daily for 4 days.  Thalidomide is a capsule taken by mouth for 4 days.  Cisplatin, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide and Etoposide are all given into the vein (IV) by a continuous infusion through a central catheter for 4 days.  After completion of the four days of continuous chemotherapy, a drug G-CSF will be given.  This is a shot just under the skin to help the bone marrow and blood counts recover more quickly after chemotherapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have newly diagnosed active MM requiring treatment. Patients with a
             previous history of smoldering myeloma will be eligible if there is evidence of
             progressive disease requiring chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must be either untreated or have not had more than one cycle of systemic MM
             therapy, excluding bisphosphonates and localized radiation.

          -  Participants must have high-risk disease, as defined by GEP70 risk score of ≥ 0.66

          -  Zubrod ≤ 2, unless solely due to symptoms of MM-related bone disease.

          -  Patients must have a platelet count of ≥ 50,000/μL, unless lower levels are explained
             by extensive bone marrow plasmacytosis.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and not older than 75 years of age at the
             time of registration.

          -  Participants must have preserved renal function as defined by a serum creatinine
             level of &lt; 3 mg/dL.

          -  Participants must have an ejection fraction by ECHO or MUGA scan ≥ 45%

          -  Patients must have adequate pulmonary function studies &gt; 50% of predicted on
             mechanical aspects (FEV1, FVC, etc) and diffusion capacity (DLCO) &gt; 50% of predicted.
             If the patient is unable to complete pulmonary function tests due to MM related pain
             or condition, exception may be granted if the principal investigator documents that
             the patient is a candidate for high dose therapy.

          -  Patients must have signed an IRB-approved informed consent indicating their
             understanding of the proposed treatment and understanding that the protocol has been
             approved by the IRB.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Does not have high-risk disease

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or other serious medical illness
             or psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere with the completion of
             treatment according to this protocol.

          -  Patients must not have prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the
             patient has not received treatment for one year prior to enrollment. Other cancers
             will only be acceptable if the patient's life expectancy exceeds five years.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of childbearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy documented within one week of registration. Subjects of
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an
             effective contraceptive method.
