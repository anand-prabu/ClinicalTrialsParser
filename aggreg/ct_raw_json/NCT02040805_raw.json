Specifically, we will compare a novel\n      community-based group treatment led by individuals from the community who are not mental\n      health professionals to the current standard of care treatment for Hoarding Disorder,\n      cognitive behavioral therapy, conducted by psychologists in a group setting.  We\n      hypothesized that  both treatment types will be similarly effective in reducing hoarding\n      severity."

Participants will be\n      stratified by gender, psychiatric status (high vs. low burden of psychiatric symptoms) and\n      insurance status (insured vs. under- or un-insured) so that equal numbers of individuals\n      with each of these characteristics are randomized to each treatment arm. They will then be\n      randomly assigned (randomized) to either G-CBT or G-BiT. Participants will know which\n      treatment group they are assigned to, but those members of the research team who are\n      conducting clinical or neuropsychological assessments or analyzing the data will not; they\n      will be blinded to participant group assignment, and group leaders will be blinded to the\n      psychiatric status, neurocognitive status, insurance status, etc, of participants. The study\n      is a non-inferiority trial, that is, the hypothesis to be tested is that G-BiT is as\n      effective, or no less effective, than G-CBT. We chose a non-inferiority design because we\n      have no reason to believe G-BiT is better than G-CBT and our preliminary data, as well as\n      outcomes previously reported for G- CBT and G-BiT, suggest that these treatments may have\n      similar efficacies."
