The following data will be\n      assessed and performed: informed consent signed and dated, inclusion and exclusion criteria\n      for the study, a full medical history including current medication, physical examination and\n      laboratory examination of blood/urine samples. For women in childbearing potential a urine\n      pregnancy test will be performed.\n\n      Hypoglycaemic Visit (Visit2):\n\n      Each subject will be asked to attend the clinical unit at approximately 20:00 in the evening\n      on day 1. Thereafter the subject will receive an insulin and glucose infusion intravenously\n      in order to obtain a steady state of a PG level of 5.5 mmol/L overnight until approximately\n      08:00 in the morning of day 2. At 05:00 hours D-[6,6-2H2] glucose (100 g/l) solution will be\n      given i.v. as a primed (9.6 mg/kg/min) for one minute and a constant (0.08 mg/kg/min)\n      infusion until the last blood sampling of the plasma glucose level of 4.0 mmol/L will be\n      performed.\n\n      At 08:00 hours in the morning at day 2, insulin infusion will be increased to 1.5 mU/kg/min\n      for each subject and the Plasma Glucose will be kept at a plateau of 5.5 mmol/L by a\n      controlled variable intravenous infusion of glucose (10% glucose enriched with 4mg [6,6-2H2]\n      glucose /ml) for one hour. Afterwards, plasma glucose is allowed to fall to a plateau of 3.5\n      mmol/L, then to a nadir of 2.5 mmol/L, then to a blood glucose level of 4.0 mmol/L and\n      finally back to a level of 5.5 mmol/L for safety reasons. Blood sampling for measurement of\n      plasma glucose, [6,6-2H2] glucose (labelled glucose), vital signs, hypoglycaemic symptoms\n      questionnaire and hypoglycaemic awareness will be performed at each plasma glucose plateau.\n      The subject will be discharged from the clinic at day 2, or later if deemed necessary by the\n      investigator.\n\n      Follow up Visit (Visit 3):\n\n      The subject will attend the Visit 3, 3 - 10 days after Visit 2. The following data will be\n      assessed and performed: concomitant medication, including current diabetes treatment,\n      adverse events, a full physical examination and laboratory examination of blood/urine\n      samples.
