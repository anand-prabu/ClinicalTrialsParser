            "textblock": "Byler Disease is the result of a homozygous missense (G308V) mutation in the ATP8B1 gene.\n      The disease is typically manifest in the first year of life on the basis of complications of\n      cholestasis; common presentations include jaundice, poor growth, bleeding related to vitamin\n      K deficiency, and/or weak bones related to vitamin D deficiency.  Early management of Byler\n      Disease is directed at nutritional issues which tend to be responsive to medical\n      intervention, unlike the pruritus/scratching which remains a devastating problem.\n      Progressive liver disease develops in Byler Disease and can lead to cirrhosis and end-stage\n      liver disease.  This is an open label expanded access protocol of RAVICTI in children with\n      Byler Disease.  The primary hypothesis is that the administration of RAVICTI in these\n      children is feasible, well tolerated and safe.  It is also hypothesized that RAVICTI\n      treatment leads to an improvement in biochemical markers of liver disease and it may\n      ameliorates or prevents the development of scratching behavior as a manifestation of\n      pruritus attributed to the liver disease."
