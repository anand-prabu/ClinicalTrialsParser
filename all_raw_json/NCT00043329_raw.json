In addition, evaluation of the possible\n      effect of Actimmune therapy on the humoral response to normal childhood vaccinations in this\n      same patient population will be examined.Interferon gamma is a substance that the body makes\n      naturally."

It is also approved in patients\n      with severe, malignant osteopetrosis to delay the time to disease progression.  In research\n      trials, IFN-g 1b has been given to over 2,000 patients in diseases such as CGD,\n      osteopetrosis, atopic dermatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, atypical mycobacteria and various\n      cancers."
