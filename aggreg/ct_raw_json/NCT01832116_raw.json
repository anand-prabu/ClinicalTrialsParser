MMOT0530A is a monoclonal antibody that targets an\n      antigen overexpressed in pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Subsequent to imaging with\n      89Zr-MMOT0530A, patients will be treated with DMOT4039A in the DMO4993g protocol\n      (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01469793) after this study. DMOT4039A is an antibody-drug\n      conjugate composed of the monoclonal antibody MMOT0530A and the mitotic agent monomethyl\n      auristatin (MMAE).  By imaging patients with the monoclonal antibody MMOT0530A before\n      treatment, the correlation between tumor uptake of 89Zr-MMOT0530A and response to DMOT4039A\n      therapy will be assessed."

            "textblock": "A challenge in current drug development using molecular targeted therapies is the high level\n      of heterogeneity that is present in specific tumor types. The ability to safely and\n      accurately predict the presence or absence of the target is essential for the therapeutic\n      effect of the newly developed drugs. DMOT0439A is one of those novel designed molecular\n      targeted drugs; an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the monoclonal antibody MMOT0530A and\n      the mitotic agent monomethyl auristatin (MMAE). In the DMO4993g protocol (clinicaltrials.gov\n      identifier NCT01469793), the safety and efficacy of DMOT4039A is assessed in patients with\n      unresectable pancreatic or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. By performing a 89Zr-MMOT0530A\n      PET scan prior to treatment with DMOT4039A, the uptake of the tracer in the primary and\n      metastatic tumor lesions can be evaluated. This is likely to provide important information\n      about target expression, whole body drug distribution and the correlation between tumor\n      uptake and response to therapy. Ultimately the use of a 89Zr- MMOT0530A PET as a\n      complimentary tool for patient selection and risk stratification can be evaluated. In part A\n      of this study, the optimal tracer dose of 89Zr- MMOT0530A and schedule for PET imaging will\n      be determined. In part B patients will have PET imaging before treatment in the DMO4993g\n      study on the dose and time points as assessed in part A."
