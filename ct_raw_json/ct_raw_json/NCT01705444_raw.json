Solving the problem of acute urinary\n      retention using the Foley catheter still causes problems at the level of patient movement\n      and the daily exercises. However, with the emergence of a new device, the spanner,\n      investigators believe that many of the above mentioned problems can be resolved. This tool\n      may provide more freedom for the patient."

Investigators will test two different types of stents in patients with acute urinary\n      retention for a short period (not exceeding five days), find out the compatibility of these\n      stents with the daily life of the patient and determine their impact on his quality of life\n      using an appropriate questionnaire after each use."
