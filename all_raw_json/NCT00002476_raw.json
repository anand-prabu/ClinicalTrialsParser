Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. It is not yet known if radiation therapy plus chemotherapy is more effective than\n      radiation therapy alone in treating patients with advanced head and neck cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with\n      or without chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced head and neck cancer."

Determine whether the addition of methotrexate (MTX) or VBMF\n      (vincristine/bleomycin/methotrexate/fluorouracil) to radiotherapy for advanced carcinoma of\n      the head and neck (with or without primary surgery) influences locoregional control and\n      prolongs survival. II. Determine whether an effect on locoregional control or survival is\n      apparent when chemotherapy is given during or following radiotherapy and whether it is\n      increased when chemotherapy is given at both times. III. Determine, in a special\n      randomization of patients with cancer of the oral cavity or oropharynx, whether neck\n      irradiation improves locoregional control and survival.\n\n      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients without prior surgery are randomized 1:2 to Arms\n      I:II-IV, while those with prior surgery are randomized 1:1 between Arms I and II only.\n      Patients with tumors of the oral cavity or oropharynx may elect additional randomization\n      between Arms V and VI and will receive irradiation of the primary according to the\n      Manchester regimen. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Irradiation of the primary and/or lymph nodes\n      according to 1 of 2 regimens (Manchester 3-week schedule or SECOG 6-week schedule) using\n      megavoltage equipment. Arm II: Radiotherapy plus Concurrent Single-agent or 4-Drug\n      Combination Chemotherapy with Leucovorin Rescue. Involved-field irradiation as in Arm I;\n      plus Methotrexate, MTX, NSC-740; with Leucovorin calcium, CF, NSC-3590; or VBMF:\n      Vincristine, VCR, NSC-67574; Bleomycin, BLEO, NSC-125066; MTX; Fluorouracil, 5-FU,\n      NSC-19893; with CF. Arm III: Radiotherapy plus Subsequent Single-agent or 4-Drug Combination\n      Chemotherapy with Leucovorin Rescue. Involved-field irradiation as in Arm I; plus MTX or\n      VBMF; with CF. Arm IV: Radiotherapy plus Concurrent and Subsequent Single-agent or 4-Drug\n      Combination Chemotherapy with Leucovorin Rescue. Involved-field irradiation as in Arm I;\n      plus MTX or VBMF; with CF. Arm V: Radiotherapy. Neck node irradiation using megavoltage\n      equipment. Arm VI: Observation. No nodal irradiation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 1,000 patients will be entered."
