Transaminases (SGOT and/or SGPT) may be up\n             to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal if alkaline phosphatase is less than the\n             upper limit of normal, or alkaline phosphatase may be up to 4 X upper limit of normal\n             if transaminases are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal\n\n          -  For patients with disease progression defined by measurable disease: changes in\n             measurable size of lymph nodes or parenchymal masses on physical or radiologic\n             examination (bone scan findings are not adequate to assess measurable disease).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        The following patients are not eligible for the study:\n\n          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases or leptomeningeal involvement\n\n          -  Patients with any peripheral neuropathy or unresolved diarrhea greater than Grade 1\n\n          -  Patients with severe cardiac insufficiency\n\n          -  Patients taking Coumadin or other warfarin-containing agents with the exception of\n             low dose Coumadin (1 mg or less) for the maintenance of in-dwelling lines or ports\n\n          -  Patients who received palliative radiotherapy to tumors located centrally less than 4\n             weeks (28 days) prior to planned enrollment date (palliative radiotherapy to isolated\n             peripheral bone metastases is allowed)\n\n          -  Patients experiencing hormone withdrawal syndrome, or are 28 days post-withdrawal of\n             anti-androgen therapy (42 days for bicalutamide)\n\n          -  Patients who have had more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for hormone-resistant\n             metastatic disease\n\n          -  Patients with disease measurable only by bone scan\n\n          -  Patients who have received corticosteroids within the past 28 days (may be waived\n             with approval from Novartis)\n\n          -  History of another malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry except curatively\n             treated non-melanoma skin cancer\n\n          -  Patients who have undergone major surgery for any cause less than 4 weeks prior to\n             study entry\n\n          -  Patients with radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last four weeks\n\n          -  Patients with active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection including\n             abcesses or fistulae\n\n          -  HIV+ patients"
