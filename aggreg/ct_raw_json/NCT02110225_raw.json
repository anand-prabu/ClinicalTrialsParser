The\n      secondary objective of this study is to attempt to show a dose response by assessing the\n      potential efficacy of the rhNGF dose regimens for improving or slowing the deterioration of\n      visual function outcomes at 3 and 6 months.  During a 6 month follow-up period patients will\n      be monitored to determine if there is evidence of a persistent biological effect after\n      discontinuation of the study treatment."
