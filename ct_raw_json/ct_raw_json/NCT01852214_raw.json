This may be in part attributed to the fact that these patients have reduced response\n      to oral antiplatelet medications, in particular the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor clopidogrel,\n      used for secondary prevention of ischemic events. Upregulation of platelet P2Y12 receptor\n      mediated signaling has been shown in DM patients and may contribute to these pharmacodynamic\n      observations, suggesting the need for more potent P2Y12 inhibiting strategies in these\n      patients. Prasugrel and ticagrelor are recently approved P2Y12 receptor inhibitors which,\n      compared with clopidogrel, have more potent antiplatelet effects. Therefore, prasugrel and\n      ticagrelor represent attractive treatment options for patients with DM. This is also\n      supported by the DM sub-group analysis of the pivotal TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess\n      Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with\n      Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) and PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient\n      Outcomes) trials, which have led to approval of prasugrel and ticagrelor, respectively.\n      Although results of these sub-group analysis suggest that prasugrel is associated with an\n      enhanced benefit in DM patients, while ticagrelor effects in DM patients are consistent with\n      the overall study population, only head-to-head comparisons between the two drugs can\n      elucidate if these exert differential effects on platelets from DM patients. However, the\n      pharmacodynamic studies comparing prasugrel with ticagrelor in DM patients are lacking. The\n      ever growing DM population at high risk of recurrent atherothrombotic events underscores the\n      need to define antiplatelet treatment strategies leading to more optimal platelet inhibition\n      in these patients."
