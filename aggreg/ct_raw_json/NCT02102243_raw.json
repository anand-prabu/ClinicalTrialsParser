In patients with essential\n      hypertension, plasma aldosterone levels have been also shown to positively correlate with\n      indices of insulin resistance.\n\n      Mechanism underlying aldosterone-induced insulin resistance is unknown. Aldosterone has been\n      shown to interfere with insulin signaling the vascular cells by increasing production of\n      reactive oxygen species via activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in decreased availability\n      of nitric oxide (NO), the key mediator for insulin-mediated vasodilation. Treatment with\n      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in mice\n      with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Aldosterone has also been shown to increase resting\n      sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity to the peripheral circulation. However, effects of\n      aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on insulin-mediated skeletal muscle\n      vasodilation, sympathetic activation, and vascular oxidative stress have not been assessed\n      in humans.\n\n      The investigators will collect venous endothelial cells, and measure skeletal muscle\n      microvascular perfusion using Octafluoropropane microbubble contrast agents, and measure\n      sympathetic nerve activity in normotensive controls (NT), stage 1 essential hypertensive\n      subjects (ET), and patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) during hyperinsulinemic\n      euglycemic clamp."
