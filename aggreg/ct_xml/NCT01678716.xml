  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation uses a cluster-randomized design where 20 geographic clusters (subdistricts)
      were randomized to allocate them to comparison area, MNP-only area, Behavior Change
      Communication (BCC)-only area and MNP+BCC areas.  The design uses a repeated cross-sectional
      design, where a community-based random sample of children 6-59.9 months old was surveyed at
      baseline (April-June 2010).  Children 6.23.9 months of age will be surveyed at endline for
      the MNP intervention in April-June 2013 and for the MNP + BCC intervention in April-June
      2014. The impact evaluation design enables the following comparisons: 1) double-difference
      intent-to-treat estimates of public health impact on anemia, iron deficiency and vitamin A
      deficiency among the population of children 6-11.9 months of age; 2) end-line only
      intent-to-treat comparisons of children in each of the intervention arms with the comparison
      arm; 3) additional analyses of impact on the treated, by levels of exposure, among the MNP
      arms. Stunting will be assessed using before-after intervention-comparison group differences
      between 2010 and 2014.  Infant feeding practices will be assessed using before-after
      intervention-comparison area group differences between 2010, and 2013 and 2014.

      In addition, the investigators will evaluate the processes through which the BCC and MNP
      programs roll out using a mix of qualitative and quantitative research methods.  Qualitative
      research methods will help to understand drivers of promotion and sales of MNPs by frontline
      health workers, as well as household level determinants and dynamics related to enabling
      purchase and use of the MNP and adhering to behavioral recommendations. Quantitative surveys
      of frontline health workers will help document their awareness about IYCF, MNPs, training,
      and sales, while quantitative surveys of the households will help document household level
      awareness, purchase and use of MNPs and awareness and adherence to IYCF practices for
      children in the target age range.
