Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy plus steroid therapy is more\n      effective for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of\n      combination chemotherapy plus steroid therapy in treating children who have acute\n      lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
