  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to further characterize the safety and immunogenicity of Menactra®
      in the population &lt; 2 years of age when administered alone and when the second dose is
      administered concomitantly with the 4th dose of Pentacel®, a licensed pediatric vaccine.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate and compare the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and
           W 135 induced by 2 injections of Menactra® in subjects aged 9 months at the first
           vaccination visit and 15 to 18 months at the second vaccination visit.

        -  To evaluate and compare the antibody responses to pertussis (pertussis toxoid [PT],
           filamentous haemagglutinin [FHA] and pertactin [PRN]) antigens induced by a dose of
           Pentacel® when administered concomitantly with Menactra® to those elicited by a dose of
           Pentacel® administered alone.

        -  To evaluate and compare the antibody responses to polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP),
           tetanus and diphtheria antigens induced by a dose of Pentacel® when administered
           concomitantly with Menactra® to those elicited by a dose of Pentacel® alone.

      Observational Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety profile (immediate unsolicited AEs within 30 minutes of each
           trial vaccination, solicited reactions within 7 days of each vaccination, unsolicited
           AEs within 30 days of each vaccination, and serious adverse events [SAEs] throughout
           the course of the trial from Day 0 up to Day 30 after the last trial vaccination[s]) in
           all trial groups

        -  To describe the antibody responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135,
           measured by SBA HC, 30 days after the second Menactra® administration

        -  To describe the antibody responses to Pentacel® (PT, FHA, PRN, FIM, diphtheria,
           tetanus, polio, PRP) measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
           radioimmunoassay (RIA), or functional assays.
