Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 5 courses.\n\n      After completion of the fifth course, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and\n      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, and G-CSF SC daily\n      on days 6-17. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for 4 courses.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 3\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional\n      patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for phase I and a maximum of 10\n      patients will be accrued for phase II within 2-3 years."
