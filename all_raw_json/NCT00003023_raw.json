The vaccine is injected intradermally in multiple\n      sites. Booster immunizations are administered during weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52.\n      Immunizations are not administered in limbs where draining lymph nodes have been surgically\n      removed or previously irradiated. Isoniazid is administered for 5 days after each BCG\n      injection. If severe skin reactions are present at the injection site, the BCG dose is\n      decreased. If skin reactions persist, the BCG dose is stopped but A1G4 injections continue.\n\n      At least 6 patients are accrued at each dose level of A1G4. Dose escalation is not carried\n      out until patients have been followed for at least 8 weeks after the first immunization\n      without encountering grade 3 or worse non-skin toxicity.\n\n      If 0-1 patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a given dose level, then patients\n      are accrued to the next higher dose level. If 2 or more patients experience DLT, the MTD is\n      defined as the previous dose level.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients are expected to complete this study. If patients\n      are removed early from the study prior to evaluation for serological response, additional\n      patients will be accrued until 6 patients are evaluable for serological response."
