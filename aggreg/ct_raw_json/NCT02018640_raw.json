            "textblock": "Developing effective tobacco cessation interventions during pregnancy for American Indian\n      and Alaska Native people is a national priority and will contribute to the U.S. public\n      health objective of reducing tobacco-related cancer health disparities. The proposed project\n      builds on our successful partnership with the Alaska Native community and previous work with\n      Alaska Native pregnant women. We propose to develop and test a novel biomarker feedback\n      intervention relating cotinine levels in the urine of pregnant women with the woman and\n      infant's likely exposure to the tobacco specific nitrosamine and carcinogen\n      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK). This 5-year project will be conducted\n      in three phases. In Phase 1 we utilized a non-randomized, clinical observational trial to\n      examine biomarkers of nicotine and carcinogen exposure (urine cotinine and total NNAL [a\n      metabolite of NNK], respectively) among maternal-infant pairs with assessments conducted\n      during pregnancy and at delivery. In Phase 2, we will obtain qualitative feedback on the\n      findings from Phase 1 through individual interviews conducted with women who use tobacco and\n      a confidant (partner/friend/relative) they have identified to develop the biomarker feedback\n      intervention messages. Phase 3 will consist of a formative evaluation of the biomarker\n      feedback intervention with  pregnant women using a two-group randomized design to assess the\n      intervention's feasibility and acceptability, and the biochemically confirmed abstinence\n      rate at the end of pregnancy. All phases of the project will be guided by a Community\n      Advisory Committee. Each phase is an important step to advance our understanding of the\n      potential for biomarker feedback as a strategy to help Alaska Native pregnant women quit\n      tobacco use. The potential reach of the intervention is significant from a public health\n      perspective as over 600 tobacco users deliver each year at the Alaska Native Medical Center\n      in Anchorage where the proposed project will take place. Developing effective interventions\n      for tobacco cessation during pregnancy is important to reduce adverse health consequences\n      for the mother and neonate and future risk of tobacco-caused cancers."
