    <textblock>
      The Initiate and Maintain Physical Activity in Clinics (IMPACT) study will determine the
      optimal and feasible level of frequency of structured contact needed in a clinical setting
      for adult patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus to initiate and maintain physical activity
      recommendations long-term.

    <description>Participants in the Once Weekly Structured Contact group will take part in an 6-month exercise intervention and attend one structured group exercise session per week. They will engage in aerobic and resistance training for approximately 80 minutes per exercise session. Additionally, they will attend three exercise evaluations and six study visits.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Thrice-Weekly Structured Contact group will take part in an 6-month exercise intervention and attend three structured group exercise sessions per week. In total, they will engage in aerobic and resistance training sessions for approximately 200 minutes per week. Additionally, they will attend three exercise evaluations and six study visits.</description>

    <intervention_name>Structured Group Exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>The study intervention is a 6-month exercise program with structured group sessions conducted in a clinical setting. Group sessions include Aerobic Training and Combined Training. Once-Weekly participants will attend one Combined Training session while thrice-weekly participants will attend two Combined Training sessions and one Aerobic Training session per week. Participants in both groups will attend three exercise evaluations during the intervention period. Participants will also use provided logs to track their daily exercise activities outside of group sessions. Physical activity will be assessed by group session attendance, exercise resistance and intensity, and exercise frequency data collected from exercise logs, surveys, and evaluations.</description>
