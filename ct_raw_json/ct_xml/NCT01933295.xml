  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is recognized as the most prevalent and &quot;costly&quot; sleep disorders and is associated
      with considerable morbidity including significantly reduced quality of life, impaired work
      performance, and increased risk for major depressive disorder.1-4  Insomnia is a key symptom
      of the menopausal transition. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) yields
      equivalent short-term efficacy and superior long-term durability to pharmacological
      treatment of insomnia.  The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia comorbid
      with menopause will be tested.

    <description>Subjects will be evaluated at pre treatment, post treatment and at approximately 6 months follow up. A total of 4 standarized nocturnal PSGs will be performed for each participant (screening night, baseline assessment, and post-treatment night 1 and post treatment night 2. For each participant, self report sleep diaries will be measured in the home nightly throughout the 2-week baseline, treatment protocols, during the 2 weeks immediately post-treatment and for 2 weeks during follow up assessment at 6 months post treatment.</description>
