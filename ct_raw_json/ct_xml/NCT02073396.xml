  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased
      risk of stroke and heart attack. Such events are usually caused by increased stickiness of
      the blood causing a blood clot to block the artery (thrombus) in the heart or the brain. The
      aim of this study is to assess the stickiness of the blood (global thrombotic status) in
      patients with CAD and AF at baseline and after clinical stabilisation to see how disease
      state and clinical treatments affect the stickiness of the blood (thrombotic status). This
      will be a single centre study. Patients diagnosed with CAD or AF will have a blood sample
      taken at baseline and after clinical stabilisation. Blood stickiness will be tested with the
      Global Thrombosis Test. The results will be evaluated to assess the effect of disease
      process and clinical state on blood stickiness to gain further understanding of this
      condition and form the basis for future studies aimed at identifying patients who are at
      high risk of future cardiovascular events, based on increased blood stickiness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impaired thrombotic status is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of
      thrombotic events. It is not known whether thrombotic status differs in these patients, or
      how thrombotic status alters in response to clinical stabilisation with treatment.

      The aim of this study is to assess the global thrombotic status (stickiness of the blood) in
      patients with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation at baseline and after clinical
      stabilisation.

      This is a small, pilot, hypothesis-generating study. Design Single centre,
      hypothesis-generating study. Patients diagnosed with coronary disease (n=70) or atrial
      fibrillation (n=70) recruited from amongst in-patients or out-patients, will have a blood
      draw at presentation and after clinical stabilisation. Blood will be tested to assess global
      thrombotic status.

      The recruitment period is 3 years.

          1. Male and female participants aged &lt; 18 years of age.

          2. Patients with impaired renal function eGFR &lt;30 ml/min (since renal failure is
             associated with platelet function defect that may confound results).

             of high alcohol levels on platelet reactivity.

          6. Any illness deemed significant by the investigator during the four (4) weeks
