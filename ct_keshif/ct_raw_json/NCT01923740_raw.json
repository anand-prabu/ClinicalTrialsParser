Subject has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath\n             insertion. Note: femoral arterial disease does not exclude the subject if radial or\n             brachial access can be used.\n\n         22. Subject has life expectancy < 2 years for any non-cardiac cause or cardiac cause.\n\n         23. Subject is in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, unable to comply with the\n             requirements of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason.\n\n         24. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet\n             completed its primary endpoint or protocol-required medications or invasive\n             procedures.\n\n        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria\n\n        Assessment of angiographic eligibility is per visual assessment by an investigator both\n        for qualitative and quantitative variables. On-line QCA is recommended to be used for\n        appropriately sizing of the vessel. If on-line QCA cannot be used, visual estimation is\n        required.\n\n          1. One or two de novo target lesions:\n\n               1. If there is one target lesion, a second non-target lesion may be treated but the\n                  non-target lesion must be present in a different epicardial vessel, and must be\n                  treated first with a successful, uncomplicated result prior to randomization of\n                  the target lesion.\n\n               2. If two target lesions are present, they must be present in different epicardial\n                  vessels and both satisfy the angiographic eligibility criteria.\n\n               3. The definition of epicardial vessels means the left anterior descending artery\n                  (LAD), the left circumflex artery (LCX), and the right coronary artery (RCA) and\n                  their branches. Thus, for example, the subject must not have lesions requiring\n                  treatment in both the LAD and a diagonal branch.\n\n          2. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated\n             or quantitatively assessed %DS of  \u2265 50% and < 100% with a TIMI flow of \u2265 1 and one\n             of the following: stenosis \u2265 70%, an abnormal functional test (e.g., fractional flow\n             reserve, stress test), unstable angina or post-infarct angina.\n\n          3. Target lesion must have a Dmax (by on-line QCA) or RVD (by visual estimation) \u2265 2.50\n             mm and \u2264 3.75 mm (on-line QCA assessment is recommended).\n\n          4. Target lesion must have a lesion length \u2264 24 mm based on either visual estimation or\n             on-line QCA.\n\n        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria\n\n        All exclusion criteria apply to the target lesion(s) or target vessel(s). All exclusion\n        criteria are based on visual estimation.\n\n          1. Target lesion is located in left main.\n\n          2. Aorto-ostial RCA target lesion (within 3 mm of the ostium).\n\n          3. Target lesion located within 3 mm of the origin of the LAD or LCX.\n\n          4. Lesion involving a bifurcation with a:\n\n               1. Side branch \u2265 2 mm in diameter, or\n\n               2. Side branch with diameter stenosis \u2265 50%, or\n\n               3. Side branch requiring protection guide wire, or\n\n               4. Side branch requiring pre-dilatation\n\n          5. Anatomy proximal to or within the lesion that may impair delivery of the Absorb BVS\n             or XIENCE V, including:\n\n               1. Extreme angulation (\u2265 90\u00b0) proximal to or within the target lesion\n\n               2. Excessive tortuosity (\u2265 two 45\u00b0 angles) proximal to or within the  target lesion\n\n               3. Moderate or heavy calcification proximal to or within the target lesion\n\n          6. Target lesion or target vessel involves a myocardial bridge.\n\n          7. Target vessel contains thrombus as indicated in the angiographic images.\n\n          8. Target vessel has been previously treated with a stent at any time prior to the index\n             procedure such that the Absorb BVS or XIENCE V would need to cross the stent to reach\n             the target lesion.\n\n          9. Target vessel has been previously treated with a stent and the target lesion is\n             within 5 mm proximal to a previously treated lesion.\n\n         10. Target lesion which prevents complete balloon pre-dilatation, defined as full balloon\n             expansion with the following outcomes:\n\n               1. Residual %DS is < 40% (per visual estimation), \u2264 20% is strongly recommended.\n\n               2. TIMI Grade-3 flow (per visual estimation).\n\n               3. No angiographic complications (e.g. distal embolization, side branch closure).\n\n               4. No dissections NHLBI grade D-F.\n\n               5. No chest pain lasting > 5 minutes.\n\n               6. No ST depression or elevation lasting > 5 minutes."
