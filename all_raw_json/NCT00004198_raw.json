Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill\n      tumor cells. Sargramostim may stimulate a person's immune system and help to kill tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus sargramostim\n      following chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma."

Determine the ability of recombinant idiotype immunotherapy to stimulate a\n      specific immune response against the B cell idiotype of the malignant clone that constitutes\n      the tumor in patients with previously untreated stage III or IV indolent non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen using Genitope\n      Corporation's molecular rescue technology in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of oral cyclophosphamide,\n      vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until the maximal\n      clinical response is achieved followed by 2 additional courses of consolidation therapy for\n      up to a maximum of 10 courses. Patients not achieving adequate response receive up to 6\n      courses of alternate chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,\n      and prednisone. At 3 months or up to 1 year following completion of chemotherapy, patients\n      achieving adequate disease response receive vaccination consisting of recombinant tumor\n      derived immunoglobulin idiotype with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ)\n      at 2 sites immediately followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) SQ on day 1. Patients receive\n      GM-CSF alone on days 2-4. Vaccination repeats every 4 weeks for 4 doses, followed 12 weeks\n      later by the fifth and final dose. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6\n      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
