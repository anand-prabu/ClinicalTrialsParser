Poly-ICLC is a potent\n      vaccine adjuvant with broad innate and adaptive immune enhancing effects. IMA 950 and\n      Poly-ICLC will be administered to patients alongside standard primary therapy for\n      glioblastoma. This includes the alkylating drug temozolomide (TMZ). Effective\n      vaccine-induced immune responses associated with prolonged survival have been observed in\n      glioblastoma patients during TMZ adjuvant therapy, suggesting a possible synergistic effect.\n      A second component of glioblastoma standard treatment is external beam irradiation of the\n      tumor site post-surgery. As a side effect, potentially beneficial tumor-infiltrating immune\n      cells may also be killed by radiation. However, the combination of radiation with\n      immunotherapy has been suggested to be favorable both in pre-clinical models."
