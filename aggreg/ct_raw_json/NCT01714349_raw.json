Optimize the efficiency\n      of nerve transfer surgery by evaluating patient outcomes in relation to patient selection\n      and optimal timing the the surgery.  Hypothesis: Peripheral nerve transfers in patients with\n      spinal cord injuries will improve hand function and provide improvement in patient quality\n      of life and functional independence."
