  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this care protocol is to study the effects of scan to help epidural infiltration
      realization, in presumed difficult patients suffering from sciatica.

      These scans are already performed in our Rheumatology Department but our objective is to
      evaluate objectively its contribution for patients and doctors.

      Epidural infiltration in young patients, with an easy anatomical identification, causes
      generally no technical difficulties, therefore this protocol will only include patients
      presumed to have a difficult infiltration, that means those aged more than 60, and/or with
      BMI &gt; 30 and/or suffering from scoliosis.

      This study concerns patients who are hospitalized in Rheumatology Department (Hospital of
      Nantes) for their first epidural infiltration for treatment-resistant lombosciatica.

      Patient will be randomized at Day 0, before infiltration. This latter will be performed in
      accordance to current practice.

      Tolerance data (pain and satisfaction) will be collected just after the infiltration and
      eventual complications will be reported within 48 hours after infiltration.

      Following treatment of lombosciatic will be realized through hospitalization, as usual.

      Scan is a safe, non invasive, painless and non radiating exam. It is the extension of the
      musculoskeletal clinical exam and it has already changed our rheumatology practices. The
      investigators hope at the end of this study, that results would confirm that scan can be a
      help in practice to perform epidural infiltrations.

    <description>Scan will be conducted by the operator performing the gesture. He will examine the lumbar spine from L3 to S1, in longitudinal and cross sections and determine the best surgical approach. This will be defined by the largest interspinous space or better visibility of the epidural space. The depth of the epidural space will be noted. The selected stage will be marked with a skin pen to facilitate its location thereafter</description>
