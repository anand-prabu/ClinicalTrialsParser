  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of telbivudine at a dose of 20
      mg/kg up to a maximum of 600 mg q.d. in compensated pediatric HBeAg-positive and negative
      CHB patients aged 2 to &lt;18 years with the indication of antiviral CHB treatment. This study
      is part of the commitments of the pediatric development plan for telbivudine in Europe and
      US.

    <description>A population pharmacokinetic (population PK) study will be performed using a sparse sampling technique for all patients in the LDT600 treatment group. These sparse samples will be used together with the existing extensive sampling pharmacokinetic data from Phase I study to build a population PK model in pediatric patients. The objectives for performing the population PK assessments are to characterize LDT600 PK profiles and estimate exposure (e.g. AUC, Cmax and Cmin) at the steady-state among different age and disease groups of children as compared to adults.</description>
