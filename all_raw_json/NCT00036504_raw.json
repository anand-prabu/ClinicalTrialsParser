One group will receive 4 months of insulin lispro LM administered immediately\n      before the morning and evening meals plus metformin two or three times daily followed by 4\n      months of a once-daily long acting insulin comparator at bedtime plus metformin two or three\n      times daily.  The other group will receive the reverse sequence."
