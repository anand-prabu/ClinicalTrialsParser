      Objective: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of TENS and Electromagnetic therapy
      treatment, both mixed with Back School, in senior women with chronic low back pain (LBP).

      Design: Single-blind experimental prospective study of clinic intervention.
      Subjects/Patients: 16 over-60-aged women with a chronic low back pathology. Methods:
      Subjects have been divided into 2 groups: TENS and Back School or Electromagnetic therapy
      and Back School. They have received 20 sessions of treatment. Treatment efficacy was
      evaluated at the end of treatment, in terms of pain, measured with the Visual Analogue
      Scale. Anthropometric and physical activity variables have been collected from the clinical
      story and with physical activity fast sorter.

    <measure>Pain was measured at the beginning and after the treatment with the Visual Scale Analogue (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The VAS scale represents the pain intensity on a line of 10 cm, at one end there are the words &quot;no pain&quot; and the other end &quot;the worst imaginable pain &quot; written, the distance in centimetres from the &quot;no pain&quot; point to the place marked by the patient represents the intensity of pain</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire of Physical Activity (ClassAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Is a method developed by the Health Department of the Catalan Government. The ClassAf is a comprehensive questionnaire which contains a few items (1-4) to measure the general level of Physical Activity, it is calculated in METS (basal metabolic expenditure: mlO2/kg.min) and it allows to classify people into physically active or physically inactive.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>On the basis of BMI (kg/m2), subjects were classified as Obesity (BMI over 30), overweight (BMI between 25 and 29.9) or normal weight (BMI between 18.5 and 24.9).</description>

    <description>20 sessions from Monday to Friday of 20 minutes of Electromagnetic Therapy, using the next parameters: 10 Hz of frequency and 60% of intensity, and 20 sessions from Monday to Friday of 25 minutes of Back School, the exercises were based on the re-education of breathing, self stretching trunk muscles, erector spine reinforcement, abdominal reinforcement and postural exercises. The participants had been performing 8 to 10 repetitions of each exercise and they had been recommended about making a series more at home.</description>
