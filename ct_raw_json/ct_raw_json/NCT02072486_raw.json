Sorafenib tosylate may block some of the enzymes needed for\n      tumor cell growth. Blocking these enzymes may also help the immune system work better.\n      Granzyme B is a biomarker that can be used to measure how well the immune system is working.\n      A biomarker is a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a\n      sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease. Studying granzyme B\n      levels in patients receiving sorafenib tosylate may help doctors learn more about the\n      effects of sorafenib tosylate on the immune system and may help to predict how well\n      sorafenib tosylate will work in treating patients with liver cancer."

To determine whether the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that are producing\n      granzyme B (denoted pGrzB) as measured ~28-35 days after initiation of sorafenib (sorafenib\n      tosylate) therapy correlates with overall survival, defined as the number of months between\n      the start of sorafenib treatment and death from any cause.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine whether higher pGrzB levels will correlate with better sorafenib tolerance,\n      manifested by fewer dose reductions, dose interruptions and adverse events.\n\n      II. To determine whether improved immune function may also result in greater recognition of\n      hepatitis viral antigens.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days and then periodically\n      thereafter."
