  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of a six-month-long intervention in improving the
      nutrition and physical activity environments of child care centers serving racially and
      ethnically diverse children from birth to two years of age and the family home. The focus of
      the intervention will be on center policies, provider and parent practices, and children's
      home environments that influence dietary intake and physical activity. Outcomes for this
      study include child dietary intake, physical activity, and two adiposity measures:
      weight-for-length and skinfold thicknesses. Child care centers and children's home
      environments will also be measured to evaluate how well they support healthy behaviors.

    <description>The Back to Sleep arm will encourage safe sleep practices to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in child care and at home. This include:
center and family self-assessment,
center intervention materials delivered several times over the 6-month period, and;
parent handouts
After the intervention period, comparator centers will receive an abbreviated version of the Baby NAP SACC intervention.</description>

    <description>The intervention will include four complementary and mutually reinforcing components:
center and family self-assessment;
targeted technical assistance by Baby NAP SACC consultant for providers and parents;
training workshops for child care providers; and
parent outreach and support.</description>
