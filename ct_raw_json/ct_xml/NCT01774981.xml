      The purpose of this two-part study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy
      of LY3016859 after multiple intravenous (IV) dosing's in participants with diabetic
      nephropathy (DN).  Part A will be dose escalation for safety and tolerability and Part B
      will evaluate Proteinuria.
