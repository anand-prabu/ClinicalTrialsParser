  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for subjects with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The purpose of this research
      study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Folfirinox and radiation therapy as
      treatment for adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the pancreas before surgery. Screening tests will
      be done to determine if subjects are eligible for participation in this study. If subjects
      are eligible to participate and agree to participate they will begin chemotherapy. After 3
      cycles of chemotherapy, subjects will begin chemoradiation. Within 4 to 8 weeks of
      completing radiation therapy, subjects will have surgery. There will also be post-treatment
      and follow-up evaluations. Subjects will be followed for every 3 months for 3 years after
      their initial registration.

    <description>We will estimate the R0/R1 resection rate as the proportion of patients with R0 or R1 resection status based on the ITT population.  Any patient for whom a surgical sample is not available will be considered a failure (that is, such patients will be counted in the denominator of the estimated proportion, but will contribute a 0 to its numerator).  We will also construct exact binomial 95% CIs to provide a measure of the estimated R0/R1 resection rate's precision.</description>

    <description>Radiographic tumor response:
The rate of CR, PR, SD and PD will be estimated as described in Section 14B prior to chemoradiation start and prior to surgery.  The analysis population for estimation of radiographic response rate will be the ITT population.  In addition, ORR (= CR + PR) will be estimated along with corresponding exact 95% CIs.</description>

    <description>Histopathologic tumor response:
We will estimate the rate of good histopathologic response as the proportion of grade I and II responders.  The analysis population for this objective is the ITT population.  Any patient for whom a surgical sample is not available will be considered a poor-responder.  We will also construct exact binomial 95% CIs to provide a measure of the estimated response rate's precision.  We will also construct point and interval estimates of the rate of poor response.  All pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens will be independently reviewed by both Dr. Lewin and Dr. Sun to assess histopathologic response.  Should independent evaluations of response differ, Drs. Lewin and Sun will confer to arrive at a consensus evaluation.</description>

    <description>Time to recurrence:
Time to recurrence will be assessed graphically, and the median TTR will be estimated based on the resulting Kaplan Meier curve.  An exponential Greenwood 95% CI will be constructed corresponding to the median TTR.  The analysis population for estimation of median TTR will be the surgical population (recurrence is defined only among those patients who are resected with curative intent).  Additionally, we will estimate median TTR separately for subpopulations of surgical patients with R0 and R1 resection status.</description>

    <description>Overall survival:
Median OS and corresponding 95% CI will be estimated as described in Section 14E.  The analysis population for estimation of median OS will be the ITT population.  As described in Section 7, all patients will be followed until death or three years after initial registration, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>For each of the 42 sphingome genes, ΔCt will be measured in duplicate for each patient sample and averaged. For each gene, we will summarize central tendency and dispersion for patients with R0/R1 resection status and those patients not achieving R0/R1 resection status using descriptive measures including mean, median, SD, inter-quartile range and range. We will construct boxplots with overlayed jittered data points to graphically assess differences in gene expression. If the data are not too sparse, we will examine the predictive potential of sphingome genes by conducting simple logistic regressions of the log odds of R0/R1 resection on average ΔCt for each gene of interest, and estimate the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve.</description>

             to Day 1 of treatment in this study.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation for pancreatic cancer.

          -  Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drugs.

             chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

          -  Patients must not require chronic use of immunosuppressive agents (e.g. methotrexate,
             cyclosporine).

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or
             any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for five years.

          -  Patients must not have clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including
             myocardial infarction, unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, serious
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia) &lt; 1 year before randomization.

          -  Patients must not have a history of any medical or psychiatric condition or
             laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risks
             associated with the study participation or investigational product(s) administration
             or may interfere with the interpretation of the results.

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures.

          -  Patient is enrolled in any other therapeutic clinical protocol or investigational
             trial.

          -  Patients aged ≥ 80 are not excluded. However, candidates in this age group should be
             thoroughly evaluated before enrollment in the study, to ensure they are fit to
             receive chemotherapy, and to potentially undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy. In addition
             to meeting all of the baseline patient selection criteria, clinical judgment
             regarding the patient's susceptibility to infection, expected stability of their
             performance status, and suitability to receive intensive chemotherapy cycles should
             be paid special attention. Patients should not be enrolled in the study should there
             be any hesitation on any of these considerations. Baseline criteria for all patients
             enrolled on the study must be carefully evaluated and all criteria followed
             appropriately.
