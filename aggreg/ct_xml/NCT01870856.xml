  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of contact lens lubricity on lid wiper
      epitheliopathy in symptomatic contact lens wearers. Lid wiper epitheliopathy is defined as
      an alteration of that portion of the marginal conjunctival epithelium of the upper eyelid
      that wipes the ocular surface during blinking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two stages. In Stage 1, participants will wear either
      spectacles or contact lenses for two weeks to determine the impact of interruption of
      contact lens wear on lid wiper epitheliopathy. In Stage 2, a second cohort of participants
      will wear one of two contact lens brands for two weeks, and lid wiper epitheliopathy and
      ocular discomfort will be compared.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) will be measured by slit lamp evaluation of fluorescein and lissamine green staining to the tissue that lines the margin of the inside of the upper eyelid. LWE will be graded on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0=none and 3=severe. The percent of eyes experiencing at least a 1 grade reduction in LWE (from baseline) at the 2-week visit will be compared between groups.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 2</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SPEED questionnaire contains frequency (scale 0 to 3) and severity (scale 0 to 3) reported for the following four symptoms: dryness, grittiness/scratchiness, soreness/ irritation, and burning/watering. The SPEED score is derived as the summation over both the frequency and severity of all four symptoms, with resultant overall value 0 to 24, where 0=no ocular discomfort and 24=maximum ocular discomfort. Since the questionnaire is collected binocularly, the concept of study eye is not relevant.</description>
