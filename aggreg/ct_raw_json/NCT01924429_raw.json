Participants may qualify\n      for participation in this study because they have ADHD and are willing to participate in two\n      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans and receive Vyvanse for treatment of\n      their symptoms.  Another purpose of this study is to collect and bank samples of blood for\n      research to examine how genes influence brain activation seen during the brain scans.  The\n      study also seeks to find out whether certain genes are related to ADHD. Participants' entire\n      genetic makeup will not be determined from this sample."
