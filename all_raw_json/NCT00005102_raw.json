Determine the pattern of immunologic reconstitution in patients with T-cell compromise\n      due to DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome.\n\n      II.

These analyses are repeated at 4 months\n      along with a quantitative analysis of immunoglobulin.\n\n      At 8 months, patients are tested for their lymphocytes' ability to respond to antigens\n      (candida, tetanus, and diphtheria).  At 1 year, patients have lymphocyte subset, IgG, IgA,\n      and IgM analyses performed.  Quantitative evaluations of antibody titers to diphtheria,\n      tetanus, Haemophilus influenza, and hepatitis B are also performed.\n\n      Over 1 year of age, all studies are performed if the patient is seen for a single visit."
