In the past, most studies that examined\n      wasting treatments were limited to men.  However, it appears that wasting in HIV-positive\n      men is linked to levels of testosterone (a hormone which affects men's bodies more than\n      women's).  This study has been designed for women only, in order to best treat wasting in\n      HIV-positive women."

Although multicenter trials of\n      megestrol acetate, dronabinol and growth hormone have not specifically excluded women, women\n      have generally been underrepresented in these trials. This study hopes to generate data that\n      will be substantial enough to perform an analysis that might determine whether there are\n      gender-based differences in anabolic potential.\n\n      Patients will be randomized to receive either nandrolone decanoate or placebo every 2 weeks\n      for 12 weeks of the study. All patients who complete the first 12 weeks of the study will be\n      eligible to receive open-label nandrolone for the subsequent 12 weeks."
