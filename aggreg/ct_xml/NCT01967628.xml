  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most individuals, the lung has a remarkable ability to deal with exposure to a variety
      of inhaled bacteria. Some individuals, however, do have recurrent bacterial infections,
      usually in the form of acute or chronic bronchitis and, in some instances, pneumonia. The
      reasons for this variability in bacterial infections between otherwise healthy subjects,
      between types of lung disease, and within the same type of lung disease are poorly
      understood.

      Variability in susceptibility to bacterial infections is partially explained by differences
      in exposure to infectious agents, genetic susceptibility and innate (or early) immune
      responses. It is of interest that the incidence and severity of bacterial infections is
      greatest during the winter months. Other than viral infections, there are few variables that
      change with season. Vitamin D is one known immune modulator with a seasonal periodicity. The
      hypothesis of this study is that levels of vitamin D are an important determinant of the
      innate defense of the lung against inhaled bacteria. The investigators further postulate
      that vitamin D has effects on the innate immune function of both alveolar macrophages and
      lung epithelial cells.
