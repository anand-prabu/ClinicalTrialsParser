Agitation is a state of extreme emotional disturbance\n      where patients can become physically aggressive or violent, endangering themselves and those\n      who are caring for them.  Often chemical substances or severe mental illness is involved in\n      this level of agitation. Specifically, the investigators are interested in studying\n      agitation that is treated in the prehospital setting by paramedics. This study's hypothesis\n      is that ketamine is superior to haloperidol for treatment of agitation in the prehospital\n      environment."
