The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether people with high mucosal IgA\n           antibodies against flu have a lower immune response to the seasonal LAIV.\n\n        2. The secondary objective is to determine whether the nasal wash viral neutralization\n           data predicts LAIV immunization failures."
