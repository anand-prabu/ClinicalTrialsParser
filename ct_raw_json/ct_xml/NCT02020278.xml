      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the post-treatment safety, long-term treatment and
      repeat treatment of children and adolescent subjects with euvolemic or hypervolemic
      hyponatremia who have previously participated in a trial of oral Tolvaptan.

    <description>Subjects must have been off of treatment with tolvaptan for a minimum of 7 days following the end of treatment in the previous trial to assess the subject's clinical need for treatment with tolvaptan.  The duration of administration of tolvaptan will be per medical need as determined by the Principal Investigator.  Subjects may have short-term treatment (ie, a few days of treatment needed per episode of hyponatremia) or long-term treatment (ie, treatment for weeks to months with concomitant medication).  All subjects will be followed for 6 months regardless of the need for treatment. Subjects can be treated with tolvaptan during and/or after the initial 6-month follow-up period.</description>
