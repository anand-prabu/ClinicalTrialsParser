A followup period of 12 months is included.  The effect on\n      service utilization and the cost of the addition of naltrexone to treatment services for\n      alcohol dependence also will be assessed. The study will expand existing research concerning\n      the effectiveness of naltrexone in clinical trials versus a clinical setting."
