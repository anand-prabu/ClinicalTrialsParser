            "textblock": "It is reported that more than 90,000 patients died of lung cancer and more than 20% of them\n      were older than 80 years in North America. Therefore a less invasive but effective treatment\n      is required for patients with lung cancer of advanced age, diminished pulmonary functions,\n      and chronic diseases. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an effective and\n      well-tolerated treatment for early stage lung cancer in medically inoperable patients. On\n      the other hand, accurate mediastinal and hilar lymph node staging is one of the most\n      important factors that determine the outcome and indications for SBRT. Endobronchial\n      ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a novel, minimally\n      invasive modality that enables the assessment of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with a\n      high sensitivity. Accurate lymph node staging by EBUS-TBNA will allow opportunities for\n      high-risk patients with lung cancer to undergo minimally invasive treatment."

Patients will udergo computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography\n      (PET) prior to EBUS- TBNA. EBUS-TBNA will be performed at the Interventional Thoracic\n      Surgery Suite (ITSS) located at Toronto General Hospital by a Thoracic Surgeon. The\n      procedure will be performed under local anesthesia with conscious sedation. Mediastinal as\n      well as hilar lymph nodes will be assessed by EBUS-TBNA. The result of pathological\n      diagnosis using EBUS-TBNA will be compared with the result of radiological staging (CT and\n      PET-CT).
