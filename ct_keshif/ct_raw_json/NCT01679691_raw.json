It is a well-known effect of\n      epidural injections to cause a sympathetic stimulation and consequently vasodilatation in\n      the lower limb vessels.\n\n      Since epidural catheters can cause vasodilatation in lower limb vessels, they can\n      subsequently lead to increased intra and post-operative bleeding from the surgical wound.\n\n      The study will involve all patients having a bone tumor in the lower limb and subjected to\n      tumor resection and reconstruction by prosthesis.\n\n      The patient will be randomized according to the administration of epidural anesthesia into\n      two arms, an arm in which epidural anesthesia was employed and another arm in which the\n      patient was subjected only to general anesthesia and the amount of intra and postoperative\n      bleeding will be compared in both arms."
