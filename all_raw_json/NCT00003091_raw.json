Determine the toxic effects of interferon alfa-2b and interleukin-2 in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b on\n      days 1-4. Patients are hospitalized and receive bolus infusions of interleukin-2 (IL-2)\n      followed by a continuous infusion on days 5-7. Patients are observed at least 12 hours\n      following IL-2 treatment. Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks until disease progression or\n      up to a maximum of six cycles. Patients are followed every 2 months for one year, then for\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If at least 1 response is seen in the first 14 patients in each group, a\n      maximum of 40 patients per group will be accrued."
