            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the activity of interleukin-12 as defined by the percentage of\n      patients who have not progressed after 6 months of therapy. II. Compare percentage of\n      patients who have not progressed after six months with or without treatment regimen. III.\n      Determine time to progression and overall survival in this patient population after this\n      treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease free\n      interval from primary diagnosis to first metastases (less than 3 years vs 3 years and\n      longer), estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative), and disease status (complete\n      response, partial response, detectable disease, or stable disease). Patients are randomized\n      to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients begin therapy no sooner than 3 weeks and no\n      later than 6 weeks since last chemotherapy dose. Patients receive interleukin-12\n      subcutaneously twice a week. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1 year. If no\n      progression after 1 year, may be followed as needed for new signs or symptoms and survival\n      for 5 years. Arm II: Patients are observed for 6 months. If disease progresses during first\n      6 months, patients may receive interleukin-12 as in arm I. Patients without disease\n      progression within first 6 months may also then receive interleukin-12 as in arm I.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      are followed for toxicity only until interleukin-12 is discontinued.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients (46 per arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      8 months."
