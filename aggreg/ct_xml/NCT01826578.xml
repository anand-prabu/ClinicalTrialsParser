      This study is about the evaluation of which benefits single port laparoscopic myomectomy has
      in the perspective of cosmetics and patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There were several studies about feasibility and cosmetic benefit of single port
      laparoscopic adnexal surgery and hysterectomy compared to conventional multiport
      laparoscopic surgery. Meanwhile, no study mentioned benefit of single port laparoscopic
      surgery in myomectomy because single port myomectomy needs more labor and operator's skill
      than other pelvic surgery. At this point, the investigators need to verify the effectiveness
      and benefit of single port laparoscopic myomectomy.
