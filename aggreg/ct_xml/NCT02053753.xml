  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 140 male and female healthy subjects will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive
      a 120 mg single dose of denosumab either as a 1.7 mL single injection of 70 mg/mL denosumab
      CP4 (Treatment A) or as a 1.7 mL single injection of 70 mg/mL denosumab CP2 (Treatment B).
      Subjects will be admitted to the research facility on day -1 and remain in the research
      facility through day 2. The subjects will return to the research facility on an outpatient
      basis. The PK, PD, and safety assessments will be conducted during the inpatient stay and at
      regular intervals during the 18-week treatment period.

             chemistry, urinalysis) and no history or evidence of any clinically significant
             medical disorder that would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with study
             evaluations or procedures

          -  Normal or clinically acceptable electrocardiogram (ECG) (12-lead reporting heart rate
             and PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals) at screening

          -  Willing to be confined to the research facility for 2 consecutive nights

          -  Subject will be available for follow-up assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Prior diagnosis of bone disease, or any condition that will affect bone metabolism such
        as, but not limited to: osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, hyperparathyroidism,
        hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, osteomalacia, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis,
        ankylosing spondylitis, current flare-up of osteoarthritis and/or gout, active malignancy,
        renal disease (defined as glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt; 45 mL/min), Paget's disease
        of the bone, recent bone fracture (within 6 months), malabsorption syndrome

          -  Presents with any psychiatric disorder, which may prevent the subject from completing
             the study or interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          -  Significant changes in physical activity during the 6 months before study drug
             administration or constant levels of intense physical exercise

          -  Prior use of any non-Amgen approved medications within 4 weeks or 5-half lives
             (whichever time period is longer) of study drug administration and for the duration
             of the study. This includes medications such as, but not limited to: bisphosphonates,
             fluoride, hormone replacement therapy (ie, estrogen) or selective estrogen receptor
             modulator, such as ralaxofene, calcitonin, strontium, parathyroid hormone or

             comply with study procedures

          -  Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) or risk factors for ONJ such as invasive dental
             procedures (eg, tooth extraction, dental implants, oral surgery in the past 6
