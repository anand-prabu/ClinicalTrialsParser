Each participant will receive two injections on the abdomen with\n      different pH. After each injection, the subject will be asked to evaluate the pain on a\n      Visual analog scale (0-100 mm). It is anticipated that the pain decreases with increasing\n      pH. The aim of the study is to find a simple method for pain reduction that can be used in\n      clinical practice."
