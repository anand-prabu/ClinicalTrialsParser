However, transplant is often complicated by inflammation, infection and other\n      co-morbidities.  In addition, these disorders have been shown to be cured with partial\n      chimerism, making them an ideal target for the use of reduced intensity approaches, where a\n      portion of patients may not achieve full donor chimerism, but instead achieve stable mixed\n      chimerism.  Reduced-intensity conditioning strategies have demonstrated improved survival\n      with decreased Treatment Related Mortality (TRM) in institutional series for patients with\n      HLH (Cooper et al., 2006; Marsh et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2011).  However, graft loss and\n      unstable chimerism remain challenges.  An institutional case series from Cincinnati\n      Children's Hospital demonstrated full or high-level chimerism and improved durable\n      engraftment using intermediate (Day -14) timing alemtuzumab (Marsh et al., 2013b).  This\n      study aims to test the efficacy of the Intermediate RIC strategy in a prospective\n      multi-center study including HLH as well as other primary immunodeficiencies where\n      allogeneic transplant with RIC has been shown to be feasible and stable chimerism is\n      curative."

The transplant\n      conditioning regimen will include fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab starting at Day\n      -14 (Flu/Mel/Alem).  Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) prophylaxis will consist of\n      cyclosporine and corticosteroids through engraftment.
