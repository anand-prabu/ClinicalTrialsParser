Current study aims to investigate is whether individualized\n      fortification of breast milk protein, based on the mother's milk protein content and\n      targeting the recommended daily protein requirements, is associated with better nutrition,\n      growth, biochemical and endocrine markers associated with the nutrition of preterm low birth\n      weight neonates, compared to the standard fortification of human milk."

            "textblock": "Proteins are of the most importany macromolecules in living organisms participating in\n      almost all biological processes. Premature infants are forced to adapt to a new\n      (extrauterine) environment where supply of nutrients, including amino acids, from mother\n      ceases abruptly.  Consequently, the aim of neonatologist is the appropriate, quantitatively\n      and qualitatively nutritional support, to promote brain development, achieve normal\n      endocrine and metabolic function, maintain a growth rate similar to the intrauterine one\n      avoiding extrauterine growth restriction during postnatal period and at the same time\n      encouraging the analogue modulation of body composition (increased muscle mass, decrease\n      body fat, hydration).\n\n      Malnutrition or inadequate nutrition of preterm infant which remains undiagnosed and without\n      proper treatment could have serious consequences on psychomotor development and metabolic\n      activity. Indeed, 75% of low birth weight premature infants exhibit extrauterine growth\n      restriction at discharge, even when they have achieved growth equal to the considered\n      satisfactory, ie 15g/kg/day.\n\n      Beyond anthropometrics differences between preterm and full-term newborns, body composition\n      varies as well. Preterms have higher percentage of body fat and decreased muscle mass at\n      term time compared with full term neonates. However, it has not been clarified whether this\n      differentiation is harmful predisposing to chronic diseases later in childhood or adult life\n      (eg. obesity, metabolic syndrome)."
