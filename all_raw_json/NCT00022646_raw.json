Giving more than one drug and giving the drugs in different\n      ways may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of three different regimens\n      of pemetrexed disodium plus gemcitabine in treating patients who have locally advanced or\n      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer."

Patients are stratified according to stage\n      of disease (IIIB vs IV) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to one\n      of three treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1 followed by\n           gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by\n           pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and pemetrexed\n           disodium IV over 10 minutes followed by gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8.\n\n      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive up to 6\n      additional courses of therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 20 months."
