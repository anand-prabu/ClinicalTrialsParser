             lens in both eyes

          -  The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

          -  The subject's required spherical contact lens prescription must be in the range of
             -0.50 to -9.00D in each eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will

             wear.

          -  Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, that may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          -  Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of

             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

             Solution.

          -  Any ocular infection.
