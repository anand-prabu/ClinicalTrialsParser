Some location of sarcoidosis may require treatment\n      with corticosteroids or immunosuppressors.Although seasonal influenza vaccination can be\n      recommended in sarcoidosis in some subgroups at risk (respiratory failure, pulmonary\n      fibrosis, age over 65, use of immunosuppressive therapy, etc ...), the investigators\n      presently have no data on the efficacy and safety (absence of adverse reactions) of seasonal\n      influenza vaccination in sarcoidosis.Especially it is not known whether the seasonal\n      influenza vaccine provides the same rate and same type of vaccine response in sarcoidosis\n      patients than in the general population. Similarly, it is unclear whether the vaccine\n      response is modified by the severity of the disease and treatment with corticosteroids and\n      immunosuppressors.Based on what is known in systemic lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, which\n      are both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, the investigators expect at best a 50%\n      vaccine response in patients with sarcoidosis and a 85% vaccination response  in healthy\n      controls. The demonstration of a vaccine response could allow reconsidering new vaccine\n      approaches in sarcoidosis."

            "textblock": "Data on vaccination in sarcoidosis are largely insufficient. It is thus unclear whether the\n      vaccine response is modified according to the clinical phenotype of the disease and/or\n      treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. However, sarcoidosis is accompanied\n      by numerous disturbances of the immune system, including a tendency to anergy which may\n      affect the efficacy of the vaccine, especially when the disease is active and severe. In\n      addition, the tolerance of influenza vaccination in patients with sarcoidosis has not been\n      studied yet.The influenza vaccination in sarcoidosis is a common practice among medical\n      specialists who care for patients with sarcoidosis, either internists or lung specialists..\n      However, the practice of this vaccination is not based on scientific evidence, because there\n      are no data establishing the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination in\n      sarcoidosis.Thus, it is possible that the influenza vaccine is less immunogenic in patients\n      with sarcoidosis than in healthy adults, which may reduce the clinical effectiveness of\n      vaccination. It therefore seems essential to determine the efficacy and safety of this\n      vaccine, which is widely practiced. Poor efficiency could lead to the development of\n      different vaccination strategies, based in particular on the administration of adjuvanted\n      vaccines."
