Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive decreasing doses of irinotecan until the optimal dose is\n      determined. The optimal dose is defined as the dose at which at least 3 of 6 patients show\n      evidence of recruitment of cells into the S phase at 24 hours after irinotecan\n      administration.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
