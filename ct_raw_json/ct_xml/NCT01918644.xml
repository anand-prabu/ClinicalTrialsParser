      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy when given together with capecitabine before surgery in treating patients with
      pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be
      able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving stereotactic
      body radiation therapy and capecitabine before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended-phase-II-dose (RPTD) of stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) at an escalating dose schedule when combined with standard-dose capecitabine as
      neoadjuvant therapy for resectable carcinoma of exocrine pancreas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the incidence of overall 30-day post-operative complications. II. To estimate
      the radiological response rates. III. To estimate the pathological response rates. IV. To
      estimate the rates of resection with negative margins. V. To estimate the recurrence free
      survival (RFS). VI. To estimate the overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES (OPTIONAL):

      I. To define tumor volume (TV), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) pattern and mean apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR)
      imaging (DWI) in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer undergoing neoadjuvant SBRT and
      concomitant chemotherapy (ChT).

      II. To correlate TV, DCE and ADC measurements at baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      versus final pathological response.

      III. To correlate TV, DCE and ADC changes from baseline in MRI done three weeks post-SBRT
      versus final pathological response.

      IV. To predict surgical margin status using MRI done at baseline and at three weeks
      post-SBRT.

      V. To correlate TV, DCE and ADC changes from baseline in MRI done post-3rd fraction at
      baseline versus final pathological response.

      VI. To describe in the biopsy and/ or the surgical specimen, expression of following
      markers: secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) expression; distribution of
      pancreatic stellate cells (PSC); distribution of cluster of differentiation (CD)4+/ CD8+ T
      cell, CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells; other molecular and inflammatory cellular markers may
      be explored.

      VII. To describe changes induced by neoadjuvant therapy by comparison of expression of these
      markers between the biopsy and the surgical specimen.

      VIII. To compare baseline and/ or post-treatment expression with treatment response,
      toxicity and clinical survival outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of SBRT.

      Patients undergo SBRT every other day over 2 weeks for a total of 5 fractions and receive
      capecitabine orally (PO) every 12 hours 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Patients then undergo
      definitive surgery after a minimum of 2 weeks from the completion of SBRT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and 3 months, every
      3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
