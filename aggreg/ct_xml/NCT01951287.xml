  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood sugar and insulin levels after a meal may be altered by the food and beverages a
      person consumes. Keeping a healthy blood sugar level may help prevent and manage type 2
      diabetes and related diseases. This study will look at how drinking different common
      beverages (milk, low-fat milk, nonfat milk, orange juice, coffee, and water) with a meal
      changes blood sugar and insulin levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broad aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the effects of consuming milk and
      non-milk beverages with a breakfast meal on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in
      overweight and obese adults with varying levels of glucose tolerance (normal, pre-diabetic,
      type 2 diabetes). The investigators expect the consumption of fluid milk with breakfast to
      decrease the postprandial glucose response relative to other non-milk beverages (orange
      juice and sweetened coffee). Furthermore, the investigators expect that there will be no
      difference in the postprandial glucose or insulin response between varieties of fluid milk
      (skim, low-fat, and whole).

    <description>Subjects will come to testing once a week for six weeks. Each testing day, subject will come in fasted, and a fasting blood draw will be taken. Subjects will then be fed a standard breakfast with one of the 6 beverages (coffee sweetened with sugar, orange juice, water, whole milk, skim milk, low fat milk). Blood will be taken at 30, 60, 60, 90, 120, 150,180,210,240 minutes after the meal.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be provided with breakfast with one of the six test beverages in a random order on six mornings.
