            "textblock": "This is a Phase I, five arm, single site, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial\n      assessing the safety of tenofovir vaginal gel and film formulations. HIV negative women will\n      be randomized to gel or film, tenofovir or placebo. This study will provide additional\n      information in the evaluation of vaginal films containing microbial agents in humans. In\n      addition to safety, the efficacy of these formulations against HIV in an ex vivo biopsy\n      challenge model will be compared.\n\n      This study is the first study assessing the safety of tenofovir film in humans. Tenofovir\n      film is formulated in a cellulose based vaginal film containing hydroxypropyl methyl\n      cellulose (HPMC) E5 (5 cp), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose\n      (NaCMC), and glycerin. The excipients of the film have documented safety in other clinical\n      settings.\n\n      While the tenofovir film has not been studied extensively in preclinical studies, there are\n      favorable safety data from the macaque study and a substantial body of research with\n      tenofovir gel. It is appropriate to advance the tenofovir film products into a clinical\n      trial for the following reasons:\n\n        -  No safety concerns were note in the tenofovir film macaque trial.\n\n        -  The toxicity of tenofovir administered vaginally has been studied extensively. No\n           clinically significant toxicity associated with this route of administration has been\n           observed to date.\n\n        -  All of the active ingredients of the tenofovir film have been tested in pre-clinical\n           toxicity studies; therefore, the influence of these ingredients on the toxicity profile\n           of tenofovir has been adequately evaluated and has been shown to result in no local or\n           systemic effects.\n\n        -  The individual components of the tenofovir film have been adequately evaluated and have\n           been shown to be safe."

Of note, the study is limited to premenopausal women with an intact uterus\n        because the mucosal immune environment differs substantially between pre- and post-\n        menopausal women. Therefore, inclusion of post-menopausal women would introduce\n        heterogeneity into the population.\n\n          1.

Women who have vaginal\n             bleeding at the scheduled Enrollment Visit may return at a different date to be\n             re-examined and possibly enrolled provided they are still within the screening window\n             and meet all criteria.)*\n\n          8.
