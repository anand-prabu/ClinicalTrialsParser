Combining chemotherapy with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining celecoxib and docetaxel in\n      treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer that has been previously\n      treated with platinum-based chemotherapy."

Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive\n      2 additional courses after CR. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD) or a partial\n      response (PR) receive a minimum of 2 additional courses after SD or PR. At the discretion of\n      the treating physician, patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising celecoxib only.\n\n      Patients who discontinue therapy for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity are\n      followed for at least 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-28\n      months."
