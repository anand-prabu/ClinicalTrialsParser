Demographics\n\n        2. Medical history\n\n        3. Hemodynamic parameter such as Central Venous Pressure (CVP), Mean Arterial Pressure\n           (MAP) , and measurement of superior vena cava (SVC) size by ultrasound.\n\n        4. Laboratory   parameter such as  chemistry, fractional excretion of sodium  , fractional\n           excretion of urea , beta natriuretic peptide , albumin\n\n        5. Radiographic parameters\n\n        6. Echocardiographic parameters including Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), Right\n           Ventricular (RV) function and IVC size and variations\n\n        7. Mechanical ventilation\n\n        8. Daily fluid balance\n\n      Focused bedside ultrasound will be performed for each patient as part of their routine care\n      and initial assessment. The IVC size will be measured at the subcostal window, during\n      inspiration and expiration, using the (Sonosite) Cardiac probe P-21 (5-1 MHZ). The\n      measurement is obtained by applying the M-mode, perpendicular to the IVC axis and 2 cm\n      caudal from its junction with the right atrium.\n\n      In spontaneously breathing, non-ventilated patients, we will calculate the IVC\n      collapsibility index (IVC-CI) = [IVC max-IVC min]/IVC max.\n\n      Whereas in patients who are mechanically ventilated we will calculate their IVC variation\n      index (\u0394IVC) = IVC max-IVC min/ IVC mean diameter.\n\n      IVC-CI, \u0394IVC, IVC size will be used to classify patient as volume responders or\n      non-responder. Prior studies have suggested  Intravascular volume depletion is likely\n      present when the, IVC<1 cm , IVC-CI is > 50% in spontaneously breathing patients  and volume\n      responsiveness when  the \u0394IVC is \u2265 12% in mechanically ventilated patient .\n\n      The Fractional excretion of sodium  as well as the fractional excretion of urea  (when\n      diuretics are used) will be calculated to classify the etiology of the renal failure as\n      pre-renal or intrinsic renal failure.\n\n      Fluid balance as well as the change in plasma Creatinine level at 48 hours post admission\n      will be recorded.\n\n      Two groups of patients will be identified:\n\n        -  Group 1 includes the patients who were managed in concordance with their IVC\n           measurements (Volume responders who had a positive fluid balance at 48 h post admission\n           and volume non responders who had an even or negative fluid balance at 48 hours post\n           admission).\n\n        -  Group 2 includes the patients in whom the fluid management was discordant with the IVC\n           measurement.\n\n      Analyses will be done at 24 as well as 48 hours post admission."
