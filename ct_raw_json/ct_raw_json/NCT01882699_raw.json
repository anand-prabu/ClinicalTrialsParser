In that study,\n      150 insomnia patients were targeted to be randomized to complete in lab assessments of sleep\n      using the Cer\u00eave Sleep System.  In this follow-on study, 36 patients who completed the in\n      lab study will be enrolled to complete 2 phases of in home use of the device.  In the first\n      phase, the durability study, 30 patients are targeted to complete additional in lab\n      assessments following 30 days of in home use of the device.  In the second phase, the home\n      use pattern study, 24 patients are targeted to complete an additional 5 months of in home\n      use in which their use patterns will be monitored.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      EEG sleep latency and sleep efficiency following 30 days in home use of the device at\n      14-16\u00b0C will be similar to those measures after the initial acute, 2-night use in the parent\n      study in the 14-16\u00b0C condition.  The device will demonstrate a benign safety profile over 6\n      months in home use."

It is anticipated that 36\n      subjects will be enrolled into the CIP-004 protocol to obtain the numbers of evaluable\n      subjects described.\n\n      During in home use in both the durability phase and the home use patterns phase, the subject\n      will be asked to use the device for a minimum of three nights each week for at least 4 hours\n      on each of these nights up to seven nights each week.  Subjects will complete a weekly home\n      use log throughout both phases of the study."
