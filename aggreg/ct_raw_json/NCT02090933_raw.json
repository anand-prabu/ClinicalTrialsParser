Quantify changes in the erythema response in human subjects exposed to a range of\n      erythemic doses of solar-simulated ultraviolet light before and after celecoxib treatment.\n\n      II. Collect blood for genetic analysis of markers likely to modulate erythema response. This\n      includes cyclooxygenase (COX), prostaglandin receptor, P53 and excision-repair\n      polymorphisms.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Participants undergo ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation to the right buttock at baseline, receive\n      celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 10 days, and then undergo UV-irradiation to the\n      left buttock. Chromameter readings are obtained 24 hours post UV-irradiation."
