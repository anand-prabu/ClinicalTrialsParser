Genetically identical to the prospective organ recipient at the HLA loci\n\n          2. Exposure to any investigational agents at the time of kidney donation, or within 28\n             days prior to kidney donation\n\n          3. Any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder, or other condition that, in the\n             opinion of the Investigator, may invalidate communication with the Investigator\n             and/or designated study personnel\n\n          4.

Malignant or pre-malignant haematological conditions\n\n         11. Any uncontrolled medical condition or concurrent disease that could interfere with\n             the study objectives\n\n         12. Any condition which, in the judgement of the Investigator, would place the subject at\n             undue risk\n\n         13. Ongoing treatment with systemic immunosuppressive drugs at study entry\n\n         14. Participation in another clinical trial during the study or within 28 days prior to\n             planned study entry\n\n         15.
