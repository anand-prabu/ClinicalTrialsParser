Hormone therapy\n      using leuprolide and flutamide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of\n      androgens. Combining radiation therapy with hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of hormone therapy plus radiation therapy\n      in treating patients with prostate cancer."

Patients with unchanged or\n      undetectable prostate specific antigen levels are considered to have reached maximal\n      hormonal response and three dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy is instituted.\n      In addition, patients with disease progression are considered to have reached maximal\n      response, and three dimensional conformal external beam radiotherapy is instituted.\n      Radiotherapy must be administered within 6 months after initiation of leuprolide and\n      flutamide therapy.\n\n      Hormonal therapy is administered until 9 months of treatment have elapsed.\n\n      Patients will be followed every 3 months for the first year, every 4 months for the second\n      and third years, and every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 105 patients will be accrued from biologic class II over 3\n      years, and 58 patients from biologic class III-IV."
