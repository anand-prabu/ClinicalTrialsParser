Some\n      do not respond at all while others respond initially but gradually lose effect despite\n      increased dose and more frequent administration.\n\n      The cause of treatment failure is largely unknown and it may be production of tnf-alfa\n      neutralizing antibodies. This has been demonstrated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis\n      and inflammatory bowel disease who lost response after treatment with tnf-alfa blockers."
