Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such\n      as enzalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses\n      high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving enzalutamide, radiation therapy, and hormone\n      therapy may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer."
