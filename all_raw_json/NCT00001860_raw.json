The primary goal is to normalize insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)\n      levels.  Secondary goals are to compare Sandostatin LAR\u00ae (Registered Trademark) Depot\n      treatment and transsphenoidal surgery to achieve the following goals:  suppress growth\n      hormone levels to less than or equal to 2.5 ng/mL, relieve the clinical signs and symptoms\n      of acromegaly, reduce the size of the macroadenomas, produce few side effects, assess the\n      prognostic value of baseline pituitary adenoma size, extension and baseline growth hormone\n      level on post-treatment growth hormone and IGF-1 levels, and assess the resource utilization\n      of each treatment type."
