  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the extent to which intranasal oxytocin affects changes in
      social decision making and evaluations of others. Oxytocin is a hormone that naturally
      occurs in the body and the brain and has been shown to be relevant for many behaviors,
      particularly in social situations. Research on the effects of oxytocin in aging is very
      scarce; therefore, the purpose of this research project is to determine the effects of
      oxytocin on socioemotional aging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to demonstrate oxytocin as a causal mechanism in socioemotional aging, the
      investigators propose to temporarily elevate oxytocin levels and then measure activity in
      the brain while participants engage in socially relevant tasks. Participants in this study
      will be randomly assigned (much like flipping a coin) to receive either a single
      administration of oxytocin or a placebo (a substance that looks like the oxytocin but does
      not have any active drug). Neither participants nor the investigator will know to which
      condition each participant is assigned. Prior to being enrolled into the study a screening
      to determine eligibility will be conducted. Once the screening visit is completed and it has
      been determined that subjects can be randomized into the study,  an appointment will be
      scheduled for the full study visit.

      The purpose of the screening is to determine whether the individual is eligible for
      participation in the study and will consist of a series of questions about demographics and
      health history, two saliva samples, two short tasks, blood test, and brief meeting with a
      licensed clinician to ensure that it is safe for the individual to take part in the magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and drug administration.

      The study visit will comprise two collections of saliva for laboratory tests prior to and
      following the oxytocin administration in order to measure levels of the hormone in the body
      at baseline and after the spray. Saliva samples will also allow for an examination of how
      oxytocin-related genes may impact cognition and behavior during study tasks. Participants
      will work on various social tasks while in the MRI scanner, and response accuracy, response
      time, and brain activity will be recorded. After the scan, participants will complete a
      series of brief questionnaires on paper and on the computer.
