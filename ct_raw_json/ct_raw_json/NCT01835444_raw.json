In the\n      Netherlands reallocation of care to Physician Assistants (PAs) hasn't adequately been\n      studied. Given the growing number of PAs, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness and\n      efficacy of (Dutch) PA services.\n\n      This multicenter matched-controlled study aims to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of\n      substitution of hospital ward care from medical doctors (MDs) to PAs. The traditional model\n      in which the role of house officer is taken by medical doctors MD model) will be compared\n      with a mixed model in which a PA functions as house officer together with a medical doctor\n      (PA/MD model). Hospital wards will be matched on medical specialism and hospital type (i.e.\n      academic;non-academic). On the basis of USA studies, it is hypothesized that the mixed PA/MD\n      model compared to the MD model reduces the costs of healthcare, while improving or\n      maintaining the clinical outcomes, patients and provider satisfaction, and continuity and\n      quality of care.\n\n      Primary research question:\n\n      \u2022 What is the effect of 'mixed PA/MD model' compared with 'MD model' on efficiency of care?\n\n      Secondary research questions:\n\n        -  What is the effect of 'mixed PA/MD model' compared with 'MD model' on clinical and\n           patients outcomes?\n\n        -  What is the effect of 'mixed PA/MD model' compared with 'MD model' on continuity of\n           care?\n\n        -  What is the effect of 'mixed PA/MD model' compared with 'MD model' on nurses and\n           (specialist) medicals doctor experiences?\n\n        -  What are the barriers and facilitating factors considering the implementation of PAs as\n           house officer?"

We have selected both clinical indicators and process indicators, with a follow-up period of maximum 1 month after discharge. Clinical indicators were based on the national set of indicators for quality of hospital care from the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ) and consider the incidences of inhospital mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, unplanned readmission, presentation at emergency department after discharge,unplanned transfer to Intensive Care Unit, development of hospital infections, pressure sore and fever, and pain scores . Process indicators are the number of days between a patients discharge and the date of written turnover to general practitioner or other hospital, and acquaintance with the patient within 24 hours after admission",
