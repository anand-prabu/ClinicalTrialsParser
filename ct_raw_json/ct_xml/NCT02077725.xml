      Title: Measuring the impact of an interdisciplinary polypharmacy clinic within a
      patient-centered medical home

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this project will be to track the types of interventions made in an
      interdisciplinary polypharmacy clinic to improve medication regimens and medication burden.
      Polypharmacy has been well documented in the literature as a risk for medication errors,
      adverse drug events, and morbidity.  Team visits, including complete medication reviews, by
      pharmacists and physicians within a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) tier 3
      patient-centered medical home (PCMH) at an academic medical center, can improve medication
      regimens. Secondary objectives include (1) measuring each patient's quality of life at
      baseline and one month post-intervention and (2) tracking the cost of medication additions
      and discontinuations.

      Methods:

      Patients taking ten or more chronic medications will be identified for referral to the
      polypharmacy clinic from a report generated from the electronic medical record.  The
      polypharmacy clinic will be staffed by a pharmacist and medical resident with oversight from
      an attending physician who specializes in geriatrics. Drug-related problems identified
      during the visit will be resolved and categorized based upon indication, efficacy, cost,
      safety, and compliance.  The numbers and types of interventions made, both during the
      primary visit and anticipated in the future, will be tracked. The 12-item short form (SF-12)
      survey will also be administered at baseline and one month post intervention. The increase
      or decrease in cost for medications added and removed during these visits will be captured
      using the average wholesale prices.

      Preliminary Results Using descriptive statistics, the types of drug-related problems
      identified and interventions made will be reported. Changes in quality of life and monthly
      medication costs will also be described.
