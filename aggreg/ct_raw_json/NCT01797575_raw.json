Pregnancy\n\n        3. CANNOT change the dose of the psychotropic medications during the trial\n\n      Procedures to be used:\n\n      The study will be carried out at the outpatient clinics affiliated with the UT Health\n      Science Center at Houston. After signing informed consent, patients will be submitted\n      initially to a structure psychiatric diagnostic interview(SCID-I) to confirm the psychiatric\n      diagnosis, followed by a physical examination and routine labs (CBC, liver function tests,\n      electrolytes, kidney functions tests, thyroid function tests, urinalyses) to rule out\n      relevant medical problems. Physically healthy BD patients on psychotropic medications or\n      combinations will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive, orally, aspirin 1000 mg qam,\n      NAC 1000 mg bid, combination of aspirin 1000 mg qam and NAC 1000 mg bid, or placebo. The\n      study drugs doses will remain the same for the duration of the study.\n\n      Patients can be on any mood stabilizing agents or combinations, as well as on other\n      psychotropic medications at study entry, and the doses of those medications cannot be\n      changed during the trial. They cannot be on any anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant agents or\n      anticoagulant at the point they are enrolled. If patients decompensate significantly, and/or\n      become acutely suicidal, participation on the trial will be terminated.\n\n      If patients qualify for the study initially based on SCID-I interview, physical examination,\n      and routine labs (CBC, liver functions tests, electrolytes, kidney function tests, thyroid\n      function tests, and urinalyses), but are not currently taking an approved psychotropic\n      medication or combinations they are eligible to participate in a lead-in phase. This phase\n      would be starting at their screening visit and last approximately 6 to 8 weeks depending on\n      the patient's mood. During this lead-in phase, either the PI or Co-PI will evaluate the\n      patient and prescribe either Lithium or Depakote. The patient will be monitored during this\n      treatment phase by the PI or Co-PI and will return after two weeks for an evaluation. The\n      evaluation will include the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale(CSSR-S) to assess risk of\n      suicide, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale(MADRAS) to assess the severity of\n      depression and the UKU side effects rating scale. If the patient is prescribed lithium,\n      their lithium levels will be tested. The patient will continue to follow up every two weeks.\n      At the 4 week visit, the patient will also come in for evaluation (CSSR-S MADRAS and UKU\n      side effects rating scale).\n\n      At the 6 week visit, the patient will be re-evaluated for the double-blind study trial. If\n      the patient has been on an adequate dose of the psychotropic medication for at least 4 weeks\n      and score greater than 20 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), then\n      they will be enrolled.\n\n      If they do not meet inclusion criteria at the week 6 lead-in phase visit, they will return\n      at Week 8 and be re-evaluated. PI and Co-PI will continue to prescribe the psychotropic\n      medication throughout the lead-in phase (up to 8 weeks) and through the trial (up to 16\n      weeks).\n\n      During the lead-in phase participants will not be compensated. They will receive a voucher\n      for their parking for each visit. They will be responsible for filling and paying for all\n      prescriptions in both the lead-in phase and through the trial (up to 16 weeks).\n\n      Upon completion of the first 8-week double-blind trial, patients who responded to the active\n      medication will continued on the same study drug for an additional 8 week double-blind\n      treatment. The non-responders to one of the study drugs will be re-randomized for one of the\n      other three groups of study not received and will remain in treatment for an additional 8\n      week double-blind treatment. Treatment response will be defined as improvement in the MADRS\n      scores of at least 50%.\n\n      During the first 8-week trial, patients will be seen at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 for\n      clinical assessment and mood ratings. During the continuation trial, they will be seen at\n      weeks 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16.\n\n      Routine labs (CBC, liver function tests, electrolytes, kidney functions tests, thyroid\n      function tests, urinalyses) will be repeated at week 8 and week 16.\n\n      The main outcome measure for the study will be the scores on the Montgomery-Asberg\n      Depression Rating Scale, MADRAS, which assess the severity of depressive symptoms. All\n      patients will also be assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale, YMRS,which assess the\n      severity of manic symptoms. the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar version,severity of\n      illness, CGI-S,which is used to measure the severity of depressive, mania and severity\n      overall. And,  the UKU side-effects scale, which will assess all the side effects related or\n      not to the study group treatments.  In all visits, patients will be seen by the study\n      psychiatrist and the research staff will complete mood ratings with the MADRAS, YMRS,\n      CGI-BD, and the UKU side-effects scale.\n\n      At baseline (before randomization), week 8 and week 16 blood will be sampled for\n      proinflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6 and\n      tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha), and oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase\n      activity and catalase activity, serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), which\n      have been reported to be elevated in BD patients. These blood samples will be stored for\n      possible future research on biomarkers or future genetic studies for up to 20 years, for use\n      in pharmacogenetic research during this 20 year timeframe. The samples will be stored at the\n      Wet Lab, in a double locked -80 degrees freezer, at BBSB, Department of Psychiatry at\n      University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. (1941 East Road, suite# 3170\n      Houston-TX 77054) for future use studying factors of Bipolar Disorder. When (or before) the\n      20 year period ends, the blood sample will be destroyed.\n\n      At the screening visit, week 8, and week 16 we will also be testing the Lithium levels in\n      all patients that have been prescribed and currently taking the medication for study\n      purposes. This extra test will be conducted for the safety of the patient and more Lithium\n      level tests can be ordered under the PI's discretion throughout the 16 week trial.\n\n      Risks and potential benefits:\n\n      Aspirin is a safe medication for administration to humans and is approved by the FDA as an\n      anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent.  The dose proposed for this study is within the\n      safety range as per medication package.  Its side-effect profile is overall very favorable\n      and it has met widespread use worldwide over the past decades.  The main safety issues\n      relate to the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, which are rare (and will be\n      closely monitored in the weekly or biweekly visits that the study requires), and the\n      propensity to interfere with coagulation and cause consequent bleeding (which will be\n      prevented by excluding any individuals on use of anticoagulants or with active bleeding\n      problems).  There were a few case reports and small case series with other non-steroidal\n      anti-inflammatory agents suggesting worsening of depressive symptoms related to treatment\n      (e.g., indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen), but those were uncontrolled reports with\n      individuals who suffered from other medical illnesses (rheumatologic diseases).\n\n      For our proposed trial, because some patients may be on lithium at the time they start on\n      aspirin, we will exclude individuals with pre-existing cardiac and kidney disease.  For\n      patients on lithium, we will carefully monitor their serum lithium levels every two weeks\n      during the course of the trial.  Therefore, at the doses that are being proposed we do not\n      anticipate any significant problems related to safety of the proposed intervention.\n\n      NAC is a safe compound that is commonly available and utilized over-the-counter.  In a\n      recent study the tolerability was excellent and main side effects included changes in energy\n      level, headaches, heartburn and joint pain\n\n      Blood Draws: When the blood is drawn, there may be some minimal discomfort and/or bruising.\n      Infection, excess bleeding, clotting, or fainting is also possible, although unlikely. All\n      usual precautions will be taken to prevent these possibilities and these risks will be\n      minimized by using trained staff to perform the blood draws\n\n      Women Able to Become Pregnant: Participation in this study may involve risks to an embryo,\n      fetus, or unborn child. If the subject is a female and able to become pregnant, a urine\n      pregnancy test will be performed which must be negative prior to enrolling into the study,\n      and the subject must agree not to become pregnant during the study. Urine pregnancy tests\n      will be performed at Screening visit and week 8. The study staff will review adequate birth\n      control methods with the subject and will remind her that she should not become pregnant\n      during the study. Appropriate methods of birth control include: hormonal contraceptives\n      (such as birth control pills, patches, and implants), barrier methods (such as a condom and\n      diaphragms and spermicidal foam or jelly, surgical (hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or\n      intrauterine device (IUD). The subject will be instructed to notify the study doctor\n      immediately if there is a chance that she has become pregnant.\n\n      Also, if the subject is breast-feeding an infant or plan on breast-feeding an infant, she\n      must notify the study doctor. It is not known if this drug is excreted in human milk;\n      therefore, breast-feeding is not permitted during the study\n\n      Subjects will be carefully monitored. If a subject's condition worsen to the point that\n      he/she might become suicidal or severely depressed, we will terminate the subject's\n      participation in the study and referred to his/her psychiatrist for psychiatric treatment.\n\n      Breach of Confidentiality: Every effort will be made to protect the subject identity and\n      information during the study. All lab work and scan reports will be de-identified and the\n      medical records will be protected. However, there is a small chance that the subject\n      information may be viewed by someone that is not involved in the research study.\n\n      The study drug must be taken only by the person for whom it has been prescribed, and it must\n      be kept out of the reach of children or persons of limited capacity to read or understand.\n\n      By sharing your sample with the study doctor, there is a risk of the possible loss of the\n      subject privacy. Although no identifiable (name, address, etc.) information will be shared\n      with others outside of this research project. The clinical information obtained from\n      subjects will be part of their medical records and maintained at UT Center of Excellence on\n      Mood Disorders, in the Department of Psychiatry at UTHSC-H, in facilities with adequate\n      safeguards for the protection of confidentiality. The research data will be collected and\n      recorded using only arbitrary code numbers for identification, in order to safeguard the\n      confidentiality. All data will be kept in a secure area. Only the members of the UT Center\n      of Excellence on Mood Disorders research group, who will get approval from CPHS, will have\n      access to the data files, or to the master list for the codes. For publications purposes,\n      the patients will be designated only by their assigned codes.\n\n      These blood samples, for use in pharmacogenetic research during this 15 year timeframe,\n      samples will be stored at the Wet Lab, in a double locked -80 degrees freezer, at BBSB,\n      Department of Psychiatry at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. (1941 East\n      Road, suite# 3170 Houston-TX 77054) The possibility exists that the subject information may\n      be taken and used for reasons outside of this project. The United States' Genetic\n      Information Nondiscrimination, Act (GINA) of 2008, does not allow for employers or health\n      insurance companies to discriminate against the research subject based on his/her genetic\n      information. This means that health insurance companies or employers are NOT ALLOWED BY LAW\n      to ask or use any of the subject genetic information (DNA, RNA, etc.) gained through testing\n      to make decisions that affect the subject or hisher family's health coverage or income in a\n      negative way\n\n      Importance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result:\n\n      The study will examine possible novel mechanism of actions with modulation of inflammatory\n      mechanisms and oxidative stress and could result in the development of novel, low cost, safe\n      and widely available treatments for BD patients who have not responded to other commonly\n      utilized alternatives"
