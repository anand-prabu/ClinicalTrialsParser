The study doctors hope to use the analysis of these\n      fats to learn more about nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NFLD). Nonalcoholic fatty liver\n      disease is the accumulation of fat in the liver of people who have minimal alcohol exposure.\n      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, and\n      predicts development of Type 2 Diabetes. The study doctors are interested in looking at the\n      relationship between liver fat and insulin resistance."

Patients enrolled in the bariatric surgery clinic who are planning to undergo and\n             have insurance approval for bariatric surgery;\n\n          3. Insulin sensitive (based on HOMA-IR calculated from screening labs) OR insulin\n             resistant (based on HOMA-IR and or personal history of diet controlled diabetes)\n\n          4. Able and willing to give informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        The following will exclude subjects from study participation:\n\n          1. Clinically significant medical issues outside of diabetes (eg, pregnancy,\n             cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled pulmonary disease). If female and of child\n             bearing potential, a pregnancy test will be performed and confirmed negative prior to\n             participation in the study and prior to the scheduled glucose clamp procedure.\n\n          2. A history of hematologic (platelets <100 x107/L), hepatic (liver function tests\n             [LFTs] >2X upper limit of normal), renal (Creatinine >1.5 mg/dL), pulmonary/ cardiac\n             abnormalities (ie, abnormal electrocardiogram [EKG]).\n\n          3. Use of anti-diabetes medication, anticoagulants, or medication that might alter\n             lipids. If the subject has a history of diabetes, it should be controlled by diet\n             alone.\n\n          4. Inflammatory or celiac intestinal disease;\n\n          5. Untreated thyroid disease;\n\n          6. Excessive alcohol use, illicit drug use, or active untreated psychiatric disease."
