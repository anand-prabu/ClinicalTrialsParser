  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to improve the process for contacting patients that test
      positive for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the emergency department by using
      text messaging.  We believe patients that are contacted by both a phone call and a text
      message will be reached more often  and they will be reached sooner than those that only
      receive a phone call or only a text message.  In addition, patients will be given reminder
      cards at the time of testing to remind them that they will be contacted within 7 days if
      they test positive.  Half of the reminder cards will have a number to call for test results.
       We believe patients that receive a card with a number are more likely to be contacted
      within 7 days.
