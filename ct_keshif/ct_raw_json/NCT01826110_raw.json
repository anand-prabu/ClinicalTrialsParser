To perform PET scans with [11C]PIB to use for direct (i.e., same-subjects) comparison\n           of [11C]PIB and [18F]AV-45\n\n        2. To establish the most effective and reliable PET imaging method to detect amyloid\n           deposition in AD, in order to understand disease progression and subsequently evaluate\n           treatment effects.\n\n        3. To ascertain a PET imaging method that will minimize discomfort for subjects, thus\n           increasing the potential for clinical follow-up scans, by reducing the patient burden\n           and potential cost of future PET examinations.\n\n      A separate protocol/study will be conducted using [18F] AV-45. Participants who enroll in\n      this protocol using [11C] PIB will be consented to participate in the [18F] AV-45 (IRB #\n      NA_00033155) protocol/study as it is a mandatory requirement that participants participate\n      in both protocols.Up to 20 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and 10\n      healthy volunteers will participate in this study."
