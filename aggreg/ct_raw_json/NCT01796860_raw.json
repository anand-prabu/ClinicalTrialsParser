This orthotic is fabricated to allow ankle range of motion\n      required for normal gait kinematics.  Additionally, it controls forward progression of the\n      tibia during the stance phase of gait.  This study has three hypotheses 1. Individuals who\n      are fit with the AFO will demonstrate improvements in spatial and temporal gait parameters\n      2. Individuals who are fit with the AFO will demonstrate improvements in walking endurance,\n      and 3. Individuals who are fit with the AFO will demonstrate improvements in muscle firing\n      profiles/EMG measures."

Lower extremity strength, 5. MS Fatigue scale, 6. Observational Gait Analysis\n      - Video tape of over ground walking.  This study will be 13 weeks long.  Over the 13 week\n      period, the subject will participate in 5 gait training sessions which will be at weeks 1,\n      2, 3, 7, and 10.  They will be 60 minutes in duration.  Outcome measures will be assessed at\n      the following times: initial (T1), week 5 (T2), and week 13 (T3).  Subjects will be closely\n      monitored throughout the 13 week study and will be un-enrolled by self-request or the\n      following medical reasons: 1. Acute exacerbation of MS symptoms, 2. New diagnosis with\n      direct consequences affecting gait training, 3. Inability to tolerate the study AFO."
