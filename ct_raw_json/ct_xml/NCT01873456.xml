  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that there is a profit potential by implementing a multifactorial
      nutritional intervention among frail elderly since this will result in an improved
      nutritional status, functional capacity and improved quality of life.

    <description>Here is used information on additional costs of nutrition efforts, which on the one hand involves all costs associated with the effort, while on the other hand also be seen on the savings that can be attached to the outcome of the effort. Since the purpose is to illustrate the cost-effectiveness, the net profit on the cost side is also compared with the effect of nutritional intervention in terms of improved quality of life, and hence would be able to shed light on efforts from both resource use and a health effect</description>
