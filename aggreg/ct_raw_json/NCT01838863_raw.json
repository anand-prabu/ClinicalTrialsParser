Up to one-third of\n      severely injured trauma patients are found to be coagulopathic and forty percent of the\n      mortality following severe injury is due to uncontrollable hemorrhage in the setting of\n      coagulopathy. It has been established that early administration of fresh frozen plasma\n      decreases mortality following severe injury, replacing lost coagulation factors, improving\n      the coagulopathy and restoring blood volume. This study will determine if giving plasma to\n      severely injured trauma patients during ambulance transport versus after arrival to the\n      hospital will help reduce hemorrhage, thus decreasing both total blood product\n      administration and mortality."
