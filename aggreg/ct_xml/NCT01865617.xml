      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of laboratory treated T cells
      to see how well they work in treating patients with relapsed or refractory chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. T cells that
      are treated in the laboratory before being given back to the patient may make the body build
      an immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of adoptive T cell therapy using ex vivo expanded
      autologous cluster of differentiation (CD) 8+ and CD4+ CD19 chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR)-T cells for patients with advanced CD19+ B cell malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and
      the phenotype of persisting T cells.

      II. To determine if adoptively transferred T cells traffic to the bone marrow and function
      in vivo.

      III. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells results in depletion of CD19+
      B cells in vivo as a surrogate for functional activity.

      IV. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells has antitumor activity in
      patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.

      V. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells is associated with tumor lysis
      syndrome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19 CAR T-cells.

      Patients receive anti-CD19-CAR lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cells intravenously
      (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Treatment may be repeated in 30 days if there is
      persistent disease in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 15 years.
