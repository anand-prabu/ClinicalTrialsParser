  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fat grafting represents a technique with great potential to improve outcomes in minimally
      invasive facial reconstruction. Fat grafting has already been demonstrated as a safe and
      minimally invasive technique over decades of widespread practice in plastic surgery. In our
      current study of fat grafting for facial deformities (IRB# PRO09060101), we have treated 9
      subjects without adverse event and all have had a significant improvement. Since all methods
      of treatment and evaluation are the same in this study, we will be able to use the data in
      our prior study as additional control data.

      We hypothesize that repeating the fat grafting in subjects with previous facial fat grafts
      will enable successful restoration of tissue volume and craniofacial form. Additionally, we
      hypothesize that the results will be durable and subject quality of life improved.

      Five (5) subjects (who were previously enrolled into IRB# PRO09060101) will be enrolled to
      this single center University of Pittsburgh site research study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facial trauma injuries, especially those sustained in military combat and severe automobile
      crashes, are characterized by destruction of bone and soft tissue anatomy. While the bony
      skeleton can often be reconstructed, the overlying soft tissue is difficult to restore.

      Importantly, it is the structure of the soft tissue that imparts the normal human form, and
      adequate reconstruction of soft tissue defects allows trauma victims to reintegrate into
      society. Accepted procedures for soft tissue reconstruction of the face involve tissue flap
      reconstruction procedures and autologous fat grafting. Tissue flap operations are extensive,
      often including microvascular surgery, and do not precisely correct the deformities. Fat
      grafting is a less invasive technique that allows for more precise shaping of the
      reconstructed tissues. However, autologous fat grafts may undergo resorption that can affect
      the appearance of the reconstruction over time. The degree of change in appearance after fat
      grafting has not been well studied for facial trauma patients.

      We hypothesize that subjects who have successfully completed participation in the study
      (PRO09060101) and experienced graft resorbtion will have improved outcomes with an
      additional fat graft treatment. We anticipate that additional fat graft treatment will fully
      restore the facial features and overcome fat loss from the initial fat graft treatment.
      Additionally, we hypothesize that the cellular properties of the fat precursor cells
      (preadipocytes) may correlate with fat graft retention

    <description>Fat grafting is a minimally invasive clinical procedure that has been widely used by plastic surgeons within reconstructive surgery for many years. Fat grafting is considered a standard of care procedure in plastic surgery. In brief, fat tissue to be used for grafting is harvested (usually from abdomen or thighs) with a small liposuction cannula in the operating room. The fat tissue is then sterilely centrifuged and allowed to decant before separating the fluid and oil layers from the fat tissue fraction. The aspirated fat is then loaded into 1cc syringes and injected into the facial deformity using specialized injection cannulas. In this study, we will treat 5 subjects from protocol (IRB # PRO09060101) with an additional fat graft treatment to assess whether this will increase fat graft retention over time. Additionally, data from our current study assessing volume retention after fat grafting for facial deformities (IRB # PRO09060101) with be used for comparison.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18 years or older and able to provide informed consent

          2. Have suffered injury resulting in craniofacial volume defects which could be treated
             with a graft volume of between 5 and 150 cc of lipoaspirate

          3. Be at least 3 months post-injury or post-surgery (from trauma procedures) so that
             acute edema is resolved

          4. Volume defects are covered by intact skin and do not communicate with oral cavity or
             sinuses

          5. The three dimensional geometry of the volume defects would allow for treatment with
             lipoaspirate injection that in a manner that at least two distinct treated areas
             could be discerned on gross examination and radiographically (e.g. treated regions
             are on opposite sides of the face, on lower face versus upper face, or separated by a
             bony landmark such as zygoma. This would include the ability to treat an uninjured
             contralateral region with lipaspirate in order to obtain symmetry.

          6. Willing and able to comply with follow up examinations, including radiographic
             studies

          7. Have completed participation in IRB# PRO09060101.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 18 years

          2. Inability to provide informed consent

          3. Craniofacial defects intended for treatment have open wounds or communicate with oral
             cavity or sinus (note: presence of such a defect in the setting of another defect(s)
             that meets treatment criteria will not exclude the patient from participating).

          4. Active infection anywhere in the body

          5. Diagnosed with cancer within the last 12 months and /or presently receiving
             chemotherapy or radiation treatment

          6. Known coagulopathy

          7. Systemic disease that would render the fat harvest and injection procedure, along
             with associated anesthesia, unsafe to the patient.

          8. Pregnancy

          9. Subjects with  Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder. (Subjects who are found to be stable
             on medication and receive psychiatric clearance could be eligible for study
             participation per the Physician's discretion.)
