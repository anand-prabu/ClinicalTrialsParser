Our primary goal\n      was to investigate the effects of magnesium sulfate and dexmedetomidine used for controlled\n      hypotension on visibility of surgical site.\n\n      Methods: Sixty patients aged between 18-65 years were enrolled. Patients were divided into\n      two groups. In the magnesium sulfate group (Group M) patients were administered 40 kg-1\n      magnesium sulfate in 100 ml saline solution in 10 minutes as IV loading dose 10 minutes\n      before the induction and 10-15 mgkg-1hour-1 infusion during the surgery.  In the\n      dexmedetomidine group (Group D) patients were administered 1 \u00b5gkg-1 dexmedetomidine in 100\n      ml saline solution as loading dose 10 minutes before the surgery and 0.5-1 \u00b5gkg-1hour-1\n      dexmedetomidine during the surgery.  Deliberate hypotension was defined as a mean arterial\n      pressure (MAP) being 60-70 mmHg."
