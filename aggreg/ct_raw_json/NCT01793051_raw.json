It looks like the study drug but it is not designed to treat any\n      disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study\n      drug has any real effect.\n\n      Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the\n      placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what\n      you are receiving.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      You will take the study drug/placebo by mouth, two times a day for about 3 months, starting\n      the first day (or within 2 days) that you begin your lenalidomide therapy.\n\n      You should take the study drug/placebo with a full glass (8 ounces) of water.  You may take\n      it with or without food, but if the study drug/placebo causes an upset stomach, you should\n      take it with food.\n\n      You check with the study doctor about continuing any drugs you are currently taking. The\n      study drug may not mix well with other drugs.  You should not take bismuth (Pepto-Bismol),\n      calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, multivitamins with minerals, colestipol, cholestyramine,\n      didanosine, and/or antacids within 2 hours of taking the study drug.  You should also avoid\n      alcohol (including wine, beer, and liquor), driving, and doing other tasks or activities\n      until you learn how the study drug affects you.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      You must bring the study drug/placebo container, along with any remaining drug, with you to\n      your clinic visit at each new cycle of lenalidomide therapy, or at the clinic visit when the\n      study is over if no clinic visits are scheduled until then.\n\n      Before you start lenalidomide therapy:\n\n        -  You will fill out 4 questionnaires about pain and other symptoms.  It should take about\n           20-25 minutes to complete all of the questionnaires.\n\n        -  A study staff member will also be asked questions about your demographic information,\n           such as your marital status, job status, education, and race will also be collected.\n\n      During lenalidomide therapy:\n\n      -You will complete a symptom questionnaire in the clinic or by telephone 1 time each week\n      about any symptoms you may be having and how they may be affecting your daily activities.\n      The symptom questionnaire should take about 3-5 minutes to complete each time.\n\n      During your clinic visit at each new cycle of lenalidomide therapy, you will fill out 3\n      questionnaires about your pain and other symptoms. It should take about 15-20 minutes to\n      complete all of the questionnaires each time. If no clinic visit is scheduled until the\n      study is over, these questionnaires will be collected over the phone by the study\n      coordinator.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      You will have an end-of-treatment visit at the end of month 3.  At this visit, you will\n      complete 4 questionnaires about pain and other symptoms.  It should take about 20-25 minutes\n      to complete all of the questionnaires.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug/placebo for up to 3 months.  You will no longer be\n      able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if\n      you are unable to follow study directions, or the study doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Minocycline is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of bacterial infection.  The use of minocycline to reduce chemotherapy\n      related side effects in patients with MM is currently being used for research purposes only.\n\n      Up to 88 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson Cancer\n      Center."
