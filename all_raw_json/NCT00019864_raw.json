Giving chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that\n      it can be removed during surgery. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving chemotherapy before and after\n      surgery works in treating patients with osteosarcoma."

Patients also receive methotrexate IV over 4 hours followed by\n           leucovorin calcium in weeks 3 and 4. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF)\n           subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and\n           continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for 2 courses in\n           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Surgical resection: Patients undergo definitive surgery in week 11.\n\n        -  Adjuvant therapy: Patients receive dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate,\n           and leucovorin calcium as in neoadjuvant therapy*. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for\n           up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      NOTE: *Cisplatin is not administered in courses 3 and 4 of adjuvant therapy\n\n      Patients are followed within 4 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2\n      years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study."
