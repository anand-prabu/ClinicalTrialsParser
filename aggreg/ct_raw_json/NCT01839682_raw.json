Information collected\n      will include the patient's ability to ambulate independently and activity level pre and\n      post-treatment, decrease or increase in pain level compared to pre-treatment, and monitoring\n      adverse events.   Data will be collected at enrollment, procedure, discharge (or 1 day post\n      procedure), 1 week, 1 month and 3 months post procedure using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)\n      for pain score, Oswestry Disability Index.   Standard of care radiographs and MRI or CT/bone\n      scan are evaluated by a board certified radiologist. The data collected will be compared to\n      measure outcomes."
