However,\n      the rotational protocol is obvious different between DARCA and single-axis RA. A recent\n      study has assessed the diagnostic accuracy of DARCA, but this study was not designed for\n      image content analysis and the number of patients included did not provide sufficient\n      statistical power to allow a valid comparison of DARCA with SA.
