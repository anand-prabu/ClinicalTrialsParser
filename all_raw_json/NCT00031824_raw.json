It is not yet known if standard therapy for\n      graft-versus-host disease is more effective with or without hydroxychloroquine.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of standard therapy alone\n      with that of standard therapy plus hydroxychloroquine in treating patients who have newly\n      diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease."

Patients\n      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      Patients may receive standard therapy comprising prednisone orally or IV 2-3 times daily or\n      every other day and cyclosporine orally or IV twice daily or tacrolimus orally twice daily\n      or IV by continuous infusion before randomization. Patients not receiving cyclosporine or\n      tacrolimus prior to randomization may receive cyclosporine or tacrolimus after randomization\n      according to institutional preference.\n\n        -  Arm I: Within 10-14 days of beginning therapy with prednisone and cyclosporine or\n           tacrolimus, patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard therapy with prednisone and cyclosporine or\n           tacrolimus as in arm I and oral placebo twice daily.\n\n      In both arms, treatment continues for 9 months in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no response after 2 months of therapy are taken off\n      study.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 month, 9 months, and 1 year.\n\n      Patients are followed every month for 3 months and at 9 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 232 patients (116 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 3.6 years."
