This protocol outlines the procedures to be utilized in order to\n      prospectively follow the diagnosis and treatment of infectious complications in transplant\n      patients."

A letter to transplant physicians will introduce this\n      study. Data collection will begin immediately upon consent and continue for up to five\n      years. The informed consent form specifically requests permission to contact the subject in\n      the future to verify information or if the subject is lost to follow up by Transplant\n      services.\n\n      The Day of transplant will be considered day 0 for enrollment in this observational study.\n      Data will be collected on clinical template forms completed by study team members, as\n      infectious complications become apparent in either outpatient ID clinics or on the inpatient\n      service. A member of the research team will complete data collection in the registry,\n      maintained on the REDCap platform. In addition, patient electronic records will be reviewed\n      every 3 months to identify and record infectious complications, treatments administered, and\n      outcomes. During these intervals, subjects will be contacted by phone to review the same\n      outcomes.\n\n      Creation of the registry relies on use of standardized definitions to define infections. An\n      electronic database has been constructed in the REDCap system, documenting subject\n      demographics, transplant variables, infection variables, treatments administered, and\n      overall outcomes, during each interim time period."
