Eligible patients (n=250) will be enrolled in the Clinic for Thoracic Diseases,\n      Heidelberg, over a time period of two years and followed up for a total of 12 months.\n\n      Patients will be randomized either to EIP plus Care Management Phone Calls (CMPC) versus\n      CMPC alone (besides a proper symptom and side effect management CMPC ensures the potential\n      influence of social contacts that can be anticipated for the patients in the intervention\n      group).\n\n      Our primary aims are to investigate whether a combination of a partly supervised (in- and\n      outpatient) and partly home-based endurance and resistance training improves quality of life\n      (QoL) and lowers levels of fatigue (evaluation via the standardized and validated\n      questionnaires FACT-L and MFI). In addition we propose to evaluate the effects of EIP on\n      tumor specific immune responses. Biomarkers of immune function will be measured by cellular\n      immunity and cytokine and chemokine panels.\n\n      Further secondary outcomes include measurement of anxiety, depression and demoralization,\n      physical performance parameters (e.g. improvement in walk distance, muscle strength), as\n      well as overall and progression free survival analyses.\n\n      The study builds on a previous feasibility study of a 8 weeks exercise intervention trial in\n      patients with advanced NSCLC with the results being utilized in the design of the here\n      proposed trial.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized in the exercise intervention group\n      will show improved QoL and reduced fatigue, as well as improved physical functioning and\n      increased tumor specific immune responses."
