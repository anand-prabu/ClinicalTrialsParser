            "textblock": "Hip replacement is a common surgical procedure performed to relieve the pain and disability.\n       In general, the surgery consists of replacing the diseased or damaged joint surfaces of the\n      hip with metal and plastic components shaped to allow continued motion of the hip. Surgeons\n      may perform this operation in several different ways. The purpose of this study is to\n      compare two different methods of performing total hip replacement. The investigators\n      hypothesize that subjects treated with the anterior approached may show improved function\n      during the early postoperative period, but that no differences in pain or function will be\n      present after the first postoperative year.\n\n      In this study, patients that have elected to have hip replacement and consented to\n      participate in the study will be randomized to have his or her hip replaced using one of two\n      surgical techniques. Subjects will be randomized to be implanted using either an anterior or\n      posterior approach.  With the anterior approach, the study surgeon will use an incision that\n      is on the front of the hip, and with the posterior approach, the incision will be more on\n      the backside of your hip. The study surgeon has done more than 300 total hip replacements\n      with both of these techniques.\n\n      A baseline assessment will be conducted before hip replacement surgery that includes x-rays,\n      functional tasks like getting up from a chair and stepping down a step, and three\n      questionnaires about the hip, the subject's general health, and how well the subject is able\n      to function.  Also, subjects will be required to return to the clinic at several time points\n      after surgery for follow-up visits.  Follow-up visits will include hip assessments and\n      questionnaires, as well as follow-up hip x-rays. The follow-up visits will be 6 weeks, 3\n      months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 10 years after hip replacement surgery. These\n      follow-up visits are part of the study surgeon's normal routine for hip replacement\n      patients, and are not extra visits as a part of this study."
