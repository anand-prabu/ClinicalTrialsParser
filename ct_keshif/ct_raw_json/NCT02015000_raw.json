There is a lack of consensus in the\n      ophthalmological community about the optimal surgical management of pterygia. The main\n      challenge to successful surgical treatment of pterygium is recurrence, evidenced by\n      fibrovascular growth across the limbus onto the cornea.\n\n      Previous studies using a large incision for pterygium excision and a large graft and has\n      reported a very low recurrence rate with the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. technique. However, the\n      P.E.R.F.E.C.T. for PTERYGIUM technique is not that perfect since it is a lengthy procedure,\n      requires meticulous handling of tissue, and is associated with significant postoperative\n      pain and, frequently, transient diplopia. Therefore, we try to evaluate the final outcome of\n      a sutureless amniotic membrane transplant technique combining the extended pterygium\n      excision in hope to avoid the complication of the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. for PTERYGIUM technique.\n      This sutureless technique with the tissue glue may promote increased clinical use of\n      amniotic membrane patch by alleviating patients' pain and shortening surgical time."
