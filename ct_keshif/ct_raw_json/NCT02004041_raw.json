The screening phase comprises a screening visit when subjects'\n      preliminary eligibility for the study will be evaluated and a wash-out period when subjects\n      will stop use of any current topical or systemic treatment. The evaluation period comprises\n      4 weeks of randomized double-blind treatment. The post-therapy follow-up period consists of\n      a wash-out followed by a clinic visit for safety assessments and to check for residual\n      efficacy of the treatment."
