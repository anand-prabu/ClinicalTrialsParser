This study will\n      include 3 menstrual cycles, beginning with one menstrual control cycle, following by one\n      menstrual cycle with meloxicam ring administration and finishing with another control\n      menstrual cycle.\n\n      Meloxicam will be administered via a vaginal ring in two doses of 2.4 g and 3.0 g/ ring\n      during one menstrual cycle.  Safety study of absorption will be assessed.  Also the\n      investigators will study the effect on follicular development and if it maintains ovarian\n      cyclicity, as well as shown in recent study with oral administration."
