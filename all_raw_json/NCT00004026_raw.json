Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive CT-2584 IV over 6 hours daily for 3 days every 3\n      weeks. Arm II: Patients receive CT-2584 IV over 6 hours once every 7 days for 3 weeks.\n      Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80 patients will be accrued for this study."
