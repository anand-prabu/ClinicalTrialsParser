      The goal of this study is to determine  the performance  of  a  salivary  hormone
      competitive   immunoassay for   monitoring  patient  estrogen  and progesterone levels
      during treatment for infertility  using controlled  ovarian stimulation (COH)  and in vitro
      fertilization  (IVF). Specifically, inter-  and intra-assay precision, correlation with
      serum measurements (the gold-standard), and user satisfaction will be determined.
      Ultimately, the potential applicability and reliability of salivary steroid monitoring in
      IVF cycles will be assessed.

    <description>The potential applicability and reliability of salivary steroid monitoring during infertility treatment will be measured as a progression during a patient's IVF stimulation cycle. Concurrent saliva and blood draw measurements of Estradiol and Progesterone will be taken between 3-5 times during a 2-week monitoring period. Equivalence will be determined by the matched progression of Estradiol and progesterone levels (pg/ml) in the same patient at the concurrent times. Saliva Estradiol and Progesterone levels are of a magnitude of 100-200 less than serum based values and are converted using an algorithm to adjust to serum equivalence. Matched T-test will be used to test the hypothesis that the two methods are not statistically different.</description>
