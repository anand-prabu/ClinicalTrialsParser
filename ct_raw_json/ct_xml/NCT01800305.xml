    <textblock>
      The object of this randomized, parallel, positive controlled study is to explore the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile of the test drug after single-dose
      subcutaneous administration, compared to the comparator drug (EPIAO®) after multiple-dose
      subcutaneous administration, by assessing plasma concentration of the drug and the
      reticulocyte count, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit following subcutaneous
      administration, evaluate the security and tolerability of the test drug in healthy subjects,
      and provide sufficient information for dose selection in the future phase II and III study.
