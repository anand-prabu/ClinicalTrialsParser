As this intervention can be offered in\n      groups, costs are relatively low. In addition, delivering MBCT online might make the\n      intervention more accessible and cost-effectiveness. However, more information is needed\n      about what treatment works best for which patient.\n\n      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate clinical and cost-effectiveness of both\n      individual MBCT online and MBCT offered as a group training compared to TAU .\n\n      Study design: The design of the study will be a multi-centre, randomised, superiority trial,\n      comparing MBCT online and MBCT offered as a group training with TAU. Participants in the TAU\n      condition will be randomised to one of the treatment conditions after 3 months. Main\n      assessments will take place at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and 3 (T2) and 9 months\n      after post-treatment (T3).\n\n      We expect the MBCT conditions to be superior to TAU in terms of improving mindfulness\n      skills, anxiety and depressive compants, psychological well-being, rumination and fear of\n      cancer recurrence. We also expect the MBCT to result in patients returning to work earlier,\n      have a higher work ability and have lower medical care costs."
