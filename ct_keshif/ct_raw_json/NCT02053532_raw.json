In this pilot study we propose to use the combined\n      positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) scanner and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose\n      (FDG, an analog of glucose, the most commonly used PET ligand) to examine brain function and\n      directly correlate the data with the intrinsic functional connectivity of brain circuits\n      that are responsible for social, emotional and cognitive processing in both individuals with\n      PTSD and group-matched trauma controls (TC) and healthy controls (HC).  Once the machine is\n      validated, we will then use a more specific biomarker to better understand the neurochemical\n      factors that contribute to individual differences in PTSD. Thus, the data obtained from this\n      pilot study will guide our future molecular imaging studies. The link between general brain\n      function, specific molecular target and the intrinsic functional connectivity of brain\n      circuits that are responsible for social, emotional and cognitive processing in PTSD, TC and\n      HC will be explored."
