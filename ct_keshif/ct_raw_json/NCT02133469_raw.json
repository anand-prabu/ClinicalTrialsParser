In the phase 3\n      study involving Chinese infants, Prevenar was shown to be immunogenic, well tolerated, and\n      safe when given either separately or concomitantly with a diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular\n      pertussis (DTaP) vaccine at 3, 4, and 5 months of age. Controlled clinical trials elsewhere\n      in the world showed the correlation between immunogenicity and disease prevention.  In\n      addition to the direct effect of Prevenar, immunization of children has also reduced the\n      incidence of disease in adults. The changes are presumed to be due to reductions in\n      nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotype S. pneumoniae in children who have been\n      vaccinated.\n\n      The purpose of this study will be to assess the effectiveness of Prevenar vaccination to\n      reduce vaccine serotype (VT) NPC rates in Chinese children aged 2 to 5 years old."
