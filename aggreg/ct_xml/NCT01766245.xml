  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the bioequivalence
      (assessment of the expected biological equivalence of two pharmaceutical drug products with
      identical active ingredient) between subcutaneous injections of semaglutide produced by two
      manufacturing processes.
