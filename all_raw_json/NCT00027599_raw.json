Biological therapies such as APC8015 use different ways to stimulate the\n      immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab\n      can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal\n      antibody therapy with biological therapy may kill more cancer cells."
