            "textblock": "The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose that can be given\n      safely to patients, the potential side effects of the drug and how they can be managed. The\n      study will also look at what happens to Anti-CD19 (DI-B4) inside the body.\n\n      DI-B4 is a type of drug called an Anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody which is being used to stop\n      the growth and kill cancerous immune cells by targeting the B-cell marker (CD-19) expressed\n      on their surface. This drug has not been given to patients before.\n\n      DI-B4 will be given weekly by intravenous infusion for four weeks. The study is in two\n      parts. In Part 1, small groups of patients will be treated at increasing doses to find the\n      highest safest dose and best dose for part 2 of the study. Approximately 16-20 patients will\n      be treated in this part. In Part 2, the dose identified in Part 1 will be given to\n      approximately 20 patients.\n\n      Patients recruited to the study will receive four weeks (cycles) of treatment. They will\n      attend an end of therapy visit eight weeks after their last dose of DI-B4, and attend\n      follow-up visits up to eighteen months after their first dose of DI-B4. Information on the\n      overall and progression free survival will be collected for a period up to eighteen months\n      after the final patient is treated on the study.\n\n      Patients will have blood and urine samples taken each week during treatment amongst other\n      clinical tests. CT scans will be performed at the start of the study, at eight weeks post\n      treatment and six months after the study start. Bone marrow biopsies and FDG-PET scans will\n      only be taken if needed. Research blood samples will also be taken to look at what happens\n      to the drug inside the body.\n\n      It is important to explain that patients will have advanced cancer so it is unlikely that\n      patients will benefit directly from taking part but the study may help improve future\n      treatment of cancer."

The target antigen, CD19, is the canonical B-cell marker that\n      is expressed on all B-cells including the malignant B-cells in NHL, CLL and acute\n      lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).  The CD19 antigen is therefore an attractive B-cell lineage\n      specific target for monoclonal antibody therapy. DI-B4 is expected to act through the\n      depletion of normal and malignant CD19 positive cells, primarily via ADCC.\n\n      This is a multi-centre, Phase I, dose escalation/dose expansion study.  For the first three\n      cohorts, an intra-patient dose escalation scheme will be followed unless a DLT is observed.\n      From Cohort 4 onwards,  a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schedule of DI-B4 will be continued\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined, up to a maximum dose of 1000mg."
