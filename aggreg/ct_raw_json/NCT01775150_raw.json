Counties in Huaihua area of Chinese province of\n           Hunan will be randomly allocated to intervention and non-intervention groups.\n\n        2. The intervention:\n\n           Mobile phone text messages containing maternal and newborn health care education\n           material will be sent to mothers-to-be at the first, second and third trimester, and\n           again postpartum period.\n\n        3. Statistical analysis:\n\n      We will first compare the baseline characteristics (including the average income, adult\n      educational level, and maternal and perinatal mortality rates in the past two years) between\n      the 2 arms of experiment. For costs data, total costs, costs per participating woman, and\n      costs per maternal/infant death avoided will be reported. For primary outcomes, we will\n      determine and report rate ratios, risk differences, and numbers needed to treat (NNT) from\n      the experimental arm (i.e., mobile phone text messaging), using the usual care arm (no text\n      messaging) as the reference. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be expressed\n      as the effect measures. We will estimate the adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence\n      intervals by regression analysis. Mixed models taking consideration of multi-level measures\n      (e.g., mortality and morbidity measured at individual level and intervention measured at\n      village level) will be used in the regression analysis (Donner and Klar, 2000)."
