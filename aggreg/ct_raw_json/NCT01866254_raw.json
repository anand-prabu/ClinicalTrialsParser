Intrathecal Intrathecal hydromorphone has been shown to be effective at\n      treating post cesarean section pain and possibly with less side effects than morphine.\n\n      One side effect of morphine is respiratory depression occurring hours after the start of\n      morphine use. Respiratory depression occurs when air being taken into the lungs is less than\n      normal, leading to a lower amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide being exchanged in the blood\n      stream. Because hydromorphone dosages are lower and it has a quicker onset of action than\n      morphine, it is believed that the use of hydromorphone should decrease the possibility of\n      delayed respiratory depression."
