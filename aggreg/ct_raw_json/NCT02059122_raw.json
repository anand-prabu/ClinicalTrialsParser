This test is intended to be used on sera obtained within the first 7 days of\n      symptoms. DENV Detect\u2122 NS1 ELISA results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by testing\n      with a reference standard test.\n\n      Subjects will be patients who present with symptoms consistent with dengue infection, such\n      as fever and myalgia. After informed consent is obtained and the subject is screened for\n      eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will be collected. The first will be collected within the\n      first 7 days of symptoms onset, and the second will be collected at least 7 days later,\n      between the 10th and 21st days post-onset of symptoms.\n\n      ELISA and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory staff\n      members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples\n      from each method independently."
