Determine the maximum tolerated dose of carmustine when administered\n      following O6-benzylguanine in patients with recurrent, persistent, or progressive cerebral\n      anaplastic gliomas. II. Characterize the toxic effects associated with this treatment\n      regimen in these patients. III. Observe patients for clinical antitumor response when\n      treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior nitrosourea administration (yes or no).\n      (Prior nitrosoureas stratum closed) An initial cohort of 3 patients per stratum is treated\n      with intravenous O6-benzylguanine followed approximately 1 hour later by intravenous\n      carmustine every 6 weeks. Additional cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with escalating\n      doses of carmustine until dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. The maximum tolerated\n      dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT. Courses\n      are repeated every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-56 patients (12-28 per stratum) will be accrued in 12\n      months."
