Irresolvable joint pain or loss-of-function with an undeterminable cause\n\n          8. Diagnosis of a concomitant meniscal injury in involved knee that requires surgical\n             intervention\n\n          9. Loss of joint space on standing radiographs (\u2265 1 on Ahlb\u00e4ck-scale (0-5))\n\n         10. Avascular necrosis\n\n         11. Infections, systemic or local\n\n         12.
