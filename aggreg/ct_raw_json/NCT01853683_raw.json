In these cases, the\n      patient is often treated non-surgically with antibiotics.  Once a patient has improved, it\n      is not known whether it is better to perform an interval appendectomy (IA) or to continue a\n      watchful waiting approach.  The purpose of this trial is to determine if expectant\n      nonoperative management (watchful waiting) is not inferior compared to IA management after\n      successful conservative treatment of appendiceal mass at admission."
