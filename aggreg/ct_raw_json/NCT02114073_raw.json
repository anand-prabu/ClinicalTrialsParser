            "textblock": "Trabeculectomy is still the most popular filtering surgery for glaucomatous patients. In\n      this type of surgery, postoperative care and management is highly important for surgical\n      success. A principle component of postoperative regimen is anti-inflammatory medications.\n      However, corticosteroid eye drops, the most frequently used agents, have some side effects,\n      including raising intraocular pressure.\n\n      Cyclosporine A could be an interesting alternative, because not only it has acceptable\n      anti-inflammatory effect and could reduce some ocular surface problems, but also it has\n      minimal direct effect on intraocular pressure. In this study, we will compare the effect of\n      topical cyclosporine A and betamethasone on surgical outcome and postoperative course of\n      trabeculectomy patients.\n\n      The study is a prospective study to compare the effect of topical betamethasone and\n      cyclosporine A on postoperative findings of glaucoma patients, undergoing trabeculectomy\n      surgery.\n\n      In this study, trabeculectomy patients, who fulfill the study criteria, will be randomized\n      to either study group and follow-up visits will be done in a masked fashion. In each visit,\n      a detailed history taking and eye examination will be done by an examiner unaware of study\n      group. A third party would do data control for patient safety. At the conclusion of the\n      study, the data of the two groups would be compared. All human research ethical codes are\n      strictly respected and the Ethical Committee of the University has an ongoing inspection on\n      all study steps.\n\n      We hypothesize that cyclosporine A could provide better inflammation and intraocular\n      pressure control and may enhance surgical success rate. However, our null hypothesis is that\n      the result in study groups will not differ statistically significantly."
