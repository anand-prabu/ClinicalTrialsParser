  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the study are to investigate the needs of caregivers in caring for older adults
      (65+) with cancer at 1-week of hospital discharge and to explore strategies that may assist
      caregivers in their home caregiving needs. The study will enroll older cancer patients and
      their caregivers admitted to 9100 and 9300, which are hematological and non-hematological
      malignancy units at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) respectively. Findings derived
      from this study will inform the development of interventions for better discharge
      preparation of caregivers for home caregiving. Additionally, the study has the potential to
      reduce non- emergent use of acute healthcare services through caregiver support and
      education.

      Baseline demographic data about the caregiver and patient will be collected at patient
      beside prior to hospital discharge. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with the cancer
      caregivers in their home at 1-week after their loved one was discharged from the hospital,
      and at 2-weeks after discharge from the hospital. This is a qualitative study that will
      utilize a qualitative descriptive method.

    <description>At 2 weeks a second qualitative interview will be conducted with the cancer caregivers. The purpose of this interview is to clarify any statements made in the first interview, and identify any additional challenges faced in caregiving, or any aspects of caregiving that have become easier for the caregiver. This will be measured by the coding in the interviews.</description>
