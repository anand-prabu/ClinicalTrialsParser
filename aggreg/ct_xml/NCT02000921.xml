      The main focus of this study is to determine the use of nicotine-containing products across
      the three experimental conditions. Subjects will be monitored to determine their continued
      use of assigned cigarettes, switching to other combusted and/or non-combusted tobacco, or
      cessation of all tobacco containing products.
