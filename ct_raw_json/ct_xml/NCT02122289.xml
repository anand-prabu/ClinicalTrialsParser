    <textblock>
      Exacerbation in cystic fibrosis play an important role in terms of mortality and morbidity.
      Exacerbation frequencies is relatedto FEV1 decline and mortality. There is a relationship
      between exacerbation frequency and QoLdeterioration. Moreover exacerbation treatments
      present health costs burden leading to important physical psychological and social impact.
      Preventing exacerbation and early detection of these exacerbations may decrease intensity
      and freqauency of exacerbation leading to increase clinical status and QoLwith a decreased
      health cost.

      Patients actually follow in CRCM track exacerbations when visits out patient clinic and
      during phone call. If patients did not call or did not  present regularly to out patient
      clinic, exacerbation detection came later and so increasde the burden and therapeutic
      pressure.

      The objective of our study is to identify earlier the potential exacerbations and so
      decreased the health costs and increased the patient's QoL. Forthis purpose we propose to
      use modern technologiessuch as smartphone in order to create alert when patients report
      weekly health satatus. We will compra patients randomize in control group with standart
      follow-up to patients randomize in the smartphone group.Moreover we will study the
      compliance and satisfactory degree of the use of this device in the interventional arm.
