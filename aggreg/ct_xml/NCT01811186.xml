      Objectives:

        1. Objective of main interest

           - To assess the drop-out rate caused by adverse event* after 6 weeks treatment

        2. Further objectives

             -  To assess the drop-out rate caused by adverse event* after 1 week treatment

             -  To assess the pain reduction rate after 6 weeks treatment from baseline

             -  To assess the EQ-5D

             -  To assess physician's overall satisfaction

             -  To assess subject's overall satisfaction

             -  To assess safety

      Study Design (Methodology):

      This will be a single center, open-label, randomised, phase IV, exploratory interventional
      study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of current titration patterns and slow
      titration pattern with TARGIN® (Oxycodone/Naloxone) in the treatment of moderate to severe
      non-malignant chronic pain patients who are dissatisfied with their current analgesic
      medication (WHO step II analgesics).

      Upon providing written informed consent, subject will be screened in the study and
      assessment will be performed at that time such as safety laboratory assessments, physical
      examination, vital sign, medical history taking, 24 hours pain intensity score. If the
      patient is eligible in inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of visit 1, the patient will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to allocate in Group A or Group B. Re-screening, study drug
      dose interruption is not allowed.
