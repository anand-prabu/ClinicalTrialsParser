It is a rare cancer which occurs in individuals who have been exposed\n      to asbestos, although it typically occurs decades after exposure (10-40 years later).\n      Malignant pleural mesothelioma forms plaques that are distributed on the surface of the\n      pleural space in the lung.   Approximately 30% of patients require an indwelling pleural\n      catheter for drainage of pleural effusions. In this patient group, the indwelling catheter\n      may be used to facilitate loco-regional delivery of HSV1716 to the pleural space.\n\n      This study seeks to evaluate the safety and biological effects of single and multiple\n      administrations of HSV1716 in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma."

Delivery will be by direct administration\n      via an indwelling catheter into the pleural cavity. PART B is a single centre, repeat dose\n      design, open label.
