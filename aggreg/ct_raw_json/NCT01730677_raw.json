Treatment repeats\n      every 21 days unless there is any evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity\n      or noncompliance by patient with protocol requirements. Response will be documented by\n      physical examination, chest or abdomen CT prior to treatment as a baseline, and every 2\n      cycles (window period \u00b1 1 week) after a start of treatment and at 18 weeks."
