There is now established evidence indicating TMS is an effective treatment for\n      depression. However, the effectiveness of TMS varies between people, thus requiring further\n      research to investigate its optimal application. Investigators want to compare the\n      effectiveness of different forms of TMS, given with differing stimulation settings to the\n      right or left side of the brain that has been associated with depression. This could\n      potentially help clinicians in the future to improve the prescription of TMS as a treatment\n      for depression."
