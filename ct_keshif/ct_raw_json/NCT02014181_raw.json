Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease resulting from a\n      mutation in sodium and chloride transport channels that results in pancreatic insufficiency,\n      chronic sinusitis and chronic lung infections. The investigators hypothesize that chronic\n      inflammation and oxidative stress are a part of the chronic exacerbations that are a part of\n      cystic fibrosis.  The investigators believe that flaxseed with its anti-inflammatory and\n      antioxidative properties can help dampen these stressors on the CF lung and potentially\n      result in fewer exacerbations of CF, fewer antibiotics, fewer hospitalizations, and improved\n      well-being."
