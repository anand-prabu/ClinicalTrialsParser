            "textblock": "Breast cancer is a Lebanese national problem.  Campaigns for mammography screening are\n      effective but recommendations on breast examinations screening for breast tumors are\n      lacking. On one hand, the Lebanese population is a culturally diverse one with women's\n      beliefs ranging from liberal to extremely conservative. On the other hand,\n      physicians-in-training learn Clinical Breast Examinations (CBEs) in a non-standardized\n      method and randomly when real patients are available and are willing to be examined by\n      students. There is no research on breast cancer screening through physical examination\n      (self-examination or by a trained health care worker) in Lebanon. In addition, little is\n      known about how religious beliefs and other cultural factors could affect rates and efficacy\n      of breast examination in detection of cancerous lesions.\n\n      In this project, we focus on the need for an effective and culturally sensitive method for\n      teaching CBE to physicians-in-training. The proposed teaching methods is this study is\n      standardized with double simulation meaning that it is a teaching method that is repeated in\n      a similar manner with all students where they learn physical examination of the breast using\n      both artificial breast models (simulators) and trained fake patients/actors (standardized\n      patients). We hypothesize the efficacy of such standardized teaching method in making\n      medical students more aware of, and apt to deal with, cultural differences related to breast\n      examination. In order to do so, we will evaluate medical students' performance and examine\n      their attitudes and cultural competencies when they perform CBEs on 3 culturally different\n      standardized patients using breast simulators. Through an experimental design that minimizes\n      biases related to selection of students (randomized controlled), we will compare double\n      simulation (intervention) with single simulation (control) in teaching CBE i.e. a\n      standardized patient wearing breast simulation jacket versus a single breast silicone model\n      without any actors. Medicine-III students rotating in the Obstetrics and Gynecology\n      department will be asked to participate; they are free to refuse without any effect on their\n      grades in the rotation. The students will be assessed in an Objective Structured Clinical\n      Examination (OSCE) setting similar to their usual oral clinical exams but not contributory\n      to their academic evaluation in the Faculty of Medicine. The OSCE setting will include\n      encounters with 3 culturally different Standardized Patients (1 \"outgoing\" patient, 1 with\n      \"chador\", and 1 moderately conservative). The assessment tools include both objective and\n      self-reporting questionnaires about (1) met learning objectives, (2) student attitude, (3)\n      and clinical cultural competency."
