            "textblock": "The current preferred minimally invasive treatment for surgically related or in-situ benign\n      biliary stenosis (BBS) involves open surgical revision, endoscopic retrograde\n      cholangiographic (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic (PTC) balloon\n      angioplasty and/or stent/biliary catheter placement. Unfortunately, most patients are poor\n      open surgical operative candidates. Although ERCP is the preferred secondary approach,\n      anatomical restrictions often require PTC. Additionally, previously placed biliary\n      stents/catheters have poor long term patency and require routine exchange every 3-6 months.\n      The vast majority of surgically related BBS patients are non-operative candidates for\n      surgical revision of their BBS, and do not have favorable anatomy for ERCP access. For\n      patients who have failed aggressive PTC balloon angioplasty of their stenoses, treatment\n      consists of indefinite biliary catheter exchanges every 3 months. Lifelong biliary catheter\n      dependence severely impacts the quality of life in an otherwise healthy patient with no\n      additional evidence of their initial disease process.\n\n      A potential long-term therapy to alleviate BBS that has not been explored is the use of\n      laser excision of the fibrotic tissue responsible for these stenoses. Therapeutic\n      applications of lasers in medicine is not a novel concept. Its use has been well documented\n      in the urologic tract to ablate tissue (benign prostatic hypertrophy) and renal stones.\n      Recent laser therapeutic use in the biliary tract to dissolve gallstones has been described.\n      The laser excision of BBS has potential to provide long term alleviation of BBS. The primary\n      endpoint of this feasibility study is to assess the safety and initial efficacy of BBS laser\n      excision."
