  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of stress reduction on physiological and
      psychological variables in adults with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who have moderate to severe
      levels of diabetes-related emotional distress.  Subjects will be randomized to one of two
      interventions.  We will evaluate the impact of the interventions on glucose metabolism,
      blood pressure, diabetes-related distress and quality of life. Additionally, we will
      investigate the role of neuroendocrine dysfunction, systemic inflammation and diabetes
      self-care practices as mediators in the relationship between increased stress, adverse
      glucose metabolism and elevated blood pressure in those subjects with T2DM.
