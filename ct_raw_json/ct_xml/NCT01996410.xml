  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if acupuncture improves multiple symptoms associated
      with chemotherapy on the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI):  nausea, vomiting, fatigue,
      anxiety, anorexia, pain, disturbed sleep, shortness of breath, dry mouth, depression, and
      peripheral neuropathy (see statistical section). The investigators hypothesis is that
      acupuncture will result in lower MDASI scores over the course of chemotherapy for the
      acupuncture group vs. control group.

    <description>The investigators will first plot M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory Core Items (MDASI) scores over time for the acupuncture and control groups to visually inspect for differences between the two groups.  The investigators will further evaluate the difference in MDASI scores for the two groups using linear mixed models that account for multiple measurements within a single patient.  A mixed model is preferable to a repeated measures ANOVA in this case, as it allows for missing time points within a single subject without eliminating that subject from the analysis.
Additionally, the investigators are able to specify how our time points are correlated within patients rather than assuming equal correlation across time points.  The MDASI is comprised of 13 separate items that are not summative; therefore, the significance level for all statistical tests will be set at 0.003 (0.05/13) to account for multiple comparisons.</description>

    <description>Chemotherapy 1: This group will receive Adriamycin (60mg/m2) and Cytoxan (600mg/m2) concurrently on day 1 every 2 weeks for 4 cycles followed by Taxol (175mg/m2) on day 1 every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients on this regimen who randomize to the experimental (&quot;acupuncture&quot;) group will undergo acupuncture on the morning of every treatment for a total of 8 acupuncture sessions. Both groups will complete a MDASI on day 3 (+/- 1 days) of each cycle of chemotherapy for a total of 8 MDASI forms.</description>

    <description>Chemotherapy 2: This group will receive Adriamycin (60mg/m2) and Cytoxan (600mg/m2) on day 1 every 2 weeks for 4 cycles followed by Taxol (80mg/m2) on day 1 weekly for 12 cycles. Patients who randomize to the experimental (&quot;acupuncture&quot;) group will undergo acupuncture the morning of every treatment day of the adriamycin/cytoxan cycles; they will receive acupuncture for every third Taxol treatment, beginning with the first treatment. They will receive a total of 8 acupuncture sessions: 4 with the adriamycin/cytoxan cycles and 4 with the Taxol cycles. Both groups will fill out MDASI on day 3 (+/- 1 days) of each Adriamycin/Cytoxan cycle; they will also fill out the MDASI on day 3 (+/- 1 days) of every third Taxol treatment for a total of 8 MDASI forms.</description>
