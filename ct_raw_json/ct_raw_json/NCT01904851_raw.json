            "textblock": "XLPAD is an observational study designed to evaluate the effectiveness and use of stent and\n      non-stent based therapies among PAD patients. The study will create a registry that will\n      include entry of procedural and clinical follow-up information into an online data\n      collection software, REDCAP. The primary objectives of this observational registry study are\n      to:\n\n        1. Compare stent and non-stent based outcomes defined as a composite of symptom driven\n           target vessel revascularization (TVR), unplanned surgical revascularization of the\n           target limb and need for target limb amputation through 12 months post-index procedure\n           (Primary efficacy endpoint)\n\n        2. Compare stent and non-stent based outcomes defined as a composite of causes such as:\n           death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, peri-procedural complications, target vessel\n           revascularization (TVR) and unplanned surgical revascularization/amputation of the\n           target limb through 12 months (Primary safety endpoint)\n\n        3. Compare stent and non-stent based change in walking distance, Rutherford category\n           and/or ankle- brachial index (ABI) at 12 months compared to baseline (Primary clinical\n           improvement endpoint)\n\n      Approximately 2,174 patients will be enrolled at approximately 20 sites worldwide.\n      Enrollment in the observational study will be monitored in an effort to achieve at least 20%\n      (and no more than 80%) of the population receiving stents as the initial treatment strategy.\n      Follow-up visits by sites will be reported at 6 and 12 months after index procedure to\n      collect data on treatment patterns and effectiveness, and outcomes. The follow-up procedures\n      are not mandated by the registry protocol. Each site will be encouraged to enter follow-up\n      information derived from clinically indicated follow-up visits. All events post-index\n      procedure till the 7th month will be reported under the 6 month follow-up form and\n      subsequent follow-up till the 13th month post-procedure will be entered on the 12 month\n      follow-up form.\n\n      Patient management and treatment decisions are at the discretion of the care team per\n      routine clinical practice. The procedural aspects (including selection of stent type or\n      non-stent based treatments) and follow-up are not mandated by the registry and will be up to\n      the discretion of the operator and/or based upon the practice dictated by the clinical care\n      of the patient. Therefore the study poses minimal risk to the patient."
