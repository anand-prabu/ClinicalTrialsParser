These studies will\n      provide a means to identify an appetitive cue-sensitive pharmacologic-responsive\n      endophenotype. Once brain/behavioral/genetic endophenotypes can be determined prior to\n      treatment, smoking cessation treatments can be structured to meet individual needs, which\n      will significantly improve treatment outcome."
