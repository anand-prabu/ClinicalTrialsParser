            "textblock": "The main objective of this study is to determine whether the first (sentinel) lymph nodes in\n      the drainage pathway of colonic tumour can be detected at the time of surgery using a new\n      technique. The detection method is to inject a fluorescent dye (indocyanine green) adjacent\n      to the tumour. The dye will then be seen as it fluoresces in the light form the near\n      infrared spectrum that can be used at the time of the laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery. An\n      endoscope is placed in the colon (colonoscopy) during surgery and the tracer fluorescent\n      agent is injected around the tumour. The mesentery in which the lymph nodes draining the\n      tumour are located will then be examined by laparoscopy as it is expected that fluorescence\n      will be identified within approximately 5 minutes of the injection.  The first lymph node or\n      nodes that take up the fluorescent dye will then be marked by placing a clip or a stitch by\n      them. After the surgery has been completed and colon removed all lymph nodes can be examined\n      microscopically by the pathologist, paying a particular attention to whether any tumour\n      cells are present in the sentinel lymph nodes and whether the presence or the absence of\n      tumour cells in that node accurately reflects the tumour status of the rest of the specimen.\n\n      If this pilot demonstrates that sentinel lymph nodes can be reliably detected, we have\n      developed a technique which allows us to remove a small area (less than 5 cm) of the colon.\n      Using this procedure should decrease complications following traditional surgery. We however\n      also need a method that allows accurate assessment of the lymph nodes draining the tumour.\n      This pilot trial will examine our ability to detect such 'sentinel' lymph nodes so that we\n      can use their status (positive for cancer cells or negative) to determine whether a smaller\n      operation such as full thickness localised excision is adequate treatment for the patient\n      and that they can avoid a larger operation."

            "textblock": "1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n\n      1.1. Colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer is the third commonest cancer and second highest\n      cause of cancer death in the UK. Introduction of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program\n      and increasing awareness of symptoms of colorectal cancer will lead to an increase in\n      numbers of cancers detected at an early stage of the disease.  Standard surgical management,\n      however, remains unchanged and that is segmental colectomy with en bloc mesenteric resection\n      of the regional lymph nodes as the metastatic status of these nodes remains the most\n      important factor for determining adjuvant treatment.\n\n      This of course was appropriate when the majority of the patients diagnosed with colorectal\n      cancer presented with symptomatic, locally advanced disease. Our practice, however, needs to\n      be reconsidered in the view of the recently published data from screening centres. Pilot\n      results demonstrate a significant shift towards an earlier stage of the disease in the\n      screened population and suggests that, in future, up to 50% of screen detected-cancers will\n      be T1 or T2 (i.e. early stage disease) 1. Less than 15% of patients with T1 and T2 disease\n      have nodal involvement 2 but current radiological techniques are not sensitive enough to\n      identify these patients pre-operatively. Instead, major surgery is performed in all patients\n      with T1 and T2 stage colonic cancer, and in up to 85%, en bloc mesenteric resection provides\n      no therapeutic benefit, as they have node negative disease. Major resection also exposes\n      patients to a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, along with late side effects.\n\n      The concept of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) in colorectal cancer is not new and\n      although it has not had the same impact as in the clinical care of breast cancer, melanoma,\n      and more recently gastric cancer 3-6, some expert centres have suggested that it may be\n      clinically relevant 7, 8. The technique is based on the principle that the first possible\n      sites of metastasis along the lymphatic drainage route from the primary lesion are known as\n      sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and these can be detected using injection of dyes, radioisotopes\n      or a combination of both. Therefore, evaluation of the SLNs can result in an accurate\n      assessment of the nodal status in the entire lymphatic basin allowing a tailored surgical\n      treatment. Although this technique has transformed surgical care for melanoma and breast\n      cancer patients, its application in patients with colorectal cancer has been questioned due\n      to discrepancies in the reported results caused by the heterogeneous study designs employed,\n      variations in surgical experience and differing patient inclusion criteria 9-11.\n\n      Detailed analysis of studies performed to date shows that tumour and patient\n      characterisation as well as surgeons experience are key factors when assessing the utility\n      of the technique 2, 12 and at least three nodes need to be found in order to maximise this\n      13. The main research focus so far has been on optimising the technique itself. Initial\n      research was performed using blue dye, radioactive colloid or both in combination but this\n      failed to achieve the 95-97% identification rates found in breast cancer and was also\n      accompanied by unacceptable false negative rates 14-17. Although many authors noted that\n      their false negatives occurred predominantly in patients with advanced disease (T3 and T4\n      cancers) 18-20, utilisation of those identification agents has proven frustrating to date.\n      Radioactive colloids require involvement of a nuclear medicine physician, can be difficult\n      to localise with a handheld camera and cause signal interference if the SLN(s) is too close\n      to the injection site. Blue dyes however are difficult to localise in patients with a high\n      body mass index (BMI), who unfortunately comprise the majority of our patient population,\n      thus producing only limited (if any) visualisation of afferent lymphatic vessels and SLN(s).\n\n      In order to re-examine extensive research that has been reported on SLNM, a secondary\n      intention analysis of the two largest multicentre SLN databases was undertaken. This\n      reported that in 225 patients with T1 or T2 disease, accurate detection of SLNs was possible\n      in 95%, confirming that this staging technique should be most accurate in patients with\n      early colonic cancer 2. This improved with operator experience and when tumour size was\n      smaller than 35 mm in diameter. In 196 patients treated by experienced surgeons, 144\n      (73.4%), would have correctly undergone localised full thickness resection if surgery had\n      been based only on their SLNs status and 49 (25.0%), would have required conventional\n      resection either because the SLNs were not identified, or due to detection of metastases.\n      Only 3 patients (1.5%) would have been inappropriately predicted to be node negative.\n\n      1.2. Investigational Agent To overcome the aforementioned issues, a number of researchers\n      have utilized optical imaging using the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence lymphatic tracer\n      indocyanine green (ICG) which enables real-time intraoperative visualisation of lymphatic\n      channels and SLNs. The technique performs as well as the combination of a radioactive tracer\n      and blue dye in patients with breast cancer 21, and has also been validated in patients with\n      early gastric cancer 4-6.\n\n      ICG was initially recommended as a tattooing agent for colonic and pancreatic lesions to aid\n      perioperative localization 22-24, as there were no reports of complications such as focal\n      peritonitis, abscess formation, postoperative adhesions and ileus which had been seen with\n      the use of India ink 25-27. However, its use as a tattooing agent is limited to patients\n      undergoing surgery within 8 days after endoscopic injection, as the dye dissipates through\n      lymphatic channels due to its small molecular size 22. More recently, its fluorescence\n      properties have been utilised for intraoperative localisation of colorectal neoplasms and\n      associated SLNs 28-32 in patients undergoing surgery using either charge-coupled device\n      (CCD) or a NIR camera. Nagata et al. demonstrated that observation of ICG dye using a NIR\n      camera was far superior to that by conventional laparoscopy with identification of SLNs\n      being five times better 29.  These results suggest that a SLNM technique using NIR with a\n      fluorescent tracer may be useful in patients with a high BMI who have large amounts of\n      mesenteric adipose tissue. All authors reporting the NIR technique have noted its success in\n      colorectal practice, without adverse effects with a comparable role to its use in early\n      breast or gastric cancer.\n\n      1.3. Rationale The ability to utilise this technique and confidently identify the SLNs has\n      the potential to transform the surgical care of patients with colonic neoplasia. The focus,\n      however, must be on patients with early disease, thus allowing those who have node negative\n      disease to be considered for localised full thickness resection of their primary cancer as\n      definitive surgical therapy. Unfortunately, studies published to date have included patients\n      with T3 disease in their series 29, 31.\n\n      This pilot trial aims to apply a well-described technique using a NIR camera and ICG as the\n      tracer in order to clarify whether SLNs can be confidently identified in patients undergoing\n      conventional resection (segmental colectomy and en bloc mesenteric resection) for T1 and T2\n      colonic cancers. This protocol is based on extensive literature search of studies describing\n      the technique in patients with early gastric and colorectal cancers 5, 6, 29-31, 33-36.\n      Provided that the pilot trial is successful, and in order to obtain adequate power, a\n      further large multicentre trial will be required to determine whether the nodes visualised\n      by NIR mapping are representative of the patient's lymphatic basin metastatic status. Proven\n      concordance between the pathology of the SLNs and that of the standard nodal resection would\n      then justify a more limited surgical intervention, taking just the SLN(s), and allowing a\n      more precisely tailored operative intervention.\n\n      All patients in the pilot trial will undergo standard surgical treatment in addition to the\n      NIR SLNM technique.\n\n      1.3.1. Risk - benefit assessment\n\n      Potential benefits This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of NIR mapping with\n      ICG to identify SLNs in patients who are undergoing the current 'gold standard' treatment of\n      segmental colectomy and en bloc mesenteric resection; all patients are therefore still\n      receiving the current established standard of care for their condition. There will be no\n      direct benefit to the participants in terms of any reduction in the extent of surgery which\n      they receive, although this could potentially be a benefit of the imaging technique for\n      future patients in the long term. However, the study design does provide some benefit to\n      participants in that they will receive additional pathological scrutiny of their disease\n      above that which is usually performed. In addition to routine standard pathological analysis\n      of lymph nodes, the patients in this study will have ultra-analysis (including IHC) of the\n      nodes identified in the mapping. While the significance of micrometastases detected by IHC\n      is not entirely clear at present, this disease burden has been included in the TNM\n      classification as an indication for considering additive postoperative therapy. Also, the\n      addition of lymphatic mapping during the case can be expected to identify first order\n      draining lymph nodes lying outside the field of standard operative resection and this is\n      reported to occur in up to 14% of patients37. Excision and analysis of these nodes may\n      result in upstaging of disease extent and thus allow the recommendation of adjuvant therapy\n      leading to a potential improvement in prognosis.\n\n      Potential risks and their management\n\n      There are some small risks associated with the introduction of the additional imaging\n      procedure. There is a documented risk of allergic (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) reaction\n      of less than 1 in 10, 000 to the tracer agent - all participants will be asked about any\n      prior exposure to the agent or reaction to iodine dyes and shellfish. Case notes will also\n      be thoroughly reviewed by a member of the research team. However, if allergic reaction\n      occurs during or after administration of the ICG, standard hospital procedures will be\n      followed and further active study procedures abandoned. The patient will however be followed\n      up according to the protocol in order to collect the adverse event data until the adverse\n      event is resolved. A pregnancy test will be performed in all women of childbearing potential\n      and those who test positive will be excluded from the trial.\n\n      Colonic perforation related to the endoscopy procedure occurs in 1/2000 cases. This\n      procedure, however, is essential in order to inject the tracer agent. This risk will be\n      minimized by ensuring that this examination is performed by an experienced endoscopist and\n      it is significantly diminished with the use of bowel preparation that optimises the\n      endoscopic view.\n\n      Inclusion into the study will add 30 minutes to the total operative time which is thought to\n      be acceptable by the senior members of the investigative team with minimal risk to the\n      patient. Experienced clinicians will perform the surgical procedure and we expect that this\n      added time will decrease significantly as experience is gained with the technique in\n      question.\n\n      Overall benefit-risk assessment\n\n      In order to minimise the risks for potential participants, we will only use materials (ICG),\n      equipment (NIR laparoscopy camera, Olympus) and methods (endoscopic injection) for which the\n      risks are already known. Previously, the technique of sentinel node biopsy in colorectal\n      cancer was used to enable a more intensive examination of the lymph nodes after the\n      operation has taken place. Here, the proposal is that identification of the lymph nodes\n      before or during the operation could help the surgeon decide exactly which operation to do.\n      In this initial study we will use a single mapping agent and its fluorescence properties\n      will allow enhanced sensitivity of detection at the time of surgery. Standard surgery will\n      then be carried out. In choosing this agent, we have systematically studied the literature\n      and previous empiric experience with non-fluorescent, non-radioactive agents (primarily\n      methylene blue) and found this unsatisfactory in patients of average and above-average BMI.\n      If the results of this 'optimised' technical study are satisfactory, further work will be\n      proposed with a large multicentre study to assess sensitivity and specificity of the\n      technique.\n\n      ICG is routinely used in radiological and cardiac investigations and is well within safety\n      recommendations for both patients and the staff entrusted with their care. The Olympus\n      Infrared Laparoscopic System being used to detect the presence of the mapping agent in lymph\n      nodes has been CE marked (European Community directive conformity). Therefore, we consider\n      the overall risk to participants in  this study is minimal.\n\n      In addition, there are also potential benefits from participating in the trial. Rather than\n      undergoing standard pathological processing of their resected lymph nodes, patients in this\n      study will have added intensive study of their sentinel nodes (all other nodes will be\n      processed in the routine fashion). Aberrant nodes identified with the technique will also be\n      removed and analysed for evidence of metastases. This will allow highly sensitive detection\n      of tumour deposits (i.e. small micrometastases) that may be prognostically important in the\n      nodes most likely to harbour such deposits. Using this technique we also hope to identify a\n      proportion of patients with aberrant lymphatic drainage which will allow more accurate\n      staging of the disease and reduce the risk of understaging and therefore avoid depriving\n      patients of the benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy."
