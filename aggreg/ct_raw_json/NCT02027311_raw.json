Most ERCP procedure had been performed in\n      sedation using tranquilizers and pain-killers.\n\n      Until recently, midazolam and opioid combination regimen recognized as a standard therapy is\n      widely used, but the sedative effect is insufficient and intermittent paradoxical reaction\n      has been questioned. Another drug, such as propofol, has been known that the sedative effect\n      is superior one of the midazolam but disappointed due to narrow therapeutic range of\n      respiratory distress and absence of antagonist. Meanwhile, recently up-coming drug,\n      etomidate which is a modulator of GABA-A receptor has been known that it maintains the\n      appropriate sedative levels and affects little effects on respiratory system.\n\n      For these advantages, this short acting sedative drug has been widely used in the emergency\n      room during minor operation and in the operation room for induction. However, research on\n      the efficacy during ERCP was not yet published.\n\n      In this regards, the purpose of the investigators study is to prove the efficacy of\n      etomidate for sedation and to establish new evidence based sedation guidelines during ERCP\n      procedure."
