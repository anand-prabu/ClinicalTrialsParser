However, as few of these\n      adolescents seek medical care, little is known about the longitudinal course of adolescent\n      extreme obesity.\n\n      In this study, the investigators aim to provide structured care for adolescents with obesity\n      and extreme obesity over a prolonged period of time, and to gain information on the course\n      of obesity and the success of different treatment options. The study is a subproject of the\n      \"Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme obesity - acceptance and\n      effects of structured care\", short: \"Youth with Extreme obesity Study (YES)\", which aims at\n      improving the medical care and social support structures for youth with obesity and extreme\n      obesity in Germany. Obese youth and young adults (BMI \u2265 30kg/m2) between the ages of 14 and\n      21 years are eligible to participate. Participants will have a physical check-up every 6\n      months, complete questionnaires on their health, socioeconomic status and wellbeing, and are\n      offered blood test and diagnostic procedures to assess comorbidities. Participants are\n      offered support and guidance for social and vocational integration. The study will evaluate\n      and inform treatment and support options for adolescents with extreme obesity."

            "textblock": "Little is known about the longitudinal course of adolescent extreme obesity. In this\n      multicenter study, the investigators aim to enroll adolescents with extreme obesity (BMI \u2265\n      35kg/m2) in a 9 year longitudinal, prospective observation that will reveal information on\n      the course of obesity and the success of different treatment options. Adolescents with more\n      moderate degrees of obesity (BMI 30-34,9kg/m2) will serve as a control group. The project\n      builds on the Consortium \"Medical and psychosocial implications of adolescent extreme\n      obesity - acceptance and effects of structured care\", short: \"Youth with extreme obesity\n      Study (YES)\", which comprises the recruitment and characterization of obese youth from\n      different healthcare- and non healthcare settings, a randomized controlled trial to\n      investigate a novel intervention targeted at improving quality of life and social\n      functioning of extremely obese adolescents, a structured prospective evaluation of\n      adolescent bariatric surgery, and economic assessments of the financial burden of extreme\n      adolescent obesity on the healthcare system.\n\n      Based on the current state of knowledge, the investigators have formulated the following a\n      priori hypotheses in regards to the longitudinal observation study:\n\n        1. Youth with extreme obesity (BMI \u2265 35kg/m2) achieve lower adherence with the structured\n           care program compared to adolescents with more moderate degrees of obesity (BMI\n           30-34,9kg/m2).\n\n        2. Youth with extreme obesity (BMI \u2265 35kg/m2) are less likely to achieve and sustain\n           weight loss over a prolonged period of time, compared to adolescents with more moderate\n           degrees of obesity (BMI 30-34,9kg/m2).\n\n        3. Youth with extreme obesity (BMI \u2265 35kg/m2) are harder to integrate in the job market\n           compared to youth with more moderate degrees of obesity (BMI 30-34,9kg/m2).\n\n        4. Youth with extreme obesity (BMI \u2265 35kg/m2) have higher incidence and severity of\n           co-morbidities compared to youth with more moderate degrees of obesity (BMI\n           30-34,9kg/m2).\n\n      The investigators aim to recruit a total of 600 adolescents age 14 to 21 years with extreme\n      obesity (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2) and 600 adolescents with obesity (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) over a 24\n      months period. The five participating university centers are distributed across 4 geographic\n      regions in the North (Berlin), in the West (Essen/Datteln), in the East (Leipzig) and in the\n      South (Ulm) of Germany, and will therefore render data that are representative of Germany as\n      a whole. Adolescent will be examined biannually, and testing will include an array of\n      standardized questionnaires and validated instruments to assess health, psycho-social\n      situation, psychiatric co-morbidities and health related quality of life, as well as a\n      physical examination, laboratory tests, and screenings for orthopedic co-morbidities and\n      sleep apnea. Participants are offered support and guidance in regards to social and\n      vocational integration with the aim of improving self esteem and social functioning. Data\n      will be entered in an extended version of the \"German National Register for Longitudinal\n      Research on Childhood Obesity\". We will perform sub-analyses based on the treatment options\n      these youths have followed The project will reveal the acceptance and outcomes of a\n      structured healthcare program for adolescents with extreme obesity and provide unique\n      information on the medical and psychosocial development of adolescents with extreme obesity\n      in Germany."
