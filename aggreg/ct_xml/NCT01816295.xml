  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate if testosterone solution can raise
      testosterone hormone levels into the normal range, and also improve levels of sexual
      arousal, interest and drive and/or energy level, in men with low testosterone and decreased
      sexual arousal, interest and drive and/or decreased energy. The study will last about 16
      weeks,  followed by an optional 24 week open label treatment phase to investigate the long
      term safety of testosterone solution.
