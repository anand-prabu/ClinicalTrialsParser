      Study Part 1: This is a dose optimization phase designed to find a tolerated regimen that
      includes the maximum tolerated dose of INCB039110 (within a defined pharmacologic range) in
      combination with doses of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel that have established safety and
      tolerability in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Study Part 2: This phase will explore the safety and clinical activity of the regimen
      identified in Part 1, in subjects with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor (Part 1) or pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma (Part 2)

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1

          -  Received no more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease
             (not including neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy)

          -  There is no restriction on the number of prior non-myelosuppressive   targeted
             therapies or hormonal agents (eg, EGFR targeted therapy for lung cancer and hormonal
             therapy for breast cancer or ovarian cancer); targeted and/or hormonal therapy alone
             will not be considered chemotherapy for the purposes of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any known contraindications to the use of gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel.

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled brain metastases or history of uncontrolled seizures.

          -  Ongoing radiation therapy and/or radiation therapy administered within 28 days of
             enrollment or ongoing radiotherapy-related toxicities.

          -  Presence of ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy.

          -  Inability to swallow food or any condition of the upper GI tract that precludes
             administration of oral medications.

          -  Recent (≤ 3 months) history of partial or complete bowel obstruction.

          -  Unwillingness to be transfused with blood components.
