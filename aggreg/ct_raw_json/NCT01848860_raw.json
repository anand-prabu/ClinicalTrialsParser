            "textblock": "Primary spontaneous pneumothorax usually occurs in young, lean male without underlying lung\n      disease. In most cases, the cause of pneumothorax is rupture of blebs at the apex of the\n      lung. Traditionally, bullectomy with mechanical pleurodesis through thoracotomy is indicated\n      in patients with recurrence or persisted air leakage. In recent years, thoracoscopic\n      bullectomy with pleural abrasion is getting popular, thanks for the advance of endoscopic\n      instruments and technique. The pneumothorax recurrence rate after thoracoscopic surgery is\n      around 10%, which is significantly higher than that of thoracotomy. In addition, the rate of\n      postoperative prolonged air leakage is 5-8%. The possible causes of recurrent pneumothorax\n      and prolonged air leakage are missed bleb surrounding the endoscopic suture line or\n      suboptimal suturing or healing of the thoracoscopic suture. To prevent these complications,\n      a novel method using coverage of the endoscopic suture line by a large absorbable mesh\n      during thoracoscopic surgery was proved to be safe and feasible. Theoretically, the mesh can\n      strengthen the suture line and induce local fibrosis surrounding the suture line, and reduce\n      the rate of recurrent pneumothorax and prolonged air leakage. To prove this hypothesis, the\n      investigators are conducting a prospective randomized trial in National Taiwan University\n      Hospital. The investigators will enroll 204 patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax\n      who will be randomly assigned to additional mesh pleurodesis (mesh group, 102 patients) or\n      not (control group, 102 patients) after thoracoscopic bullectomy and pleural abrasion. The\n      primary endpoint is to compare the rate of pneumothorax recurrence within one year between\n      the two groups. The secondary endpoints are to compare the safety, efficacy, and long-term\n      pulmonary function between the two groups."

            "textblock": "Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly occurs in young, tall, lean males (1, 2). The\n      estimated recurrence rate is 23-50% after the first episode and increases to 60% after the\n      second pneumothorax (3). Optimal management of this benign disease, especially after repeat\n      attack, has been a matter of debate. Recent advances in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery\n      (VATS) that combine bullectomy with pleural abrasion provide a preferred intervention for\n      treating primary spontaneous pneumothorax (4-6). Unfortunately, recurrence rates of\n      pneumothorax after VATS range between 5% and 10%, which are higher than the rates reported\n      after open thoracotomy (7-11). It is suggested that a higher chance of missed leaking blebs\n      around the staple line of endoscopic staplers (12) and a less intense pleural inflammatory\n      reaction are induced by VATS procedure than by thoracotomy (13, 14). In addition,\n      postoperative air leakage usually occurs at the staple line. (7, 15) As a result, the\n      efficacy of VATS is questioned and more aggressive procedures, such as limited thoracotomy\n      with pleurectomy, are sometimes performed to enhance the effects of pleural symphysis (10,\n      14).\n\n      Theoretically, reinforcement of the visceral pleura around the staple line is a reasonable\n      way to prevent postoperative air leak and recurrent pneumothorax. Previous retrospective\n      studies showed that staple line coverage with absorbable mesh after thoracoscopic bullectomy\n      is safe and may be effective in decreasing the rates of pneumothorax recurrence (16,17). One\n      animal study also showed that when absorbable mesh insertion is coupled with pleural\n      abrasion, appropriate pleurodesis is predictably achieved (18).\n\n      In the present study, additional absorbable mesh coverage of the staple line will be\n      randomly administered in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax after VATS to test\n      the efficacy and safety of this method.\n\n      References\n\n        1.
