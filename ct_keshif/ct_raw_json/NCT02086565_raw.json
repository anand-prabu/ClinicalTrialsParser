            "textblock": "Background: Asthma morbidity is high in inner-city minority adults, despite the existence of\n      efficacious therapy. Tailored, patient-centered interventions are needed to improve access\n      to care and patient-provider communication. Access and communication increasingly rely on\n      information technology (IT) as new incentives arise to use the Electronic Health Record\n      (EHR). The EHR patient portal (PP) gives patients web-based communication with providers and\n      practices. How the poor and those with limited educational opportunities can take advantage\n      of these is unclear. In contrast, the investigators have found that home visits (HVs) by\n      community health workers (CHWs) can improve access to care for children and promote\n      caretaker-clinician communication. The investigators also found many inner-city adults have\n      internet access and are willing to learn to use the PP.\n\n      Objective: to examine the benefits for adults of using the PP with and without HVs by CHWs\n      who will encourage/facilitate PP use, understand patients' social context, and enhance\n      communication with the medical team. The investigatord hypothesize all patients will benefit\n      from PPs, and that the addition of HVs will be particularly helpful for those with low\n      literacy or language barriers. Specific Aims test if the 1-year interventions result in 1)\n      better within-group asthma outcomes, 2) better outcomes in one group over the other, 3) more\n      communication (use of PP) and access (appointments made and kept) which mediate the\n      interventions' effects on asthma outcomes, and 4) effect modification by literacy level,\n      primary language, and convenience of internet access.\n\n      Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 300 adults, predominantly African American and\n      Hispanic/Latino, with uncontrolled asthma recruited from low income urban neighborhoods will\n      be assured internet access and taught to use the PP, with and without HVs from a CHW. CHWs\n      will 1) train patients to competency in PP use, 2) enhance care coordination, 3) transmit a\n      view of the complex social circumstances of patients' lives to providers, and 4) make up for\n      differences in patients' health literacy skills.\n\n      Patient Outcomes are asthma control, asthma-related quality of life, emergency department\n      (ED) visits, and hospitalizations for asthma or any cause. Together asthma and other health\n      conditions affect patients' ability to perform their daily tasks and care for their\n      families. Potential benefits of the intervention are enhanced patient-clinician\n      communication, access to care, improved health, and ability to use IT."
