    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and patient reported quality of
      life of palliative first-line Perjeta (pertuzumab) in combination with Herceptin
      (trastuzumab) in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (metastatic or locally
      recurrent, inoperable) who relapsed after completed adjuvant Herceptin therapy.
      Additionally, information on selection criteria of breast cancer patients treated first-line
      with Perjeta, Herceptin and chemotherapy and their treatment duration will be collected and
      analyzed. Data will be collected from eligible patients for up to 20 months of treatment and
      24 months of follow-up.
