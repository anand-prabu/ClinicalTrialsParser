Methylphenidate is a central\n      nervous system stimulant that has traditionally been used in cancer patients to manage\n      depression, opioid\u2010induced sedation, hypoactive delirium due to multiorgan failure, and\n      cognitive disorder associated with brain tumors. Although there is evidence from prospective\n      studies of the efficacy of this drug in cancer\u2010related fatigue, the only one randomised\n      clinical trials gave non-conclusive results. In order to define the real efficacy of\n      methylphenidate in this setting, the investigators designed a new clinical trial comparing\n      methylphenidate and placebo in cancer\u2010related fatigue, assessed both by the verbal numeric\n      scale (VNS) included in the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and the subscale for\n      fatigue of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT\u2010F). The investigators will\n      include 122 advanced cancer patients with fatigue \u2265 5/10 (VNS, from 0 to 10) and hemoglobin\n      \u2265 9 g/dl. Patients will be randomized to methylphenidate or placebo. Doses will be adapted\n      to response within a range from 10 mg at morning time and 5 at noon, to 25 mg/day.\n      Assessment of response will be performed on day 3 and day 6 with ESAS and FACT\u2010F.\n      Drug\u2010induced adverse events will be checked. The VNS of fatigue on day 6 will be consider\n      the primary endpoint."
