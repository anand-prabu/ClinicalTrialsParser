            "textblock": "Urinary diaries have proven to be beneficial in assessing lower urinary tract symptoms\n      (LUTS), however they have not achieved widespread acceptance. The likely reason is the fact\n      that the pen and paper diaries are labor intensive for both patient (need to carry a pen and\n      paper and record each event) and doctor (need to transfer, summarize and analyze the data).\n\n      Hypothesis: Electronic voiding diary, would automate the recording and analysis of data,\n      expedite the process, improve its accuracy and cost effectiveness.\n\n      Electronic recording of lower urinary tract symptoms (SUF) uses wireless phone and web based\n      technologies to record LUTS remotely and store the data on a secure website which can be\n      accessed by the doctor or patient whenever needed. The goal of this study was to compare its\n      validity and reliability to the traditional micturition chart (MC) recording method - the\n      current gold standard where the patient records the time of micturition and degree of\n      urgency using a pen and paper."

            "textblock": "SUF records the sound of the urine stream striking the water in a toilet bowl. This\n      generates a sound file, which resembles the standard uroflowmetry recording. The degree of\n      urgency is recorded by pressing the number 1-5 on the key pad which corresponds to the\n      5-point urgency scale. Urgency is recorded immediately following micturition or whenever\n      experiencing urgency without bladder emptying. A dedicated server runs a program, which\n      automatically processes incoming data. All data recorded from an individual is stored\n      prospectively, in separate files, on a secure website. Each record is associated with a time\n      stamp, providing information on urinary frequency.\n\n      A pen and pencil MC will be used to record baseline parameters (voiding urgency and\n      frequency). Quality of life (QoL) will be evaluated using International Prostate Symptom\n      Score (IPSS) Questionnaire, and two standardized questions: Quality of Life due to Urinary\n      Symptoms (QoL US) and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC).\n\n      Time frame: Participants were followed for the duration of the study which consists of two\n      three day periods when every micturition event and lower urinary tract symptom not\n      associated with micturition was recorded. An expected average time will be 6 days.\n\n      Twenty nine men, average age 67.8 years (range 49 - 80), which presented to the urology\n      clinic with LUTS, were included in the study. After signing the informed consent, patients\n      will be asked to record every micturition and degree of urgency using SUF for a period of 3\n      days. They will then be asked to record their frequency of micturition and the degree of\n      every episode of urgency using a pen and paper MC for an equal length of time. The efficacy\n      of recording LUTS with each method will be analyzed and compared. The content validity of\n      SUF (assessment of whether the instrument makes sense to patients), will be assessed at the\n      conclusion of the study when all patients will be interviewed one-on-one by a specialized\n      research nurse. Patients will be asked to state their preference for one of the two diaries,\n      and disclose the number of events they forgot to or could not record. The construct validity\n      (relationship between the recorded data and underlying theories) will be evaluated by the\n      correlation of symptoms recorded with SUF or MC based on QoL measures. The results of this\n      study will be compared to previously published evidence, suggesting that more severe LUTS\n      are associated with a lower score on the health related QoL questionnaires."
