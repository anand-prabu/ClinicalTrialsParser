            "textblock": "This was a single center, single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-treatment, two-period\n      crossover bioequivalence study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence\n      of morphine sulfate formulations under fasted conditions. Normal healthy males and females\n      at least 18 years of age were screened for enrollment into the trial.\n\n      Potential subjects who met the eligibility criteria randomly received either oral Morphine\n      Sulfate 60 mg Extended-release tablets or oral MS Contin\u00ae 60 mg Controlled-release tablets\n      on Day 1 in Period 1, then, following the washout period, they were dosed on Day 8 in Period\n      2 with the other treatment. There was a 7-day washout period between dosing. The study drug\n      treatments were administered after almost a 12-hour fast. Fasting continued until slightly\n      over 4 hours post-dose for both treatment groups. All enrolled subjects were administered\n      single oral doses of 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride 10 hours predose, 1 hour predose, and\n      12 hours post-dose of the study drug treatment on Day -1 and Day 1 in Period 1 and on Day 7\n      and Day 8 in Period 2.\n\n      Potential subjects (ie, alternates) were administered single oral doses of 50 mg of\n      naltrexone hydrochloride 10 hours predose and 1 hour predose of the study drug treatment on\n      Day -1 and Day 1 in Period 1. Subjects visited the clinic at AAIPharma at Screening (within\n      28 days prior to dosing) to assess eligibility and returned to the clinic on Day -1 for the\n      Period 1 confinement period that lasted through Day 2. To complete Period 1, subjects were\n      to return on Day 3 for the collection of pharmacokinetic blood samples. Period 1 dosing was\n      followed by the 7-day washout period. Subjects returned to the clinic for the Period 2\n      confinement period on Day 7, which continued through Day 9. To complete Period 2, subjects\n      were to return on Day 10 in that period for the collection of pharmacokinetic and safety\n      blood samples.\n\n      Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments were performed during the conduct of the trial. Blood\n      samples for the evaluation of morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide plasma concentrations were\n      obtained while subjects were at the clinic and after discharge, as appropriate.\n      Pharmacokinetic samples were collected over a 48-hour period of time following\n      administration of the study drug treatment.\n\n      Medical care of the subjects was assured by the presence of a physician for at least 4 hours\n      post-dose, and the physician remained on-call to treat adverse events (AEs). Professional\n      medical personnel were on-site during the entire study confinement period. Adverse event\n      information elicited during Confinement at the clinic or during telephone contacts was\n      reviewed and documented."

Healthy subjects at least 18 years of age.\n\n          2. Willingness to provide written informed consent after being informed of the nature of\n             the study.\n\n          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 and a weight of at least 110 pounds.\n\n          4. Good health as determined by a lack of clinically significant abnormalities in health\n             assessments performed at Screening, as judged by the physician.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Any of the following was regarding as a criterion for excluding subjects from the trial:\n\n          1. Hypersensitivity to morphine sulfate (MS Contin\u00ae), naltrexone (ReVia\u00ae), or related\n             compounds.\n\n          2. Conditions that affected the absorption, metabolism, or passage of drugs out of the\n             body (eg, sprue, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, colitis, liver, kidney, or thyroid\n             conditions).\n\n          3.
