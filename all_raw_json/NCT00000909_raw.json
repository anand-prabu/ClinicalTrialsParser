This study will also determine if\n      IL-2 given alone can increase CD4 cell counts or decrease the level of HIV in the blood.\n\n      IL-2 (a protein found in the blood that helps boost the immune system) can result in\n      increases in CD4 cell count  (immune system cells that fight infection). IL-2 is normally\n      given in combination with antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV infection;  however, some HIV\n      patients do not wish to take antiretrovirals.  This study asks if it is safe and effective\n      to take IL-2 alone to treat HIV infection."

            "textblock": "Previous studies have shown that interleukin-2, when given under the skin, results in CD4+\n      cell count increases, and may impact upon disease progression.  A Phase III trial is the\n      next step in the development of these efficacy trials.  One question, however, has not been\n      addressed in previous IL-2 studies: whether it is both safe and reasonable to allow\n      prospective IL-2 recipients the autonomy of choosing whether or not to take antiretrovirals\n      in addition to their cytokine therapy.  This trial addresses that concern.\n\n      In this open-label study, 36 patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups of 12\n      patients each:\n\n      Group I: IL-2 every 12 hours for 5 days every 8 weeks. Group II: IL-2 every 12 hours for 5\n      days every 8 weeks (higher IL-2 dose). Group III: Control group receiving no therapy.\n      Patients must complete a minimum of 3 8-week cycles of treatment. Twelve patients are\n      randomized to each arm. Following study completion, Group I and II patients may elect to\n      continue receiving IL-2 during follow-up or as part of an additional protocol based on the\n      results of this study.\n\n      [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/12/99: Patients who have received study medication and/or routine\n      protocol visits and procedures for at least 6 months with acceptable compliance are eligible\n      for continued follow-up in an extension phase.  The extension phase will continue for at\n      least 1 year from the date when the last patient has been enrolled in the extension phase.\n      Patients originally randomized to IL-2 may continue to receive IL-2 during the extension\n      period, with IL-2 therapy guided on an individual basis. Patients originally randomized to\n      no therapy may continue to receive no therapy during the extension phase.] [AS PER AMENDMENT\n      7/11/00: Patients demonstrating acceptable compliance with routine visits and procedures\n      during the initial treatment phase and/or extension phase may participate in the long-term\n      follow-up phase which requires follow-up visits at least every 4 months for approximately 5\n      years. Patients originally randomized to Group 1 or 2 may continue to receive IL-2, with\n      IL-2 therapy guided on an individual basis, during the long-term follow-up phase. Patients\n      originally randomized to Group 3 may continue to receive no therapy during the long-term\n      follow-up phase.]"
