  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, long-term study testing the long-term safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of Givinostat in patients with Polycythemia Vera, Essential
      Thrombocythemia, primary Myelofibrosis, Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis, Post-Essential
      Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis following core protocols in chronic myeloproliferative
      neoplasms and/or patient-named compassionate use program. Patients will continue at their
      last tolerable dose and treatment schedule of Givinostat monotherapy. If patients previously
      received Givinostat in combination with other drugs during a core protocol or a
      compassionate use program, they will be treated at the last tolerable dose of the
      combination. Assessment of safety and efficacy will be performed at each quarterly visit and
      each visit will also include laboratory tests and ECG examination. During the visits the
      clinical benefit will be assessed by Investigator according to the revised European
      LeukemiaNet response criteria. The dose of Givinostat will be modified for protocol
      specified toxicities. The treatment may continue up to Marketing Authorization of
      Givinostat. Patients may discontinue study treatment at any time and remain on study therapy
      as long as they derive clinical benefit. Safety will be monitored at each visit throughout
      the entire duration of the study. In case the approved label will not cover the whole study
      population, Givinostat will be provided by the Sponsor to those patients not fulfilling the
      criteria for the approved label of the drug that are still deriving benefit from Givinostat
      at the time of its commercial availability.

    <description>To obtain information on the long-term efficacy of Givinostat in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms following core protocols or compassionate use program:
Number of patients experiencing adverse events;
Type, incidence, and severity of treatment-related adverse events.
To determine the long term safety and tolerability of Givinostat in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms following core protocols or compassionate use program:
For Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia, Complete response and partial response rate according to the revised clinico-haematological European LeukemiaNet response criteria;
For Myelofibrosis, complete response, major response, moderate response and minor response rate according to European Myelofibrosis Network response criteria.
Note that these assessment will be repeated periodically (each 3 months) during the study. In fact, the treatment will continue up to Marketing Authorisation of Givinostat.</description>
