  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple  ascending single study. It
      is hypothesised that at least dose of DS-1093a will be safe and tolerable over a 2-week
      treatment period and will result in increases in reticulocyte count and haemoglobin
      concentrations in healthy male volunteers

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects, aged 18-45 years.

          -  Willing to use a reliable method of contraception during the trial, and for 4 months
             afterwards

          -  Sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the trial and any hazards of
             participating in it.  Ability to communicate satisfactorily with the Investigator and
             to participate in, and comply with the requirements of, the entire trial.

          -  Willingness to give written consent to participate after reading the information and

             Investigator or his delegate.

          -  Willingness to give written consent to have data entered into The Overvolunteering
             Prevention System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal medical history, physical findings, electrocardiogram
             (ECG), or laboratory values at the pre-trial screening assessment that could
             interfere with the objectives of the trial or the safety of the volunteer.

          -  Presence of acute or chronic illness or history of chronic illness (particularly
             hypertension, seizures, kidney disease or liver disease, including known or newly
             discovered Gilbert's syndrome) sufficient to invalidate the volunteer's participation
             in the trial or make it unnecessarily hazardous.

          -  Impaired endocrine, thyroid, hepatic, respiratory or renal function, diabetes
             mellitus, coronary heart disease, or history of psychotic mental illness.

          -  Presence or history of malignant disease, other than basal cell carcinoma that was
             successfully treated at least 5 years ago.

          -  History of gastric or duodenal ulcer.

          -  History of treatment with, or use of, an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (e.g. EPO).

          -  Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in supine position at the screening examination
             outside the ranges 90-140 mm Hg systolic, 40-90 mm Hg diastolic; heart rate 40-100

             ferritin levels.

             medicines.

          -  Presence or history of significant hypersensitive or allergic reaction to any drug,

             other over-the-counter medicine, with the exception of acetaminophen (paracetamol),
             during the 7 days before the first dose of trial medication.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription
             medicine within the previous 3 months, or unwilling to abstain from participating in
             other clinical trials during the study and for 3 months after receipt of the final
             dose of trial medication.

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV 1 &amp; HIV 2.

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol during the 2 years before the first dose of trial
             medication.

          -  Evidence of drug or alcohol abuse at screening, or intake of more than 21 units of
             alcohol weekly.

          -  Use of tobacco or nicotine-containing products during the 3 months before the first
             dose of trial medication.

          -  Loss of more than 400 mL blood, or donation of blood, plasma, platelets, or any other
             blood components, during the 3 months before the trial, or unwilling to abstain from
             donating during the study and for 3 months after receipt of the final dose of trial
             medication.

          -  Possibility that the volunteer will not cooperate with the requirements of the
             protocol.
