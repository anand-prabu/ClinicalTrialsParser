ASIS device creates that bloodless space,\n      enhancing Enbrel's efficacy and preventing unnecessary distant spread and adverse reactions.\n      This space remains bloodless as long as the skin is lifted up or filled with an injectable\n      product. Although ASIS device was initially designed to best administer BOTOX for such\n      muscular conditions as Upper limb Spasticity, Cervical Dystonia, Chronic Migraine,\n      Strabismus, Blepharospasm, and Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis, the technology will also\n      benefit other injectable products, including: GAMMAGARD for Primary Immunodeficiency (PI)\n      and Insulin for Diabetics, etc."

            "textblock": "Over 6 months, Aim 1 will demonstrate that ASIS device consistently delivers an injectable\n      product (e.g. Gadolinium) into that subdermal bloodless space. MRI is the most simple and\n      logical imaging choice, preferred because with ultrasound, air is injected, which will\n      dissipate too quickly out of bloodless space to allow measurements. Since there isn't a way\n      to measure the level of Gadolinium within that subdermal bloodless space, at least the\n      Prolongation of Gadolinium may be approximated by its greater or longer Persistent % on MRI.\n      Also, since we can't assume that bloodless space for patients with a particular disease will\n      behave the same way as normal patients or patients with different diseases, this\n      approximation only works if the variables are minimized to the same particular skin affected\n      by Plaque Psoriasis. Case in point, patients with Plaque Psoriasis tend to have thicker\n      skin, so expectantly will have prolonged Gadolinium subcutaneously Persistent %, which may\n      be very different from the other diseases and certainly from the skin of normal patients,\n      while the Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % should remain the same. Therefore, the\n      Relative Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent\n      % subcutaneously, will be different and very specific for the particular skin affected by\n      Plaque Psoriasis. However, they are valuable indicators that will help us modify the Enbrel\n      dosage and duration to inject into that \"unknown\" subdermal space for Aim 2, from the\n      \"known\" typical Enbrel dosage and duration for Plaque Psoriasis patients. For example, if\n      Aim 1 found the Relative Prolongation Ability Score for the Plaque Psoriasis skin to be\n      (2.00), then the typical subcutaneously Enbrel 50mg every 3 days, should be 25mg every 6\n      days subdermally.\n\n      Over 12 months, Aim 2 will again demonstrate the advantages of ASIS device injecting\n      subdermally versus subcutaneously, but using Enbrel instead of Gadolinium on the particular\n      skin affected by Plaque Psoriasis. Once we have shown ASIS device's consistent performance\n      in Aim 1, then we may assume will deliver another product (Enbrel) into that bloodless space\n      without the need to measure Enbrel's existent in that bloodless space. Using Enbrel instead\n      of Gadolinium, we'll demonstrate the advantages of injecting subdermally over\n      intramuscularly for the same affected skin sites in the same 60 adult subjects."

However, the Pharmacokinetics of subdermally injected Enbrel will be just dependent on Enbrel's diffusion out of that subdermal bloodless space. Therefore, if Enbrel getting into the bloodstream becomes so severely inhibited, then we can just change the osmolality of Enbrel in the end. Response to treatment will be assessed after 3, 6 and 9 months of therapy, and defined as the patients who achieved a reduction in score of at least 75% from baseline by the PASI.8 Other therapeutic advantages of ASIS device subdermally over subcutaneously will also be studied by comparing the reduction of adverse reactions and injection site pain.",
