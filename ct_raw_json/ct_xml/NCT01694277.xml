  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GISTs are uncommon visceral sarcomas that arise predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract.
      Most GIST cells are positive for c-kit (CD117), a cell surface antigen corresponding to the
      Stem Cell Factor (SCF) receptor. The receptor has an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK)
      joined by a juxtamembrane domain. It is hypothesized that all malignant GIST cells harbor a
      mutation of c-kit, resulting in the activation of c-kit and cell division and tumour growth.

      Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in GISTs. Masitinib
      (AB1010) is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-kit. Imatinib is also a
      TK inhibitor indicated in the treatment of GIST. It might be associated with side effects
      and patients might develop a resistance to treatment over time. Based on pre-clinical and
      clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate in the second
      line treatment of patients with GIST after progression with imatinib.
