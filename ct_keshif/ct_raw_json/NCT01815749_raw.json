Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant helps stop\n      the growth of cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the\n      patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white\n      blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune\n      response against the body's normal cells. Removing the T cells from the donor cells before\n      transplant may stop this from happening. Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor\n      lymphocyte infusion) later may help the patient's immune system see any remaining cancer\n      cells as not belonging in the patient's body and destroy them (called graft-versus-tumor\n      effect)"
