      The purpose of the study is to examine if blood flow in the brain before coronary artery
      bypass graft surgery has an effect on depression after surgery.

      The main hypothesis of the study states that pre-surgical blood flow in the brain will be an
      independent risk factor for depression after surgery after adjusting for other risk factors
      such as gender, pre-CABG depression, social support, medical comorbidity burden,
      socioeconomic status, and neuroticism.
