This study will involve 30\n      randomized patients to take part in the out-patient exercise program and 30 patients to\n      continue with their regular activities over a 6-month period. Once that period is over, half\n      of the 30 patients who participated in the outpatient exercise program will continue in the\n      program and the other half will be randomized to independently continue to exercise. The\n      investigators hypothesize that exercising will benefit the patient by slowing the dementia\n      process, improving behavioral symptoms, and decreasing volume loss of certain brain regions.\n      Each person will perform personalized exercise regimens, MR imaging and neuropsychological\n      tests will be used to measure the benefits of exercise. Ultimately, the hope is that the\n      results of this study could be used to facilitate exercise programs for patients. Enrollment\n      is completely voluntary and all personal data obtained will remain confidential."

Age 60 to 80 inclusive\n\n          4. Mobility, preserved vision and hearing (eyeglasses and/or hearing aid are\n             permissible) sufficient for compliance with testing procedures\n\n          5. Ability to tolerate and perform aerobic exercise program (as per The Canadian Society\n             for Exercise Physiology; all patients above the age of 69 embarking on a new exercise\n             routine should have the \"Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination\" (PARmed-X)\n             form completed by their family physician. All patients being asked to enroll in the\n             study will have their PCPs fill out this form to ensure the patient is able to\n             withstand the exercise program.

Ability to speak and understand the English language (as questionnaires and tests are\n             only available in English)\n\n        Inclusion criteria for the caregivers will be as follows:\n\n          1. Being the primary caregiver for a given patient\n\n          2. Ability to speak and understand English (as questionnaires and tests are only\n             available in English)\n\n          3.

Severe aphasia (semantic word loss)\n\n          4. Visual deficits requiring correction beyond the use of eyeglasses or contact lenses\n             (intact visual acuity is required for completing both the questionnaires and the\n             emotion evaluation test which consists of video vignettes)\n\n          5. Hearing problems requiring correction beyond hearing aids (videos have an auditory\n             component)\n\n        Exclusion Criteria for Patients:\n\n          1. Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, metal\n             pieces or objects in the eyes, skin or body will be excluded as they will be unable\n             to have a MRI scan\n\n          2.
