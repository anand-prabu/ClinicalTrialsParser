  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of groups for breast cancer survivors: a
      Meaning-Centered Group and a Discussion Group. Many breast cancer survivors seek help to
      deal with the emotional burden of having gone through the cancer experience. Participation
      in groups offering support often helps cancer survivors cope with stressors of life after
      having had cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. The &quot;Meaning-Centered
      Group&quot; is intended to teach breast cancer survivors how to maintain or even increase a sense
      of meaning and purpose in their lives after treatment for cancer. The &quot;Discussion Group&quot; is
      intended to help breast cancer survivors cope by giving them a place to get support from
      other breast cancer survivors.

      The goal of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of group approaches for
      breast cancer survivors. The study is also testing the benefits and feasibility of
      conducting the groups virtually using a telephone and computer.

    <description>DG is a standardized, manualized group developed by the MSKCC Psychiatry Service and utilized in a similar form in our completed and ongoing RCTs of MCGP. Based on models described by Rogers and Bloch, the essential components include reassurance, explanation, education, encouragement, and permission for expression. The process emphasizes Rogerian concepts (e.g., empathic understanding) and avoids techniques that are not exclusively supportive. The content focuses on education about here-and-now topics relevant to BCS (e.g., maintaining and eliciting social support, financial strains, return to work, physical symptom management), allowing emotional expression and discussion of difficult topics.</description>

             the medical record at MSKCC by self-report, or by outside correspondence, including a
             study checklist signed by a physician for patients outside of MSKCC

          -  &gt;3 months from completion of treatment (may be on hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen)
             as confirmed by the medical record at MSKCC, by self-report, or by outside
             correspondence, including a study checklist signed by a physician for patients
             outside of MSKCC

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Access to a telephone, computer, and Internet

        For Phase 2 only:

          -  A score of &gt; or = to 4 on the Distress Thermometer (DT) and indication that this

          -  If taking medication for mood, anxiety, depression, thoughts, sensory experiences
             such as hallucinations, or sleep, stable and consistent enough in dosage and use of
             that medication  so as to not result in a clinically significant change as determined
             by the study PI/co-PI or, confirmed by reports in the medical record at MSKCC, by
             selfreport, or by outside correspondence, including a study checklist signed by a
             physician for patients outside of MSKCC

          -  Did not participate in Phase 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current evidence of, treatment for, or a history of recurrence/metastasis of an other
             type of cancer EXCEPT basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin as confirmed by
             the medical record at MSKCC, by self-report, or by outside correspondence

          -  Significant psychiatric or cognitive disturbance sufficient, in the investigator's
             judgment, to preclude providing informed consent or participating in the groups
             (i.e., acute psychiatric symptoms which require individual treatment).
