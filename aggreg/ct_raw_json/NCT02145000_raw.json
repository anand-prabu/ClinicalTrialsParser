The first administration will occur at\n      6-8 weeks of age.\n\n      We hypothesize a difference in vaccine efficacy of three doses of BRV-PV vaccine vs. placebo\n      against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in healthy infants in Niger.\n\n      Active surveillance for gastroenteritis episodes will be conducted throughout the trial.\n      Surveillance for adverse events will be carried out among all children from the time of\n      first vaccination and 28 days post-Dose 3.  Surveillance for all serious adverse events,\n      including intussusception and death, will be conducted on all participants until they each\n      reach two years of age.\n\n      To assess the effect of prenatal nutrition supplementation on infant immune response to the\n      BRV-PV vaccine, study villages in the immunogenicity sub-cohort will be randomized in a\n      1:1:1 ratio to provide pregnant women with daily iron-folate, multiple micronutrients or a\n      lipid-based nutrition supplement.  Infants of participating women, if eligible at 6-8 weeks\n      of age, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive three doses of vaccine or placebo and\n      enter the main trial as part of the immunogenicity sub-cohort."
