This offers the\n      following advantages: i) providing data on a particularly important population, i.e.,\n      subjects who are at the inception of treatment for a psychotic disorder and who are likely\n      to remain on a given drug on a long-term basis; ii) its inclusion in a rich clinical\n      setting, with a clinical team dedicated to provide innovative interventions; iii) its\n      naturalistic design, that will allow to obtain data that will be applicable to \"real-life\"\n      clinical settings; indeed, subjects who will be switched to asenapine within the current\n      project are those we would switch to this drug in our daily practice."
