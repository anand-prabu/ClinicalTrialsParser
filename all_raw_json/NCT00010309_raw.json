            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and the maximum tolerated dose of vaccines containing\n      two adenoviral vectors encoding the melanoma antigens Melan-A/MART-1 and gp100 in patients\n      with stage II-IV melanoma. II. Assess the dose-response changes in the frequency of MART-1\n      and gp100 reactive T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) in patients receiving one of three different\n      vaccine regimens. III. Assess the T-cell response to one melanoma antigen following three\n      treatments with the other antigen in these patients. IV. Assess the effect of concomitant\n      vaccination with both antigens on T-cell response in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients are sequentially enrolled on 1 of 3\n      treatment arms. Each treatment arm has 3 groups. Arm I: Patients receive Ad2/MART-1v2\n      vaccine and Ad2/gp100v2 vaccine intradermally (ID) at the lowest dose level once every three\n      weeks for either 6 or 15 weeks depending on assignment. Arm II: Patients receive Ad2/gp100v2\n      vaccine and Ad2/MART-1v2 vaccine ID at the mid-range dose level once every three weeks for\n      either 6 or 15 weeks depending on assignment. Arm III: Patients receive Ad2/MART-1v2 vaccine\n      and Ad2/gp100v2 vaccine ID at the highest dose level once every three weeks for either 6 or\n      15 weeks depending on assignment. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of\n      Ad2/MART-1v2 and/or Ad2/gp100v2 vaccines in each arm until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\n      is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year\n      after completion of treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued over 1 year."
