Each participant will undergo two calcium absorption tests,\n      one with a micronutrient supplement powder containing non-encapsulated (non-coated) calcium\n      and the other with a micronutrient supplement powder containing encapsulated calcium at the\n      same dose. The absorption tests will be separated by a 2-week washout period. Fractional\n      calcium absorption will be measured using the dual stable isotope method. For each test, the\n      formulation will be administered orally for 9 days; on the 10th day, a 44Ca- labeled stable\n      isotope will be given orally and a 42Ca-labeled stable isotope dose will be given\n      intravenously. Urine will be collected for 48 hours to measure calcium absorption."
