While early clinical trials have shown that\n      30 mg/kg/week of DHPG is usually sufficient to delay or prevent relapse, neutropenia is a\n      common dose-limiting problem in about 50 percent of patients. Since in vitro data have\n      suggested that there is synergism between DHPG and interferon beta against cytomegalovirus,\n      a reduced dose of DHPG in combination with a low dose of interferon beta may prevent relapse\n      without causing neutropenia. If remission can be maintained with low-dose DHPG and\n      interferon beta, maintenance therapy with a moderate dose of interferon beta alone will be\n      evaluated in a subsequent protocol."
