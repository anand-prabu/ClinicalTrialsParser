Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.\n      Colony-stimulating factors may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects\n      of chemotherapy. Combining these treatments may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy using\n      donated tumor cells treated with interferon alfa and radiation therapy and cyclophosphamide\n      plus GM-CSF in treating patients with advanced pancreatic cancer."

Determine the feasibility, toxicity, and antitumor effects of active specific\n      intralymphatic immunotherapy with allogeneic pancreatic cancer cells treated with interferon\n      alfa plus low-dose adjuvant systemic sargramostim (GM-CSF) and cyclophosphamide in patients\n      with incurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. II. Assess the immunologic and biologic correlates\n      of this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Cultured allogeneic pancreatic cancer cells are incubated with interferon alfa for\n      72-96 hours. Autologous cell lines, if established, may be used as an alternative. The cells\n      are irradiated immediately prior to use. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day -3 and\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 0-8. On day 0, patients receive viable tumor\n      cells via dorsal pedal lymphatic cannulation. Treatment repeats every 2-4 weeks for a\n      minimum of 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      are followed every 2-4 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients will be accrued for this study."
