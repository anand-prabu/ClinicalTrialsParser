The  vaccine is combined\n      with an oral medication called beta glucan, an over the counter oral dietary supplement that\n      may also stimulate the immune system in ways that helps the body eradicate cancer cells and\n      reduce risk of recurrent cancer. The primary purpose of this study is to measure the changes\n      in the number of immune cells that might help lower risk of cancer recurrence. The\n      investigators do not yet know if the vaccine is effective in fighting cancer and will not\n      know at the end of this study whether this has been of benefit."
