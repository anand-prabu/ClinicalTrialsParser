            "textblock": "The mainstay of maintenance immunosuppression post-transplantation includes a calcineurin\n      inhibitor, either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. The introduction of calcineurin inhibitors led\n      to a significant improvement in graft and patient outcomes post solid organ transplantation.\n      However, one of the severe limitations of this class of drugs, is its associated\n      nephrotoxicity. Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients reveal that the\n      incidence of stage 4 chronic kidney disease  or stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) after\n      Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) at 1, 3, and 5 years is 8%, 14%, and 18%,\n      respectively, increasing to approximately 25% by 10 years after transplantation.Furthermore,\n      renal dysfunction is associated with a four-fold increase in patient mortality post solid\n      organ transplantation.\n\n      Several calcineurin inhibitor sparing and minimizing regimens have been studied. Most\n      recently, in the phase III, randomized study in de novo liver transplant\n      recipients,demonstrated significantly improved renal function in the tacrolimus minimization\n      arm (everolimus plus tacrolimus one year post transplant.In fact superior renal function was\n      achieved with the tacrolimus minimization arm one month after randomization and was\n      maintained to Month 12. With this pilot study, we aim to compare the efficacy of the\n      standard immunosupression post liver transplant with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid\n      (Myfortic)with calcineurin sparing regimen using the combination of everolimus and enteric\n      coated mycophenolic acid, as determined by the estimated Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at\n      one year post transplant, with acceptable rates of biopsy proven rejection."
