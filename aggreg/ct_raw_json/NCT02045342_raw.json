SuperStarch, originally developed as a drink for children with glycogen storage\n      disease, is a slow digestible carbohydrate, maintaining blood sugar levels over extended\n      periods. Therefore, it could be beneficial to exercise and mental performance, and could\n      possibly have fat loss effects by increasing feelings of fullness. In this study, measures\n      will be taken in 25 men to assess mental function, appetite, and metabolism to determine the\n      processes involved in possible fat loss."
