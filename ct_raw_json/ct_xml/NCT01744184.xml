  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether Entonox (gas and air) is at least as good as
      intravenous midazolam in providing analgesia and sedation during gastroscopy. Entonox is
      used as an adjunct in lower gastrointestinal procedures but is not routinely used in
      gastroscopy, and there is only one similar published study to date, which was performed in
      children. The main advantage of Entonox over midazolam is the quick recovery time following
      withdrawal of the agent, which enables patients to return to independent normal life. The
      investigators would like to be able to offer Entonox to patients as an option for sedation
      during gastroscopy, this study is being conducted to determine if it is a safe and feasible
      option.

    <description>midazolam sedation combined with pharyngeal anaesthesia
Participants randomized to receive midazolam will have an intravenous cannula sited and, following the administration of xylocaine throat spray as above, will be put into the left lateral position. They will then be given up to 5mg midazolam as appropriate to achieve conscious sedation as for standard protocol in endoscopy.</description>

    <description>Entonox combined with pharyngeal anaesthesia.
Pharyngeal anaesthesia, given as 8-16 sprays of xylocaine to the pharynx; 3 minutes will be given to allow the pharynx to become anaesthetized.
Participants randomized to receive Entonox will be given the 50:50 nitrous oxide:oxygen mix via a mouthpiece with a demand valve system, once in position for the procedure. Inhalations will be given for 3-5 minutes (or until the participant feels adequately sedated) measured using a stopwatch. Oxygen will be given at 2 litres per minute via nasal cannulae during the procedure, (standard care for sedated procedures). The endoscopist will then proceed to intubate the cricopharynx and perform the procedure in the standard manner.</description>
