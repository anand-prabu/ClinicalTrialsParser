Hormone therapy using\n      exemestane plus goserelin may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exemestane and goserelin in treating\n      premenopausal women who have metastatic breast cancer that has not responded to previous\n      tamoxifen."

Determine the efficacy of exemestane and goserelin in premenopausal women\n      with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer after tamoxifen failure. II.\n      Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the hormonal\n      profile of patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the predictive value of HER-2,\n      epidermal growth factor receptor, and estrogen receptor for response in patients treated\n      with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral exemestane daily on days 1-28 and goserelin subcutaneously on\n      day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
