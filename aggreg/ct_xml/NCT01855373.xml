      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design to evaluate
      the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of the study substances utilized to support
      improved healthy levels of blood sugar and endothelial function.  Each subject will be
      randomized to receive a specific dose of PEAK ATP® (Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate Disodium
      Salt)with GlycoCarn® (Glycine Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride, USP (United States
      Pharmacopeia) , PEAK ATP® (Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate Disodium Salt) and GlycoCarn® (Glycine
      Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride, USP )or Placebo twice daily.

      Participants will undergo assessment of blood tests, brachial ultrasound for determining the
      change in flow mediated dilation, body weight, % body fat, BMI, waist/hip circumference and
      blood pressure.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness
      of PEAK ATP® with GlycoCarn®, PEAK ATP® and GlycoCarn®  on improving levels of blood sugar
      via assessment of plasma glucose.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To assess flow-mediated dilation as determined by brachial ultrasound evaluation.

        2. To assess the effect on changes in blood levels of HbA1C, high-sensitivity C-Reactive
           Protein (hs-CRP), Insulin, Nitric Oxide (NOx), Malondialdehyde (MAL), Soluble
           Inter-cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and E-Selectin.

        3. To assess the effect on body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), % body fat as measured by
           skin caliper, waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure.

        4. To assess the effect on general and sexual health for males and females as determined
           through questionnaires.
