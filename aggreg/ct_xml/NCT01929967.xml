  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim with this study is to investigate the mechanisms of immune deficiency
      in patients with heterotaxy syndrome through the use of novel biomarkers and a prospective
      questionnaire survey documenting the burden of infectious sequelae following enrollment. It
      is known that patients with under-active spleens (functional asplenia or hyposplenia)
      secondary to other (non-cardiac) conditions such as Sickle Cell Disease or Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease have a characteristic paucity of a B cell sub-class known as IgM memory B
      cell. This specific sub-class of B cell normally matures in the spleen and in those with an
      improperly functioning spleen a significant deficiency of this B cell class is seen on flow
      cytometry.

      Similarly, these same patients are noted to have increased amounts of 'junk' DNA / nuclear
      remnant in their red cells. This is seen on microscopy as a dark particle inside the red
      cell and is termed a Howell Jolly Body (normally less than 2% of red cells have these dark
      particles present). Part of a functioning spleen's normal task is to rid the blood of red
      cells that contain nuclear remnants and an under-active spleen gets behind on this task with
      a build-up of Howell Jolly Bodies in red cells present in the bloodstream. Flow cytometry
      can very quickly and accurately quantify Howell Jolly Bodies as well as IgM memory B cells
      from a small (~1.5cc) sample of blood. Normal IgM memory B cell ranges are known for healthy
      children from infancy onwards allowing interpretation of results against normative data
      ranges.

      The investigators aim to enroll 10 patients in this pilot study who have a diagnosis of
      heterotaxy syndrome (both asplenia and polysplenia) and to prospectively follow them after
      obtaining the initial biomarker sample. The family will be contacted once every two weeks
      for a period of 12 weeks and asked a series of simple questions taking approximately 5
      minutes on any recent infectious sequelae or symptoms. The questions will elucidate history
      of minor illness such as low-grade fever or cough to more significant events such as
      admission for in-patient antibiotic therapy of bacterial sepsis. Ultimately, with this pilot
      study, the investigators hope to obtain sufficient data to support funding applications for
      a larger, multi-center trial that will allow us to develop biomarker thresholds for future
      risk of sepsis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of heterotaxy syndrome, as objectively defined by visceral heterotaxy
             (malrotation, interrupted inferior vena cava) with either documented polysplenia or
             asplenia by radiological imaging.

          -  0-12 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other known immunodeficiency or hyposplenic states (22q11, hypogammaglobulinemia,
             sickle hemoglobinopathy, liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension, organ
             transplantation, Fanconi syndrome, HIV or AIDS, chronic corticosteroid use, cancer,
             chemotherapy or other immunomodulating drug exposure, Addison's disease or
             pan-hypopituitarism, surgical splenectomy).

          -  Red blood cell transfusion within the last 90 days as the donated red blood cells may
             interfere with calculation of the subject's Howell Jolly Body count. Patient
             enrollment will be deferred until 90 days has elapsed, assuming other eligibility
             requirements are met.
