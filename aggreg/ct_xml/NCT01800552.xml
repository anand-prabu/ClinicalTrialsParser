      The purpose of this study is to determine whether commercial ultrasound imaging systems can
      discern normal from infiltrated tissue near a peripheral intravenous site.

    <textblock>
      Peripheral intravenous (PIV) therapy is one of the most common invasive procedures performed
      in US hospitals. A majority of hospital patients require intravenous therapy each year in
      the United States. Despite widespread use, a number of potential complications can occur
      during PIV therapy.  One of the most common causes of IV complications is IV infiltration or
      extravasation.  Infiltration is the leakage of non-vesicant fluids like saline into the
      surrounding tissue. Extravasation is the leakage of vesicant fluids, which include cytotoxic
      drugs, intravenous nutrition, and calcium, potassium, and bicarbonate solutions. If not
      detected and corrected early, infiltration and extravasation can lead to significant
      complications such as severe inflammation, compartment syndrome, and skin necrosis.

      ivWatch, LLC has developed an investigational device that may detect IV infiltration and
      extravasation occurrences using a near infrared light sensor. Previous studies have
      evaluated the performance of the ivWatch device by comparing to a nurse's diagnosis. The
      nursing standard of care relies on tactile and visual indicators to diagnose an infiltration
      event. The ivWatch product often signals an infiltration event before these indicators are
      apparent to clinicians.  Consequently, comparisons to the nurse's diagnosis often lead to
      questionable false positives for the ivWatch device. A better reference is required to
      evaluate the performance of the ivWatch device.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the ability of ultrasound to detect PIV
      infiltrations. Ultrasound is a depth-resolved imaging technique for evaluating tissue
      microstructure. Researchers have used ultrasound to examine exogenous fluids injected into
      cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. Ultrasound has been used to detect small volumes of
      fluids such as cosmetic fillers and subcutaneous injections. These studies suggest
      ultrasound may be a potential reference standard for future evaluation of ivWatch devices.

    <description>Ultrasound images are acquired before and after the induced infiltration on the test arm. Two additional ultrasound images are acquired from the normal control arm. At the end of the study, the before and after images from the test and control arms are evaluated and classified by clinicians blinded to the state of the tissue. Sensitivity and specificity metrics are used to evaluate the performance of ultrasound imaging for assessing peripheral IV infiltration.</description>
