All subjects must agree to use acceptable methods of contraception for the\n             duration of the study.\n\n          -  Subjects must have read, understood, and signed an institutional review board\n             (IRB)-approved Informed Consent Form (ICF).\n\n          -  Subjects must be able and willing to comply with protocol requirements.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Subject with any systemic conditions that could compromise wound healing and preclude\n             periodontal surgery (ie, bleeding disorder, cancer, except localized basal cell or\n             squamous cell cancer of the skin with no metastasis; human immunodeficiency virus; or\n             bone metabolic diseases [ie, osteoporosis or Paget's disease]).\n\n          -  Subject who is currently receiving, anticipates receiving or has received within 30\n             days prior to Day 0: inhaled or systemic corticosteroids (ie, oral, IV),\n             immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, which could\n             compromise wound healing and preclude periodontal surgery.\n\n          -  Subject who has had oral/periodontal surgery within 30 days prior to Day 0 or\n             anticipates having oral/periodontal surgery within 30 days after Day 0.\n\n          -  Subject with acute mucosal infection, including suppuration or induration in the area\n             of intended surgery.\n\n          -  Subject, who in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, will require a sinus lift\n             procedure to place dental implants in the surgical area.\n\n          -  Subject without at least 1 tooth adjacent to the area to be treated.\n\n          -  Subject has a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the previous 12 months of\n             Screening that could interfere with study compliance or protocol requirements.\n\n          -  Subject who has used any tobacco product within 6 months of Screening.\n\n          -  Subject with known hypersensitivity to porcine or bovine collagen, gentamicin or\n             surfactants.\n\n          -  Subject who has received an investigational drug, device, or biological/bioactive\n             treatment within 30 days prior to Day 0 (medical or dental).\n\n          -  Subject who was previously treated with Gintuit, or any other cell therapy at the\n             target treatment site or immediately adjacent teeth.\n\n          -  Female subject that is lactating.\n\n          -  Subject, who in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, for any reason other than\n             those listed above, will not be able to complete the study per protocol."
