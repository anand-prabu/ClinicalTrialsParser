HER2+ describes cancer cells that\n      have too much of a protein called HER2 on their surface. In normal cells, HER2 helps to\n      control cell growth. When it is made in larger than normal amounts by cancer cells, the\n      cells may grow more quickly and be more likely to spread to other parts of the body.\n      Checking to see if a cancer is HER2+ may help plan treatment, which may include drugs that\n      kill HER2+ cancer cells. Ganetespib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of\n      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in\n      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping\n      them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block the ability of\n      tumors to grow and spread. Giving ganetespib with paclitaxel and trastuzumab may be an\n      effective treatment for patients with HER2+ breast cancer."
