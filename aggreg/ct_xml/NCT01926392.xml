  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial thickness burns are a common, painful injury requiring a great deal of resources in
      their care. Silver sulfadizine is a commonly-used topical antimicrobial, but is difficult to
      remove due to its lipid base. We are comparing a water-based topical antimicrobial therapy
      to silver sulfadiazine and hypothesize that the water-based therapy is superior in terms of
      pain control and resources required to deliver care.
