  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research is to evaluate the physical changes that occur over
      time after fat grafting for craniofacial trauma. This protocol is similar to an existing
      study (IRB# PRO0906101) presently conducted at the University of Pittsburgh by the same
      research team which utilizes fat grafts. The preparation of the fat graft material in each
      clinical trial is processed differently evaluating the effects of graft resorption after
      treatment.

      The primary objective of the proposed clinical investigation of the Tissue Genesis Cell
      Isolation System™ (CIS) device constitutes a feasibility study directed at an initial
      evaluation of the device in a certain clinical population, namely subjects undergoing
      craniofacial fat grafting.

        1. Treat disfiguring craniofacial injuries in 5 subjects with fat grafting enhanced with
           adipose SVF via TGI 1000 isolation methods to improve form with a high level of
           precision. Facial appearance and persistence of treatment effect will be assessed using
           aesthetic grading scales, state of the art 3D photography, and high resolution CT
           scanning with 3D reconstruction. Patients will be followed for 24 months after
           treatment to define long term outcomes.

        2. Assess biologic properties of the cells within the fat graft and correlate with
           clinical outcomes. This will include adipose stem cell yield per volume of fat tissue,
           cell proliferation, capacity for adipogenic differentiation, lipolysis, and cell
           sub-population analysis by multiparameter flow cytometry. Results of these assays will
           be correlated with graft volume retention to search for predictors of good clinical
           outcome that are related to variation on adipose biology between subjects.

        3. Measure quality of life in patients before and after autologous fat grafting using
           validated psychosocial measures.

    <description>In this study, we will concentrate the adipose stromal cells (ASCs) in the fat graft material to assess whether this modification will increase fat graft retention over time. The concentrated fat to be injected into the subject from the fat grafting procedure will be processed by the Tissue Genesis Cell Isolation System™ (CIS) device. The volume retention in areas treated with ASC concentrated fat grafts will be compared with regions treated with standard fat grafts in the same patient. Additionally, data from our current study assessing volume retention after fat grafting for facial deformities (IRB # PRO09060101) will be used for comparison.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Subjects who are male or female, military or civilian, 18 years of age or older
             and able to provide informed consent

             2. Have suffered injury resulting in craniofacial volume defects which could be
             treated with a graft volume of between 3 and 100 cc of lipoaspirate

             3. Be at least 3 months post-injury or post-surgery (from trauma procedures) so that
             acute edema is resolved

             4. Volume defects are covered by intact skin and do not communicate with oral cavity
             or sinuses

             5. The three dimensional geometry of the volume defects would allow for treatment
             with lipoaspirate injection so that at least two distinct treated areas could be
             discerned on gross examination and radiographically (e.g. treated regions are on
             opposite sides of the face, on lower face versus upper face, or separated by a bony
             landmark such as zygoma. This would include the ability to treat uninjured regions
             with fat grafts in order to obtain symmetry or balance.

             6. Subjects who are, in the opinion of the Investigator, able to understand the
             study, comply with the study design and are willing to return to the clinic for all
             the research required follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Craniofacial defects intended for treatment have open wounds or communicate with
             oral cavity or sinus (note: presence of such a defect in the setting of another
             defect(s) that meets treatment criteria will not exclude the patient from
             participating).

             2. Active infection anywhere in the body

             3. Diagnosis of cancer within last 12 months and /or actively receiving chemotherapy
             or radiation treatment

             4. Subjects with known idiopathic or drug-associated coagulopathy assessed by
             screening history and physical examination.

             5. Subjects who have, as determined by the investigator a history or clinical
             manifestations of significant renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic,
             psychiatric, or other condition that would preclude participation in the study (i.e.
             Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients) or any condition within the last 14 days
             requiring hospitalization or surgical intervention.

             6. Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, and women of child-bearing potential who are
             not abstinent or practicing an acceptable means of contraception, as determined by
             the Investigator, for the duration of the treatment phase

             7. Subjects with known alcohol or narcotic drug dependency

             8. Subjects with a history of abnormal blood biochemistry or any other abnormal
             laboratory findings, as defined by the normal value range within the UPMC
             Laboratory's value references and whose values are considered as determined by the
             investigator to be clinically significant, would render the subject inappropriate for
             the surgical procedures (i.e. CBC with Differential, platelets, comprehensive
             metabolic panel to include electrolytes, bun/creatinine, liver function test and
             coagulation tests). Reference to UPMC Laboratory normal value document (Attachment #
             18)

             9. Subjects with a life expectancy of &lt;9 months, terminal conditions or factors
             making follow-up difficult (e.g. no fixed address, telephone etc)

             10. Subjects with a known allergy to collagenase, an ingredient used by the TGI CIS
             to process the SVF product.

             11. Subjects with an Axis II to diagnosis DSM-IV (e.g., Schizophrenia, Bipolar
             Disorder). Subjects who are found to be stable on medication and receive psychiatric
             clearance could be eligible for study participation per the Physician's discretion.
