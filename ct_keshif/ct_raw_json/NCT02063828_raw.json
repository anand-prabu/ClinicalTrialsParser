To assess feasibility (accrual, participation, adherence, retention) of a randomized\n           study of device-guided breathing and music in 75 post-treatment ESLC survivors with\n           significant anxiety.\n\n        2. To obtain preliminary data on the variability and efficacy of two doses of a\n           device-guided breathing intervention versus a music control group for reducing anxiety\n           (primary outcome) and for improving self-reported dyspnea and respiratory functioning\n           (secondary outcomes) in post-treatment lung cancer survivors.\n\n        3. To select the optimal dose of the device-guided breathing intervention (15 minutes\n           once/day or twice/day) for subsequent randomized study."
