    <textblock>
      CLSI guidelines shall be followed to gather data from a minimum of one hundred and twenty
      normal donors to create reference intervals for various Haemonetics reagents.  Venous blood
      from a minimum of 146 reference subjects shall be tested. Blood from 160 donors will be
      drawn at the study site to account for aberrant or outlying data excluded for technical or
      other reasons.

    <textblock>
      As part of an examination of how LY30 is calculated, the investigators would like to explore
      the differences between Maximum Amplitude (MA) and LY30 calculated in the traditional small
      deviation method and by an absolute MA method.

      The maximum amplitude (MA) for a sample is determined in real-time using one of two
      MA-identifying algorithms: Small Deviation MA (the default algorithm) or Absolute MA.  Both
      algorithms are available in commercially available software.  Both algorithms find an MA for
      a sample; however, the difference between the two algorithms is the &quot;acceptance criteria&quot;
      which each use for identifying the MA.  As compared to Small Deviation MA, the Absolute MA
      has a larger and more stringent rules set.

      A study will be run to establish reference intervals following the guidelines set out in
      CLSI document C28-A3c. This guideline calls for a reference interval to be constructed from
      at least 120 donors.  To meet the guidance outlined in the CLSI guideline, we will collect a
      minimum of 146 donors.
