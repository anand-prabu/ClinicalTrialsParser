  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project involves the assessment of the efficacy of two different image guided
      techniques in patients with low back pain due to arthritis of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ).
      Intra-articular injection of local anesthetics and steroids is performed to relieve pain
      originating from the SIJ.  Fluoroscopy has been used traditionally for image guidance for
      this procedure but there is a growing interest in use of ultrasound (US) for this procedure.
       US avoids radiation exposure to the patient and the health care team (HCT) and is less
      expensive.  We aim to compare procedural efficacy related outcomes for SIJ injections
      performed using these image-guided modalities.

      The study is a prospective, randomized trial. Patients with low back pain which is diagnosed
      secondary to SIJ disease will be identified beforehand in clinic and offered a therapeutic
      joint injection.  Informed consent will be obtained. Patients will be randomized for SIJ
      block with 3 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine and 40 mg depomedrol using
      guidance with ultrasound or fluoroscopy. In both groups, confirmation of needle placement
      will be obtained using contrast injection imaging before the injection is performed.  Record
      will be made of the number of times the needle is correctly placed into the articular space,
      as well as the number of attempts to do so. The final position of the  needle will be
      recorded.  Pain scores will be assessed before the procedure, as well as post-procedure at
      24 and 72 hours, as well as 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Patients will keep a pain diary
      and will be followed up at 3 months time in clinic.
