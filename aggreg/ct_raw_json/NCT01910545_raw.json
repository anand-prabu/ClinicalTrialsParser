OTS167 is a maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor which\n      demonstrated antitumor properties in laboratory tests.  It is being developed as an\n      anti-cancer drug.  In this first-in-human study OTS167 will be administered to patients with\n      solid tumors which have not responded to treatment."
