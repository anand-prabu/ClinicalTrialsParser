  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the data from pulse oximeters to capnographers as they are used to
      monitor patients who are being observed in the Emergency Department for a suspected overdose
      of alcohol or other drugs. The investigators will compare monitor data from patients who are
      and are not on supplemental oxygen, the ability of the monitors to predict the occurrence of
      airway interventions, and to detect ventilator changes noted on the opposing monitor. There
      will not be any interventions during this study other than the collection of data from the
      monitors and observation of the care of patients.
