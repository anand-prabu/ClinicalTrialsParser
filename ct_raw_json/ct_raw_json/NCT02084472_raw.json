To assess whether\n      accessible moisturizers can be used as alternatives in atopic eczema (AD), a randomized\n      controlled trial of patients with mild-to-moderate AD, aged 1-12 years was conducted. Two\n      separate sub-studies were conducted using a randomized controlled single (assessor) blind\n      trial design. Study 1 compared UEA vs. liquid paraffin (unscented baby oil) for baths, all\n      patients used HEB as moisturiser. In Study 2,  4 moisturisers were compared -HEB, CMG,\n      petroleum jelly and petroleum jelly/Glycerine (2:1). Assessments (SCORAD, POEM, NESS and\n      IQDOL) carried out at baseline, week 4, 8 and 12. Routine topical steroids and\n      antihistamines were continued as prescribed."
