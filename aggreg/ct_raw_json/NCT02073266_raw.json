The first patient was included in\n      January 2010 and the last in November 2011. The 12-month follow-up spread out from March\n      2011 to December 2012. The first group included 31 patients who had undergone macular hole\n      surgery using SF6 gas and who were advised to stay in face-down position for 7 days\n      postoperatively (SF6 group). These patients were compared to 28 patients who had undergone\n      macular hole surgery with C3F8 gas and who were advised to maintain a face-down position for\n      14 days.  Patients in both groups underwent vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling,\n      and fluid-gas exchange using either SF6 or C3F8.\n\n      Preoperative data included the characterization of the hole with Optical Coherence\n      Tomography (OCT), the best correct visual acuity (VA) recorded in number of letters using\n      the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, classification of the cataract\n      according to the LOCS III and the intraocular pressure IOP. Postoperative data included OCT\n      confirmation of the closure at 6 weeks and 1 year, 1 year's best corrected VA recorded in\n      number of letters (EDTRS chart) and determination of cataract development and extraction as\n      needed."
