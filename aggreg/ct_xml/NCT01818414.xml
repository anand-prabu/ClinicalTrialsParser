  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical preparation before second trimester dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) reduces risks and
      complications.  Osmotic cervical dilators as well as prostaglandin analogues have been
      studied for cervical preparation.  However, the optimal method for cervical preparation,
      especially for D&amp;E procedures that occur on the same day as cervical preparation, is not
      known.  This study will investigate misoprostol versus placebo as an adjunct to Dilapan-S
      for cervical preparation for same-day D&amp;E between 16+0 and 20+6 weeks gestation.

      HYPOTHESIS: Administration of 400 Âµg buccal misoprostol compared to placebo at least 3 hours
      prior to D&amp;E as an adjunct to cervical preparation with Dilapan-S will decrease operative
      time for same-day D&amp;E performed between 16+0 and 20+6 weeks.

    <description>The primary outcome will be operative time.  Operative time will be measured from initial passage of an instrument into the uterus to start the D&amp;E.  The end of operative time will be measured by the removal of the last instrument from the uterus to complete the D&amp;E.</description>
