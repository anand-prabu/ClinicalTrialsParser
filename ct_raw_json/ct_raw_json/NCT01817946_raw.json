            "textblock": "Myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the myotubularin\n      gene (MTM1).   The clinical spectrum is variable and ranges from individuals who require a\n      wheelchair and full time breathing support to those who are able to walk and breathe on\n      their own.  Symptoms of myotubular myopathy include long faces, facial weakness with eye\n      muscle weakness, breathing support with a muscle biopsy demonstrating central nucleated\n      fibers.  These symptoms may be caused by mutations or changes in the MTM1, BIN1 (bridging\n      integrator 1), DNM2 (dynamin 2) and RYR1 (ryanodine receptor 1) genes.  However,  the\n      majority are caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene.  Some patients with symptoms consistent\n      with myotubular myopathy who initially have negative testing of the MTM1 gene were later\n      found to have a unique type of change in the MTM1 gene.  This unique change, called a\n      deletion or duplication, can be found with a different type of genetic test called a CGH\n      (comparative genomic hybridization) array.\n\n      Investigators do not know how frequent deletions and duplications are in patients with\n      X-linked myotubular myopathy.  Recently, there have been advances in identifying potential\n      treatments for XLMTM.  The next step will be to proceed with clinical trials of potential\n      treatments.  In order to be ready for clinical trials, it is important that investigators\n      find the specific genetic change that is causing XLMTM in people with this diagnosis.  This\n      study will attempt to find changes in the MTM1 gene in individuals who have clinical\n      symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of XLMTM. Participants will be asked to enroll in the\n      CMDIR (Congenital Muscle Disease International Registry), complete a brief clinical survey,\n      provide access to medical records, and provide a saliva or blood sample for genetic testing.\n       Results of genetic testing will be communicated to participants by the physician specified\n      in the consent by the signing person.\n\n      Study Hypothesis:\n\n      Not all individuals with a clinical diagnosis of XLMTM have access to genetic testing.\n      Investigators know that deletions and duplications of the MTM1 gene can cause XLMTM.\n      Investigators will find more individuals with XLMTM by performing genetic testing of the\n      MTM1 gene, including CGH array for deletions and duplications."

However, if this method does not detect a\n           mutation or change in the MTM1 gene, a further test, called CGH Array, has to be\n           performed. For the CGH Array test, a saliva sample may deliver a clear result in terms\n           of a deletion/duplication mutation. In the event, CGH Array with the saliva sample does\n           not provide a result, a the blood sample is necessary to repeat CGH Array.\n\n        -  The study participant will receive a kit and instructions for saliva specimen\n           collection for genetic testing from the CMDIR in the mail.\n\n        -  If a mutation or change in the MTM1 gene could not be found by genetic testing and CGH\n           Array with a saliva sample, the study participant will receive a second kit in the mail\n           from the CMDIR with instructions for a blood draw to be used for CGH Array.\n\n        -  The family will coordinate collection of the saliva specimen or a local blood draw, if\n           necessary, and will be responsible for mailing the specimen in a pre-paid parcel to the\n           University of Chicago. There will be a $40 reimbursement for the cost of the blood\n           draw. Mailing the specimen to the testing site is at no cost for the participant.   A\n           two-week turn-around from receipt of the kit to sending it to the testing laboratory is\n           requested.\n\n        -  Genetic testing will start with standard sequencing of the MTM1 gene, isolated from the\n           saliva specimen, followed by CGH Array if sequencing of the MTM1 gene isolated from the\n           saliva sample or further from a blood sample if a variant consistent with the symptoms\n           could not be detected using the saliva sample.\n\n        -  Test results will be 1) reported to a physician specified by the study participant and\n           2) uploaded into the study participant's profile in the CMDIR and 3) if concurrently\n           enrolled in the Beggs Laboratory or other IRB-approved clinical study, test results\n           will also be made available to that study provided appropriate informed consent has\n           been given."
