Patients are randomized to one of two groups. The first\n      group receives cisplatin and fluorouracil every 4 weeks for 3 courses followed by\n      esophagectomy and regional lymphadenectomy. The second group undergoes esophagectomy and\n      regional lymphadenectomy alone. All patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be entered over 4 years."
