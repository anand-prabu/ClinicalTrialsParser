        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Shortness of breath as the most prominent presenting symptom

          -  Age greater ≥ 45

          -  Willingness, ability, and commitment to participate in the study

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Patients with any active implantable medical device

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Patients who have tattoos and or non-intact skin directly under the electrode
             position

          -  Patients who have had past allergic reactions to medical grade adhesives

          -  Patients that are dialysis dependent

          -  Patients who have had a lung lobectomy

          -  Patients in whom the shortness of breath presentation is due to obvious non HF cause
             such as acute chest trauma

          -  Patients who have received nitrates (sub-lingual, topical or IV), diuretics or
             vasopressors ≥ 1 hour prior to IMED-4 Recording

          -  Patients who decline to have their backs photographed with the IMED-4 device in
             position

          -  Patients who are receiving invasive or non-invasive positive airway pressure (PAP)
             ventilation prior to or following presentation to the ED (Self presentation or
             admission via EMS).

          -  Severe co-morbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate (i.e. other
             disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse, incarceration, shortened life
             expectancy, etc.)
