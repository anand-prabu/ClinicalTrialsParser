Just prior to the first application, and thereafter prior to the subsequent applications the TEWL was recorded using the portable closed chamber evaporimeter. The oil application was continued twice daily (every 12 hrs at the same time as the hour of birth e.g. 11 am and 11pm) till the completion of the seventh day (168 hrs of life).."

            "textblock": "The skin of newborn infants is immature and ineffective as a barrier. Preterm skin exhibits\n      even more vulnerability to the environment due to poor self regulatory heat mechanisms,\n      paucity of fatty tissue and its thinness. Most preterm babies lose up to 13% of their weight\n      as water loss from their skin during the first week of life. Many strategies have been\n      utilized by neonatologists to decrease this water loss. Edible coconut oil application on\n      the skin acts as a non permeable barrier and can help in achieving this. Hence the\n      investigators decided to undertake this study to objectively assess the  reduction in water\n      loss from skin after oil application."
