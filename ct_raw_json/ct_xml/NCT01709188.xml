  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine if the Musical Dual Task Training program
      improves attention control that influences measures of gait performances under dual tasking,
      balance, fear of falling, and behavioral disturbance in patients with mild to moderate
      dementia. This Musical Dual Task Training protocol is structured with musical content and
      patients are required to do musical tasks including singing and playing instruments
      contingent on visual or auditory cues while walking. This paradigm is designed to include
      music making because it involves great demands on attention and memory that might elicit
      experience-dependent plasticity in the brain. Musical Dual Task Training is proposed to
      strengthen brain networking for attention control that consequently may improve the gait
      performances in patients with dementia, as indicated by reducing dual task cost on gait.

    <description>Trail Making Test Part A requires the participants to draw lines to connect a set of 25 circles as fast as possible following the sequential order of numbers (1,2,3â€¦25) while still maintaining accuracy. Trail Making Test Part B is in a same format, but participants are required to alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The circles in Part B include both numbers (1 - 13) and letters (A - L). Results for both Part A and Part B are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
