  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether in Assisted Reproductive Technologies the
      use of culture medium supplemented with GM-CSF, a growth factor working on stem cells, may
      improve the embryo implantation in patients experiencing recurrent implantation failure in
      IVF cycles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Assisted Reproductive Technologies  the rate of pregnancy for cycle and the implantation
      rate remain low nevertheless the improvement in the last years. In particular there are a
      group of patients, in young reproductive age, experiencing recurrent implantation failure,
      nevertheless the good embryos produced and transferred. Recently, it has been showed that
      culture medium supplemented with GM-CSF, may improve the embryo outcomes in IVF. In this
      trial the investigators will test the potential benefits of this culture medium on embryos
      of patients experiencing recurrent implantation failure. 100 women with recurrent
      implantation failure, at least three failed previous IVF attempts with at least 8 good
      embryos transferred no more than 40 years old will be selected. These patients  will be
      assigned to two arms, one experimental and one other of control by a computer generated
      sequence. After the oocyte retrieval and fertilization by ICSI procedure, the fertilised
      oocyte (2PN)will cultured with the GM-CSF supplemented culture medium (EmbryoGen, Origio,
      Denmark), or in normal culture in micro drop of 30microliters under oil until the day of
      transfer (day three or 8 cells sage embryos). A maximum of three embryos will be
      transferred. The pregnancy rate the implantation rate will be the outcomes considered
