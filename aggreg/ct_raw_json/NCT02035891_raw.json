An experiment conducted by\n      Li et al. showed that twenty-four-hour urinary albumin excretion was reduced after 6 months\n      colchicine treatment in rats with diabetic nephropathy.As both micro and macrovascular\n      complications of diabetes are closely associated with inflammation,with the\n      anti-inflammation property,colchicine might reduce risk for micro and macrovascular\n      complications of diabetes.\n\n      STUDY DESIGN\u2014Patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria(30mg/g Cr\u2264UACR\u2264300mg/g Cr)\n      who have received stable dosage of ACEI/ARB for at least 3 months will be randomized to\n      receive colchicine 0.5 mg/day or placebo.\n\n      This trial includes four phases:\n\n        -  Phases 1: A prospective, randomized\uff0cdouble-blind\uff0cplacebo control study,aims at\n           evaluating changes of Urinary Albumin To Creatinine Ratio(UACR) from baseline to the\n           6th month.\n\n        -  Phases 2: A prospective, randomized\uff0cdouble-blind\uff0cplacebo control study,aims at\n           evaluating changes of CIMT from baseline to the 18th month.\n\n        -  Phases 3: A prospective, randomized\uff0csingle-blind\uff0ccontrol study,aims at evaluating\n           microvascular events from date of randomization until the third year.\n\n        -  Phases 4: A subsequent 3 years follow-up, aims at evaluating macrovascular and\n           microvascular events from date of randomization until the end of study.\n\n      SAFETY AND DATA MANAGEMENT-Independent Safety and Data Monitoring Committee has been set up\n      to monitor the safety and tolerability of the subjects; this committee will analyze data\n      independent of investigators at the end of any one phase.All of colchicine might be ceased\n      at the end of phase 3."
