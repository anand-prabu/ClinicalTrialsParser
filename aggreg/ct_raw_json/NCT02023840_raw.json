According to a cause-related concept, the disruption of\n      bacterial plaque biofilms can be defined as primary objective for the treatment of\n      periodontitis.\n\n      In the past few years, glycine powder air polishing showed positive outcomes  in removing\n      subgingival biofilm in periodontal pockets, and subgingivally delivered metronidazole seemed\n      to improve the results of scaling and root-planing alone . Recently, a new prophylactic\n      powder has been developed. The special action of the powder is attributable to the new\n      ingredient Erythritol and the extra-fine grains that measure only 14 microns. The small size\n      results on one hand in a minimal impact per grain on the treated surface and on the other\n      hand in a very dense jet of powder, efficient on biofilm.\n\n      Aim of the present study is evaluate the use of erythritol powder with/without the adjunct\n      of local metronidazole in the treatment of periodontal pockets.\n\n      MATERIALS & METHODS:\n\n      20 consecutive adult periodontal patients, requiring cause-related therapy as phase 1 of\n      their treatment plan, and presenting \u22654 sites with probing pocket depth \u22654mm will be\n      enrolled.
