IDA can have a\n      substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects and the treatment of\n      these subjects includes controlling the bleeding and replenishing lost iron. Oral iron\n      administration is often used in the clinical practice at many clinics; however, oral iron\n      may not be tolerated by all subjects. Hence, there is a need for an alternative iron\n      treatment in subjects, who do not tolerate oral iron.\n\n      This study is planned to compare the efficacy and safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 with\n      another parenteral iron preparation (iron sucrose) in subjects with IDA and who are\n      intolerant or unresponsive to oral iron therapy or who need iron rapidly."

Body weight < 50 kg\n\n          6. Rheumatoid arthritis with symptoms or signs of active inflammation\n\n          7. Pregnant or nursing women. In order to avoid pregnancy, women have to be surgically\n             sterile or use adequate contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices, hormonal\n             contraceptives, or double barrier method) during the whole study period and after the\n             study has ended for at least 5 times plasma biological half-life of the\n             investigational medicinal product\n\n          8.
