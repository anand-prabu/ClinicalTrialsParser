            "textblock": "INTRODUCTION\n\n      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a major cause of impairments in child population. Indeed, CP affects\n      two births per thousand (1). The brain damage is expressed by different neurological\n      impairments and functional disabilities. These disabilities justify intensive and sustained\n      multidisciplinary rehabilitation to reduce neurological impairments, to improve the\n      activities and participation of patients, and, ultimately, their quality of life (2, 3, 4).\n\n      Robotics interest has already been shown for lower limb rehabilitation (5). The development\n      of the upper limb rehabilitation robotic devices started later. To better stimulate brain\n      plasticity, these tools meet the actual recommendations existing in CP's rehabilitation (4).\n      Indeed, the robots allow the execution of a large number of movements whose quality is\n      controlled (6). A visual interface gives the patient a feedback of its movements (7), and\n      offers exercises oriented functional tasks that have meaning for him (8) and the possibly\n      dive into a virtual reality. All these elements justify the clinical development of robots\n      to assist the therapists.\n\n      In children with CP, several pilot studies have verified the clinical applicability of these\n      tools (9-11). However, no randomized controlled study has been performed to evaluate the\n      effectiveness of robotic-assisted therapy in children with CP (12). Moreover, no study\n      evaluated the effect of these therapies on the three areas of the ICF : Many studies focus\n      on impairments (e.g. muscle) without assessing the functional capacity of the patient: what\n      about their ability in every day life?\n\n      OBJECTIVES\n\n      To perform a prospective, randomized, controlled, single blind trial to assess the efficacy\n      of robotic-assisted therapy in children with cerebral palsy by evaluating the three fields\n      of the ICF.\n\n      METHODS\n\n      Twenty patients enrolled at the \"Institut Royal de l'Accueil du Handicap Moteur\" (IRAHM)\n      (1200 Brussels) will be included according to the following criteria: CP, whose location is\n      unilateral (hemiplegia) or bilateral (diplegia, quadriplegia), with a MACS (Manual Ability\n      Classification System) score > 1 (moderate to severe motor impairments) (13). The exclusion\n      criteria are the following: injection in the upper member of botulinum toxin within 6 months\n      or intrathecal baclofen used for the upper limb, an unstable clinical condition\n      contraindicating the upper limb rehabilitation treatments, cognitive disorders preventing\n      the understanding of the instructions or other neurological or orthopedic pathology\n      affecting the upper limb.\n\n      A randomisation of patients in two groups (control and experimental) will be performed,\n      using a stratified randomization method to ensure the equivalence of the two groups for age,\n      the location of the symptoms (diplegia, quadriplegia, left or right hemiplegia) and motor\n      neurological impairments (MACS score).\n\n      At IRAHM, each child benefits of 3 physiotherapy sessions and 2 occupational therapy\n      sessions per week. Each session lasts 45 minutes. The children in the control group will see\n      no change in their treatment. In the experimental group, 1 physiotherapy session and 1\n      occupational therapy session will be replaced by two sessions of intensive rehabilitation of\n      the arm with the robot. In total for each group, each child will benefit from 40 sessions of\n      45 minutes over 8 weeks therapy\n\n      Patients will be evaluated three times in the study: before the start of treatments, at the\n      end of treatments, and 3 months after the end of treatments.\n\n      Functional assessments will be carried out according to a protocol exploring the three\n      fields of the ICF. Impairments will be evaluated by the score of Quality of Upper Extremity\n      Skills Test (14), MACS (13), and the Box and Block test (15). Then, spasticity (with two\n      scales), kinematics and strength of the paretic arm will be evaluated using the modified\n      Ashworth and Tardieu scales, the ReaPLAN robot and a dynamometer, respectively (9, 16, 17).\n      Disability will be evaluated via Abilhand-kids (18) and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability\n      Inventory (19). Participation restrictions will be evaluated via the MHAVIE questionnaire\n      (20). All assessments will be carried out by a occupational therapist, which will be not\n      informed the group that the child is assigned (single-blind). All rehabilitation and\n      assessment sessions will be conducted at the IRAHM.\n\n      PERSPECTIVES\n\n      From this study, we hope to demonstrate the efficacy of robotic-assisted therapy in children\n      with cerebral palsy by evaluating the three fields of the ICF. These results could prove\n      that this tool can be a significant complement for the CP rehabilitation."
