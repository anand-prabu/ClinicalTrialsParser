Standard dosing of cefazolin 2 grams for\n      patients <120 kg and 3 grams for patients >120 kg is used as the dose for surgical\n      prophylaxis. This makes no provisions for weight based dosing. There has been some recent\n      data which states this might not be enough for the obese patients. The primary objective of\n      this study is to determine if weight based dosing (30 mg/kg) of cefazolin as surgical\n      prophylaxis for patients undergoing elective gastric bypass/laparoscopic Roux-en-y gastric\n      bypass provides appropriate serum concentrations for a larger percentage of time than the\n      current method of giving the standard 2 or 3 gram doses of cefazolin peri-operatively. The\n      concentration of cefazolin in tissue will also be measured to help assess this question."

Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin\n      commonly used for perioperative surgical prophylaxis in colorectal, abdominal, bariatric,\n      gynecologic and obstetric, or orthopedic total joint arthroplasty surgical procedures.\n      Previous cefazolin pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis in obese patients led to conflicting\n      results and recommendations. It is not clearly know to what extent the pharmacokinetics of\n      cefazolin in morbidly obese patients differ from those of non-obese patients.  Specific\n      dosing guidelines are then lacking.  The main objective of this study is to assess the\n      pharmacokinetics of cefazolin in morbidly obese after administrations of a standard\n      recommended 2-3 g dose or a weight-base 30-mg/kg dose"

For the purposes of this study, pharmacodynamic targets are defined as fT>MIC (time during which free drug concentrations exceed pathogen MICs) of 100% over periods of up to 4 hours in duration. The PK/PD probability of target attainment (PTA) for pharmacodynamic goals and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for both cefazolin regimens will be compared. A PTA of \u226590% and a CFR of \u2265 90% for a dosage regimen (i.e., predicted to meet pharmacodynamic targets in \u2265 90% of the total bacterial population across the full range of MICs) are considered optimum.",
