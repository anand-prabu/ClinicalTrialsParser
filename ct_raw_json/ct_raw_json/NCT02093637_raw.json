Additionally, we will collect data about patients' length of hospital\n      stay, which will allow for statistical control of the variable, complexity of surgical\n      procedure. The Research Assistants/Coordinators will be responsible for obtaining Informed\n      Consent and HIPAA Authorization from subjects, collecting data, and de-identifying  data\n      prior to review and analysis by the Investigators.
