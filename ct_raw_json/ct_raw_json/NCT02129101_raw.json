The hedgehog (Hh) signaling\n      pathway plays an important role in cellular growth, differentiation and repair.\n      Inappropriate activation of Hh pathway signaling and uncontrolled cellular proliferation may\n      be associated with mutations in the Hh-ligand cell surface receptor Smo. Erismodegib binds\n      to the Hh cell surface receptor Smo, which may result in the suppression of the Hh signaling\n      pathway and the inhibition of cancer cells. Azacitidine may stop the growth of cancer cells\n      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine together with\n      erismodegib may be a safe and successful treatment for patients with myeloid malignancies."
