Videx EC is a capsule form of the drug and may have fewer side\n      effects. Also, patients would not have to take as many pills since patients taking Videx EC\n      would have to take only 1 capsule per day instead of 2 tablets per day. This study will see\n      if patients taking Videx EC have fewer side effects."

            "textblock": "Despite its therapeutic advantages and proven efficacy in the treatment of HIV-infected\n      patients, didanosine may continue to be underutilized because many patients experience\n      undesirable gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and palatability problems. Once-daily dosing\n      with Videx EC is expected to improve patient adherence with possible improved palatability\n      and remove the GI side effects associated with the buffers included in the tablet. Videx EC\n      once-daily dosing would improve pill burden by decreasing from 2 tablets to 1 capsule per\n      day. Therefore, Videx EC may represent a significant step toward achieving better patient\n      satisfaction, improved regimen adherence, and optimal virologic outcomes with\n      Videx-containing regimens.\n\n      Patients are randomized to either continue their current Videx tablet-containing regimen for\n      an additional 2 weeks or replace their Videx tablets with Videx EC. Patients who remain on\n      Videx tablets are switched to the EC formulation at Study Week 2 for the remaining 4 weeks\n      of the study period. For patients who continue and successfully complete the Week 6 study\n      visit, an optional extended dosing period is offered until Videx EC becomes commercially\n      available or the study funder terminates the study. Blood specimens for safety evaluations\n      and viral load are collected at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6.  For patients participating in the\n      extended dosing period, the visit schedule is every 8 weeks. Symptom scores between the 2\n      treatment groups are compared, with the primary comparison occurring at the Week 2 visit.\n      Analyses include changes in GSRS scores administered by clinician interview at each study\n      visit. Assessment of GI symptoms, palatability features, dosing convenience, lifestyle\n      effects, and Videx preference is evaluated by the patient. Adverse events are assessed\n      objectively by the observations of both the investigator and the patient."
