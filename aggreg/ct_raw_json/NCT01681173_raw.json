Our primary objective is to\n      compare a life style diabetes prevention program(PRAEDIAS) with and without added insoluble\n      fibers in its effectiveness to prevent incident diabetes type 2 in high risk individuals\n      with impaired glucose tolerance. Subjects with IGT not willing to participate in the\n      intervention will be used as independent controls. Secondary aims are to identify mechanisms\n      of action with regard to body composition, anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects of\n      fibers. We propose a randomized, prospective intervention study. The results will be of\n      general relevance for guidance of fiber intake in the population and will help the food\n      industry to design healthy high fiber foods. Fiber can be added at low cost to numerous\n      foods. Increased fiber intake may therefore provide a simple non-cognitive prevention\n      strategy effective at the population level."

Large prospective cohort studies clearly show that mainly\n      insoluble cereal fiber from whole grains is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes\n      and cardiovascular disease. However, there is a lack of evidence from prospective\n      intervention studies targeted to evaluate the potential of dietary fibers to reduce diabetes\n      and cardiovascular disease as recently stated by the Cochrane Foundation. Dietary fiber\n      intake is generally much lower than currently recommended, which may in part be related to\n      side effects of whole grain nutrients and their gustatory properties. Intestinally\n      uncomfortable effects are at least partly related to fermentation which is much less induced\n      by insoluble non-fermentable fibers than by soluble fermentable fibers. The prospective\n      demonstration of beneficial effects of insoluble fibers in preventing diabetes type 2 will\n      allow detailed nutritional recommendations. This may serve to support the consumption of\n      metabolically beneficial constituents of fiber-rich diets and help to increase fiber intake\n      by high fiber natural nutrients or everyday nutrients enriched in insoluble natural fibers."
