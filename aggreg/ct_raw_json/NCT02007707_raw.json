The study is a\n      two-arm randomized controlled trial targeting a total of 18 lay health workers (LHW) and 108\n      dyads of a smoker and a family member from the same household.  The hypotheses are:\n\n      H. At 6-month post initiation of the intervention, Vietnamese male daily smokers who receive\n      the proposed \u2015Quit Smoking For a Healthy Family Intervention, a Family-based Intervention\n      (FI), will be more likely to achieve biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence of\n      smoking abstinence when compared to those receiving an attention control intervention (CI).\n\n      H2. At 6-month, FI participants we be more likely to report making at least one 24-hour quit\n      attempt than those in CI.\n\n      H3. At 6-month, FI participants will be more likely to report using a recommended\n      evidence-based smoking cessation resource (quitline, FDA-approved smoking cessation\n      medications, advice from health professionals) than those in CI"
