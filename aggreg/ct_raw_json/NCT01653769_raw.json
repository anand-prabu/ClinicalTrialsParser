Surgical bleeding is associated with\n      significant morbidity.\n\n      One way to prevent bleeding is to use a special glue (sealant) after performing large\n      connections on the aorta. The goal of this study is to compare the different methods\n      surgeons use to stop/prevent bleeding.\n\n      The study team will collect medical information about patients before, during, and after\n      surgery on their aortas, including the methods used to prevent bleeding. This information\n      may help doctors improve the way that they care for these patients."

            "textblock": "Bleeding is a major complication of cardiac surgery, and a significant cause of morbidity\n      and mortality [1-4].  Hemostasis can be challenging during complex cardiac surgery,\n      particularly due to friability of the  tissue, coagulopathy, poor visualization of the\n      surgical field, and limited accessibility to bleeding sites [5].  Failure to achieve and\n      maintain hemostasis and reinforce fragile tissue may result in additional bleeding, which\n      can further reduce visualization, increase operative blood loss, lengthen surgery, increase\n      the use of blood products, and contribute to postoperative complications and reoperation\n      [1-4].\n\n      Postoperative bleeding is a significant concern in cardio-thoracic surgery. Bleeding, either\n      intraoperative or postoperative, has been associated with extended in-hospital length of\n      stay, reoperations, severe morbidity and death [12].  In addition to surgical technique, a\n      variety of therapeutic agents are available to assist in hemostasis. Surgical sealants are\n      used to prevent suture line bleeding when ligation or conventional methods are ineffective\n      or impractical [13].  CoSeal\u00ae Surgical Sealant (CoSeal\u00ae, Baxter, Westlake Village, CA) is a\n      synthetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer [11, 13].  The polymers cross-link with proteins\n      in the tissue and begin to gel in approximately 5 seconds and set within 60 seconds, forming\n      a strong, flexible, clear, degradable hydrogel that adheres to both tissue and synthetic\n      graft surfaces [11, 13-14].  A secure seal is maintained through covalent tissue bonds even\n      under high pressures in vessels, such as the aorta [15].  The gel is completely resorbed\n      within 30 days [14]."
