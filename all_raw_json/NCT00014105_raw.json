Determine the acute and long-term toxic\n      effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this\n      regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the potential of either a pharmacokinetic- or\n      pharmacodynamic-mediated drug interaction in patients treated with this regimen. V.\n      Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with the established MTD of this\n      regimen. VI. Determine time to tumor progression and survival in patients treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to prior\n      nitrosourea-based chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes\n      on day 1 and oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a\n      maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with a persistent response may continue to receive temozolomide only for an\n      additional 6 courses. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and\n      temozolomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n      Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive carboplatin and\n      temozolomide at the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-70 patients (3-30 for phase I and 10-40 for phase II) will\n      be accrued for this study."
