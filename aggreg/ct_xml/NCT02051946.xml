      The purpose of this study is to identify whether or not injection of a study drug
      (ethacrynic acid) using the investigational Retroject device is able to lower eye pressures
      in patients with advanced glaucoma.  20 patients with advanced glaucoma with visual acuity
      less than 20/200 and intraocular pressures (IOP)  &gt;20mmHg on maximum medical therapy will be
      asked to participate in the study. The first five patients will have the Retroject device
      placed over their eye for 30 seconds and then removed. Assuming no issues, then it will be
      placed on the eye for one minute. The second group of patients (3 total) will have the
      Retroject device placed on the eye and then an injection of ethacrynic acid into the
      episcleral vein. The third group of patients (12 total) will have the Retroject device
      placed on the eye and then will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either an ethacrynic
      acid injection or a balanced salt solution injection. All 20 patients will then return for
      intraocular pressure measurements on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 as well as 6 weeks after injection.
      In addition, the patients will undergo pre and post intervention corneal endothelial
      assessments (endothelial cell count, shape analysis, and pachymetry). Potential safety
      issues are unlikely and include bleeding, infection, pain, ototoxicity, or temporary or
      permanent loss of vision.

    <description>If the patient agrees to participate in this study, the patient will be asked to lie in a supine position. Then a drop of proparacaine as well as a drop of betadine will be placed in the eye.  The sterile, disposable Retroject Device will be pushed down over the eye. It will feel tight around the patient's eye for about a minute. The Retroject device will then be removed without injection of ethacrynic acid</description>
