            "textblock": "Adherence to complex medication regimens is critical to successful treatment of HIV\n      infection.  Unfortunately, adherence to medical regimens with conventional interventions\n      averages 50% in chronic disease. We have observed that adherence barriers that were\n      unrecognized by providers in the clinic setting have been detected during home visits.  It\n      is possible that recognition and interventions to resolve adherence barriers observed during\n      home visits may improve adherence.  This proposal will test the hypothesis that home-visits\n      which identify previously unrecognized adherence barriers and provide support and education\n      will increase medication adherence among children and youth with HIV infection and improve\n      the patient/health care provider relationship.  Specific aims of the study are: 1.\tDetermine\n      the impact of a series of home-visits on adherence to medication regimens for HIV infected\n      youth and children. 1a.  Adherence to medical regimens will be assessed before and after the\n      series of home-visits using a self-report questionnaire and Microelectronic Monitoring\n      System (MEMS) or in-home pill count. 1b. For each of these measures a percentage of\n      adherence will be calculated and compared from a baseline to after the final home visit and\n      after the six month follow up period. 2.\tAssess the changes in patient satisfaction from\n      baseline to after the home-visits using a questionnaire completed by the patient/family. 3.\n      Incorporate a pilot study to assess the changes in the provider's knowledge of the patient's\n      family characteristics and home circumstances relevant to adherence following the home\n      visits."
