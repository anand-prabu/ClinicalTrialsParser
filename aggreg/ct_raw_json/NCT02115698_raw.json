They will be recruited as a subgroup to protocol ID: H-4-2013-070.\n\n      Upon inclusion, each individual will be randomized into one of the five groups stratified\n      according to gender (M/F) and 30s chair stand (<16/16 or above). The five groups are: Heavy\n      Resistance Training (N=12), Light Intensity Training (N=12), Protein Whey (N=16), Protein\n      Collagen (N=16) and Carbohydrate (N=12). The individuals randomized into one of the\n      supplementation groups (Protein Whey, Protein Collagen or Carbohydrate) will be blinded to\n      the supplement content.\n\n      Assessments will be performed at Baseline (before intervention start), and after 3, 6 and 12\n      months of intervention.\n\n      The primary outcome is change in basal muscle protein synthesis measured as the fractional\n      synthesis rates of relevant muscle proteins from Baseline to 12 months of intervention.\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that by applying the intension-to-treat analysis, the Light\n      Intensity Training group will increase quadriceps muscle cross sectional area just as much\n      as the Heavy Resistance Training group. The two training groups will gain more muscle mass\n      than the Protein Whey group, which will gain more than the Protein Collagen and the\n      Carbohydrate groups that will loose the quadriceps muscle cross sectional areas. These\n      hypothesized changes might be reflected in the basal protein turnover measurements."
