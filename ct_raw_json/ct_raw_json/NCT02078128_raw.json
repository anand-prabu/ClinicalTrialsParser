Modern has been reported in the literature\n      that \u03b2-glucan can enhance the immune system of animals, and to enhance the function of the\n      animal against bacterial, fungal and viral infections, and cancer.In this study, the use of\n      \u03b2-glucan to enhance the biological characteristics of the non-specific immunity, to explore\n      the impact of postoperative patients with wound healing and infection rates.The observation\n      of the healing process to take the Leather District wounds (5 ~ 200 cm2). The experiments\n      were carried out for 18 months, were observed record the following three: (1) the rate of\n      wound healing, (2) The rate of infection assessment: record length of time and the point in\n      time at all levels of antibiotic use also observe the wound change (redness, swelling, heat,\n      pain).(3) days of hospitalization, and spend statistics. Using unpaired student's t-test\n      analysis, group data whether the differences between groups of experimental data. represents\n      a statistically significant when p <0.05."
