Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. It is not yet known if chlorambucil is more effective than radiation therapy in\n      treating follicular lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chlorambucil with that\n      of radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV follicular lymphoma\n      that has not been previously treated."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral chlorambucil on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks\n           for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy on days 1 and 3 (and days 15 and 17 for split\n           course).\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 3, 6, and 8 (arm I), and then at\n      4-6 weeks after study.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, 3-4 months (arm I), 3 months and 6 months (arm II), 11,\n      12, 15, 18, and 21 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 444 patients (222 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 4 years."
