We also propose that maintaining bone\n      mass will decrease fracture rates, as well as pain and the rate of progression of scoliosis.\n\n      Rigorous care to ensure adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, as well as addition of a\n      weekly bisphosphonate, are the central aspect of the project. In addition, we will monitor\n      to avoid possible side-effects such as hypercalciuria and kidney stones."
