Patients will be randomized\n      to the use of the Alexis retractor during Cesarean section (treatment group) or the use of\n      traditional hand-held retractors (control group). We will determine if there is any\n      difference in surgical site infection or wound disruption rates.  We will also determine if\n      there is a difference in the duration of surgery or length of time from skin incision to\n      delivery of the infant, change in hemoglobin, estimated blood loss, and postoperative length\n      of stay, intra-operative or postoperative anti-emetic requirements, need for hospital\n      readmission or emergency room visits, or other complication rate between the two groups."
