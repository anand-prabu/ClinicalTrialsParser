Drugs used in chemotherapy use\n      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet\n      known whether the interleukin-2 gene is more effective than methotrexate for advanced head\n      and neck cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of the interleukin-2 gene\n      with that of methotrexate in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory stage III or\n      stage IV head and neck cancer."

II. Determine the\n      safety and tolerability of interleukin-2 gene in these patients. III. Compare the quality of\n      life of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 gene intratumorally on days 1 and 4 of\n      week 1, and then once weekly for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive methotrexate IV once weekly. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is\n      assessed at the beginning of the study and at weeks 5, 13, 17 and 25. Patients are followed\n      every 2-3 weeks for up to 18 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
