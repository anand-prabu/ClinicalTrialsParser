  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important that pregnant women eat an adequate amount of protein to ensure healthy
      growth and development of the fetus. Amino acids are the building blocks of the body's
      protein. Glycine is an amino acid that can be made in the body, but under certain metabolic
      circumstances (e.g. pregnancy) the body's needs may be higher and thus glycine must be
      obtained from the diet. Currently, it is not known how much glycine may be needed from the
      diet during pregnancy. We plan to study dietary glycine requirements in healthy pregnant
      women, during early and late gestation. We will do this using a modern, safe and quick
      method.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the dietary glycine requirement in healthy pregnant
      women during mid (20 - 30 weeks) and late (31 - 40 weeks) gestation.

      The investigators hypothesize that there is a dietary requirement for glycine during
      pregnancy due to an increased metabolic demand. With increased glycine intake the
      investigators hypothesize to observe an increase in protein synthesis, as measured by the
      indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method.
