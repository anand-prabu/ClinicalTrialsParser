The amino\n      acids the investigators are studying are called branched chain amino acids. The\n      investigators will look at the levels (amount) of branched chain amino acids in blood before\n      and after consumption of specially prepared meals. The investigators hypothesize that\n      circulating branch chain amino acid (BCAA) levels will be lower following a low BCAA-content\n      diet compared with a high BCAA-content diet."
