            "textblock": "Regional anaesthesia has become the cornerstone of multimodal analgesia. With the advent of\n      ultrasound guided nerve blocks regional anaesthesia has achieved both greater efficacy and a\n      better safety profile as the injection of local anaesthetic is performed under direct\n      vision. This has allowed a reduction of the amount of local anaesthetic injected as compared\n      to peripheral nerve stimulation technique . Blockade of sciatic nerve combined with\n      saphenous nerve provides anaesthesia and analgesia for ankle/foot surgeries. Various\n      combinations of local anaesthetics have been used to provide optimal blockade   . A mixture\n      of lidocaine with a long acting local anaesthetic is commonly used. This provides a rapid\n      onset of blockade, but of a consistently shorter duration compared to a long acting local\n      anaesthetic alone. We hypothesize that sequential perineural injection of lidocaine and\n      bupivacaine provides similar onset but a longer duration of sensory block compared to the\n      same dose and volume of local anaesthetic mixed in advance."
