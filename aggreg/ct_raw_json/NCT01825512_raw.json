            "textblock": "Haemoglobinopathies are a group of inherited disorders characterized by structural\n      variations of the haemoglobin molecule. Most of the patients affected require for survival\n      chronic red blood cells transfusions to overcome ineffective erythropoiesis.  Unfortunately,\n      all chronically transfused patients become clinically iron overloaded as there is no\n      physiological mechanism for the removal of iron from the body.  The pathologic changes and\n      clinical manifestations associated  to chronic iron overload are common among all\n      transfusional iron-overload patients, albeit best documented in patients with\n      beta-thalassemia major.  The recommended treatment consists in regular blood transfusions\n      combined with chelating therapy to remove the harmful iron accumulation in the body.\n\n      Currently, in the clinical practice particularly in children and adolescents, the criteria\n      leading to the choice of the chelating agent include also the adherence to therapy, thus\n      favouring the use of oral chelators (Ceci A et al., 2011) DFP (Deferiprone) was the first\n      oral chelator authorised in Europe in 1999 as second line treatment for the treatment of\n      iron overload in patients with thalassaemia major when DFO (Deferoxamine) is contraindicated\n      or inadequate.  However, despite a wide experience of DFP with iron overloaded (specifically\n      thalassaemic )patients, limited data are available for younger children. For this reason the\n      need for additional data in younger children is expressively included in the 2009 PDCO\n      (Paediatric Committee) Priority List.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the non-inferiority of DFP compared to DFX\n      (deferasirox)in paediatric patients affected by hereditary haemoglobinopathies requiring\n      chronic transfusions and chelation. Non inferiority will be established in terms of\n      percentage of patients successfully chelated, as assessed by serum ferritin levels (in all\n      patients) and cardiac MRI T2* (in patients above 10 years of age able to have an MRI scan\n      without sedation)."
