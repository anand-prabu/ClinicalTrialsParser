  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to compare point-of-care focused cardiac ultrasound
      (FOCUS) to thoracic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in the measurement of ascending
      aortic dimensions. We hypothesize that FOCUS will demonstrate good agreement with CTA in the
      measurement of ascending aortic dimensions and accurately detect dilation and aneursymal
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonspecific chest pain is frequently encountered in the emergency department. Accounting for
      over 13,000 deaths annually, aortic aneurysmal disease is a potential cause of chest
      pain.There are multiple diagnostic imaging modalities in practice to interrogate the
      thoracic aorta, with the most common being computed tomographic angiography (CTA),
      trans-thoracic echochardiography (TTE) and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE),  each
      with its own advantages and limitations. In the ED setting, point-of-care (POC) focused
      cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) is increasingly being used as an adjunct to the emergency
      physician's (EP) workup of undifferentiated chest pain.  Based on prior retrospective data
      FOCUS and CTA appear to have good agreement. This studies aims to confirm these findings
      through prospective evaluation

      Specific Aims

      Aim 1:  To prospectively compare Point of Care (POC) Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FOCUS) to
      thoracic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in the measurement of ascending aortic
      dimensions.

      Maximal diameter measurements of the ascending thoracic aorta by FOCUS will be compared to
      CTA.  Bland Altman plots with 95% limits of agreement will be used to determine clinical and
      statistical significance.

      Hypothesis:  95% limits of agreement between FOCUS and CTA will be within +/- 5 mm.

      Aim 2:  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Point-of-Care Focused Cardiac Ultrasound for
      the detection of thoracic aortic dilation and aneurysm with computed tomographic angiography
      as the reference standard

      Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy of FOCUS will be computed with CTA as the reference
      standard.
