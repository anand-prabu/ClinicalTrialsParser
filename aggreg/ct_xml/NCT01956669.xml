  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, pazopanib has on
      children, adolescents and young adults between 12 months and less than or equal to 18 years
      of age with relapsed or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma, non rhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue
      sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma (measurable
      and/or evaluable), or hepatoblastoma. This is a two-stage open label phase II trial of
      pazopanib in children, adolescents and young adults with recurrent or refractory solid
      tumors. Eligible patients will receive pazopanib daily as an oral tablet (450 mg/m2/dose) or
      as a powder for suspension (160 mg/m2/dose) in 28 day cycles. The maximum dose to be
      administered daily is 800 mg. Patients will be closely monitored with clinical and
      laboratory observations for side effects. Response to treatment will be evaluated using
      appropriate imaging studies. In the absence of unacceptable side effects or progressive
      disease, patients may continue receiving pazopanib for up to 2 years.
