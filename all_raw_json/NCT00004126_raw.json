Assess the\n      overall survival, time to tumor progression, and toxicities associated with this combination\n      regimen in this patient population. III. Assess the neurologic toxicity of this combination\n      regimen and its correlation with creatinine clearance in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by\n      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 2 years or\n      until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 24\n      months."
