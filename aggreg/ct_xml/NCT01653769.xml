  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery on the aorta can be associated with significant blood loss. Most commonly this is
      due to bleeding at the site of aortic anastomosis. Surgical bleeding is associated with
      significant morbidity.

      One way to prevent bleeding is to use a special glue (sealant) after performing large
      connections on the aorta. The goal of this study is to compare the different methods
      surgeons use to stop/prevent bleeding.

      The study team will collect medical information about patients before, during, and after
      surgery on their aortas, including the methods used to prevent bleeding. This information
      may help doctors improve the way that they care for these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding is a major complication of cardiac surgery, and a significant cause of morbidity
      and mortality [1-4].  Hemostasis can be challenging during complex cardiac surgery,
      particularly due to friability of the  tissue, coagulopathy, poor visualization of the
      surgical field, and limited accessibility to bleeding sites [5].  Failure to achieve and
      maintain hemostasis and reinforce fragile tissue may result in additional bleeding, which
      can further reduce visualization, increase operative blood loss, lengthen surgery, increase
      the use of blood products, and contribute to postoperative complications and reoperation
      [1-4].

      Postoperative bleeding is a significant concern in cardio-thoracic surgery. Bleeding, either
      intraoperative or postoperative, has been associated with extended in-hospital length of
      stay, reoperations, severe morbidity and death [12].  In addition to surgical technique, a
      variety of therapeutic agents are available to assist in hemostasis. Surgical sealants are
      used to prevent suture line bleeding when ligation or conventional methods are ineffective
      or impractical [13].  CoSeal® Surgical Sealant (CoSeal®, Baxter, Westlake Village, CA) is a
      synthetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer [11, 13].  The polymers cross-link with proteins
      in the tissue and begin to gel in approximately 5 seconds and set within 60 seconds, forming
      a strong, flexible, clear, degradable hydrogel that adheres to both tissue and synthetic
      graft surfaces [11, 13-14].  A secure seal is maintained through covalent tissue bonds even
      under high pressures in vessels, such as the aorta [15].  The gel is completely resorbed
      within 30 days [14].

        Subjects for this study will be selected from patients undergoing cardio-thoracic surgery
        requiring a large aortic anastomosis.  Both the retrospective and prospective study
        components will review the data of all procedures requiring a large aortic anastomosis in
        order to compare those in which CoSeal® was used versus other materials/techniques.

        For the retrospective arm of the study, pre-existing data will be collected from the
        patient's medical records under a HIPAA Waiver of Authorization.  For the prospective arm
        of the study, patients will provide consent to collect their data.

        Approximately 150 patients will be enrolled in this study. Specifically, consecutive
        potential subjects will be evaluated for participation in this study according to the
        inclusion and exclusion criteria.
