Treating a person's T cells in the laboratory and then reinfusing\n      them may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of T-cell therapy in treating patients who\n      have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy."

PBMC\n      are activated and expanded ex vivo by costimulation with antihuman CD3 and antihuman CD28\n      monoclonal antibodies covalently attached to superparamagnetic microbeads (Xcellerate).\n      Xcellerate-activated T cells are reinfused on day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks and then monthly for 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study."
