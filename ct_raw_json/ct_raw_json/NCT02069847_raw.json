            "textblock": "Surgery has been historically the mainstay treatment for advanced pre-malignant lesions and\n      early esophageal cancers. However, esophagectomy is associated with significant morbidity\n      and mortality. With the advance of therapeutic endoscopy, there has been a growing interest\n      and application of endoscopic resection and mucosal ablative techniques for the treatment of\n      these diseases. Esophageal stricture (ES) formation has become an increasingly recognized\n      complication of extensive endoscopic mucosal ablation and/or resection. The resultant\n      symptomatic stricture development can significantly impair a patient's quality of life.\n      Endoscopic therapy of esophageal strictures with balloon dilation and/or local steroid\n      injection is invasive, costly, and associated with the potential risk of perforation.\n      Recently, oral corticosteroids have been introduced for the prevention of esophageal\n      stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection.\n\n      Budesonide is a synthetic steroid with topical anti-inflammatory properties and high\n      first-pass metabolism; thus, potentially less systemic absorption and side effects.\n\n      Hypothesis: Oral budesonide prevents esophageal stricture formation in patients who\n      underwent radical endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection\n      (ESD) for advanced premalignant esophageal lesions or superficial esophageal cancers."

            "textblock": "Esophageal stricture (ES) formation is a widely recognized adverse event of radical EMR and\n      ESD. Indeed, ES is the most common complication of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for\n      Barrett's esophagus (BE), with a reported incidence ranging from 5% to 12%. A single-center\n      retrospective study reported ES formation in 67% of 73 patients with EMR of at least 50% of\n      their esophageal circumference. Similarly, the incidence of ES development after ESD is\n      between 70-90% when the mucosal defect involves more than three-quarters of the esophageal\n      circumference. In aggregate, the extent of the esophageal mucosal defect following\n      endotherapy appears to be the most consistent predictor of ES formation. Prevention of ES\n      development following endotherapy can significantly improve a patient's quality of life and\n      possibly reduce the potential risks and costs associated with treatment of ES with repeated\n      endoscopic balloon dilations (EBD). Glucocorticoids have been evaluated as a potential\n      preventive therapy for ES based on their anti-inflammatory properties and inhibitory effects\n      on collagen deposition. Oral prednisolone has been shown to be effective as a preventive\n      strategy for ES formation. However, prolonged use of systemic oral steroids can be\n      associated with multiple adverse effects.\n\n      Budesonide is a synthetic steroid with topical anti-inflammatory properties and high\n      first-pass metabolism; thus, potentially less systemic absorption and side effects. Most\n      recently Mayo Clinic Rochester developed a new budesonide capsule formulation. Alike viscous\n      budesonide the budesonide capsule can be opened and the powder can be mixed with honey or\n      pancake syrup. A similar formulation is currently used in pilot studies for treatment of\n      eosinophilic esophagitis. The advantage of budesonide capsule is the improve taste in\n      comparison to viscous budesonide originating from budesonide respules which is unpalatable.\n\n      Study aims:\n\n        1. The aim of this study is to prospectively record our experience with budesonide for the\n           prevention of esophageal stricture formation after endotherapy (mucosal resection,\n           submucosal dissection) as part of routine medical care.\n\n        2. The data will be compared with outcomes with well-annotated historical controls that\n           underwent similar procedure with similar follow up but without budesonide exposure.\n\n        3. If sufficient efficacy is seen, these data will be used to plan a prospective\n           controlled clinical trial. All patients in the study group will receive standard\n           medical care and no experimental interventions will be performed."
