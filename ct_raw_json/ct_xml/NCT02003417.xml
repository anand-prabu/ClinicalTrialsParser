  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the proportion of prostate cancer patients receiving external beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with controlled blood sugars
      (fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c), blood pressure, and cholesterol profile (total
      cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months after completing
      radiation treatment. In addition, receipt of guideline-recommended cardiovascular, primary
      and preventive care as well as patient-reported quality of life and satisfaction with care
      among these patients will be evaluated at baseline and 12 months.
