  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich's ataxia is characterized by progressive alterations in the function of the
      cerebellum accompanied by an atrophy of the spinal cord. Although the genetic defect
      responsible for the disease has been identified more than 15 years ago, objective markers of
      the pathologic process (i.e., biomarkers) that would allow measuring the effects of
      potential therapies are still lacking. Moreover, it is still unclear how the malfunction of
      the cerebellum affects the rest of the brain, and understanding the connectivity and
      neurochemistry of the central nervous system might yield new insights in the understanding
      of the disease, in addition to providing potential markers.

      To address these needs, the investigators aim at utilizing the capabilities of Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS). Using techniques called Diffusion Imaging,
      resting-state functional MRI, and Proton Spectroscopy (1H MRS), the investigators propose to
      determine the differences in the connectivity and neurochemistry of the spinal cord and the
      brain between patients affected by Friedreich's ataxia and healthy controls. The
      investigators plan on imaging both patients and controls at a 3T magnet, a system that
      although not yet available in all medical facilities, is becoming standard in most hospitals
      and clinics. In addition, the investigators plan on scanning the brain of the volunteers at
      7T, an ultra-high field system that benefits from higher resolution, yielding images with
      greater anatomical and functional details. Moreover, the investigators expect that the
      findings from 7T will benefit the methodology employed at 3T.

    <description>The investigators will look at the differences between patients and controls. This is observational, not interventional.
The fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar value. The apparent coefficient of diffusion, radial and axial diffusivity are measured in mm2/s. The metabolite concentrations in the brain are in the order of Âµg/ g wet tissue weight. Cortical thickness is measured in mm.</description>
