      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate safety and tolerability of 8-week oral administration of SAR100842 in patients
      with diffuse, cutaneous systemic sclerosis.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of SAR100842 in patients with systemic sclerosis
           as measured by disease related biomarkers and Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor
           signaling markers in blood and skin

        -  To explore the effect of SAR100842 on skin thickness in patients with systemic
           sclerosis as measured by the Modified Rodnan Skin score (mRSS)

        -  To explore the effect of SAR100842 on quality of life as measured by the Scleroderma
           Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

        - Patients who meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for systemic
        sclerosis with diffuse cutaneous involvement and &lt;36 months since the onset of the first
        systemic sclerosis manifestation other than Raynaud's phenomenon and have a Modified
        Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) ≥ 15 and an area of definite involvement of the dorsal forearm
        that is considered amenable to repeated 4mm skin biopsies.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with high dose or unstable low dose  immunosuppressive drugs, cytotoxic,
             anti-fibrotic or glucocorticoids drugs at least 4 weeks prior to screening

          2. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL

          3. Gastrointestinal involvement preventing oral administration of study drug

          4. Severe cardiac and/or pulmonary disease

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
