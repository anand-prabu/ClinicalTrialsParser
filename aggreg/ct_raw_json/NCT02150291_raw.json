The hematological adverse effects lead\n      to a trade-off between continuing the treatment with optimal dosage, to clear the virus,\n      exacerbating thereby the side effects versus decreasing dosage to relieve severe anemia,\n      reducing thereby the chances of achieving sustained virological response (SVR).  Therefore,\n      we aimed at giving Folic acid\u00ae and Neurobion\u00ae to HCV-infected patients during treatment with\n      different types of PEG-IFN plus ribavirin in an attempt to evaluate its efficacy and safety\n      as a prophylactic treatment to prevent hematological adverse effects. Preventing adverse\n      effects without interfering with the therapeutic efficacy of different types of PEG-IFN plus\n      ribavirin in HCV patients will lead to better health outcomes and improvement in their\n      quality of life (HRQOL)."
