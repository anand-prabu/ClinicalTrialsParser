Injection of cold trastuzumab will be mixed with 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab so that total mass is equal to 50 mg [1]. In the first ten patients we wish to obtain normal organ dosimetry, pharmacokinetics & determine optimal imaging time, therefore these patients will undergo imaging at 4 time points post injection, whole body counts & blood draws. Subsequent patients will receive the antibody & will only undergo imaging at a single time point (based on the first 10 patients) & will not have whole body counts or serial bloods for pharmacokinetics. The administration of 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab to patients undergoing a second study will be identical as for their baseline study. Patients undergoing a second injection will only have one scan that will be performed within 1 day before or 2 days after their optimum imaging time point, determined from their baseline imaging study."
