  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to study the cognitive functions in patients with chronic obstructive lung
      disease (COLD) and patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) compared to healthy
      controls. The cognitive functions are tested with and without oxygen therapy to clarify the
      effect of oxygen therapy. Driving simulations is used to test the cognitive functions.

      The hypothesis is that patients with chronic lung disease have decreased cognitive functions
      and that oxygen therapy will increase their cognitive functions.
