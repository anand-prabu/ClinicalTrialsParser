Determine the duration of remission in these\n      patients. III. Determine the toxicity of the octreotide regimen in this population. IV.\n      Determine the response rate, duration of remission, survival and toxicity of prednisone\n      added to octreotide in patients with stable disease following octreotide alone.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive octreotide subcutaneously three times daily for 1 month. After\n      two courses of treatment, patients are assessed for response. Patients experiencing partial\n      or complete response continue octreotide for a maximum of 1 year (12 courses) in the absence\n      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with stable disease after 2\n      courses of octreotide receive daily oral prednisone in addition to octreotide for an\n      additional 2 courses. These patients are then reevaluated and continue on octreotide plus\n      prednisone for a maximum of 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for the second\n      year, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 38 patients accrued into this study over approximately 2\n      years."
