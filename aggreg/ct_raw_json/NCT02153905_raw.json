            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with\n      cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the\n      laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus\n      (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient.\n      This type of therapy is called gene transfer.   In this protocol, we are modifying the\n      patient   s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-MAGE-A3\n      incorporated in the retrovirus.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-MAGE A3\n      cells) cause tumors to shrink and to be certain the treatment is safe\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults age 18   66 with cancer containing the MAGE-A3 molecule.\n\n      Design:\n\n      Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo\n      a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed\n\n      Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo\n      leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells.  {Leukapheresis is a\n      common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}\n\n      Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for\n      the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO 1 cells and aldesleukin.  They will stay in the\n      hospital for about 1-2 weeks to recover from the treatment.\n\n      Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests,\n      and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as\n      long as their tumors are shrinking."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n        -  We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both alpha and beta chains\n           of a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the HLA-A 01 restricted MAGE-A3 tumor\n           antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high\n           efficiency.\n\n        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A 01 and MAGE-A3 double positive tumors, the anti-MAGE-A3- A 01\n           restricted (anti-MAGE-A3-01) TCR transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of\n           IFN- >= with high specificity.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Primary objectives:\n\n        -  Determine a safe dose of administration of autologous T cells transduced with an anti-\n           MAGE-A3 HLA-A 01-restricted TCR (MAGE-A3-01) TCR and aldesleukin to patients following\n           a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.\n\n        -  Determine if this approach will result in objective tumor regression in patients with\n           metastatic cancer expressing MAGE-A3.\n\n        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.\n\n      Secondary Objective:\n\n      - Determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Patients who are HLA-A 01 positive and 18 years of age or older must have:\n\n        -  Metastatic cancer whose tumors express the MAGE-A3 antigen;\n\n        -  Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred following at least one\n           first line treatment for metastatic disease;\n\n      Patients may not have:\n\n      - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be transduced with the retroviral vector\n           supernatant encoding the anti-MAGE-A3 HLA-A 01-restricted TCR.\n\n        -  The study will begin with a phase I dose escalation. After the MTD cell dose has been\n           determined, patients will be enrolled into the phase 2 portion of the trial at the MTD\n           established during the phase I portion of the study. In the phase 2 portion, patients\n           will be entered into two cohorts: cohort 1 will include patients with metastatic\n           melanoma; cohort 2 will include patients with renal cancer and other types of\n           metastatic cancer.\n\n        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen\n           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex\n           vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus IV aldesleukin.\n\n        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor response every 1-6 months until off\n           study criteria are met.\n\n        -  For each of the 2 strata evaluated in the phase 2 portion, the study will be conducted\n           using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled.\n           For each of these two arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a\n           clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the\n           first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will\n           continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.\n\n        -  For both strata, the objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is able to\n           be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of\n           a modes 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).\n\n        -  In order to complete the dose escalation phase and both phase 2 cohorts, a total of up\n           to 20+82=102 patients may be required (20 + 2 strata with a maximum of 41 apiece). Up\n           to 6 patients enrolled at the MTD will count towards the accrual in the appropriate\n           phase 2 strata if they are evaluable for response and if they would be fully eligible\n           for enrollment in the phase 2 portion of the trial. Provided that about 4-5 patients\n           per month will be able to be enrolled onto this trial, approximately 2 to 3 years may\n           be needed to accrue the maximum number of required patients."
