            "textblock": "Taxotere is the current standard first-line chemotherapy for mCRPC and may be used as\n      second-line therapy in good responders in first-line (Taxotere rechallenge). Jevtana has\n      demonstrated a survival benefit versus mitoxantrone in patients progressing during or after\n      Taxotere and is now the standard second-line chemotherapy. Taxotere and Jevtana have\n      different toxicity profiles.\n\n      Many patients who are receiving Jevtana for second-line treatment indicate they prefer this\n      agent over Taxotere with regards to the general tolerance (namely peripheral neuropathy,\n      nail changes, asthenia). This was not expected since Jevtana in post-Taxotere setting was\n      associated with more grade 3-4 adverse events such as febrile neutropenia and diarrhea than\n      Taxotere in first-line setting.\n\n      The study design of CABA-DOC is similar to that of the PISCES trial which evaluated the\n      patient preference between two standard treatments for first-line metastatic kidney cancer.\n      Despite similar PFS improvements over placebo in phase III trials, results clearly showed\n      that patients preferred pazopanib over sunitinib.\n\n      A randomized phase III study is currently comparing the efficacy of Taxotere and Jevtana in\n      first-line setting with overall survival as a primary end-point. Assessing patient\n      preference between Jevtana and Taxotere would contribute to further identify differences\n      between these two taxanes and clarify which one of these two taxanes should be used for\n      second-line chemotherapy and perhaps for first-line chemotherapy in the future.\n\n      Assessing patient preference between the two taxanes might be less biased in the first-line\n      setting where patients have no previous experience with a taxane."
