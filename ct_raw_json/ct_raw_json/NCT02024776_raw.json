A poor physical condition and functional status reduces the ability of a person\n      to cope, mentally and physically, with hospitalization and surgery and may compromise\n      functional recovery, potentially leading to postoperative complications and death.\n      Prehabilitation aims to enhance functional capacity preoperatively for better toleration of\n      surgery and to facilitate recovery and eventually the prognosis of the surgical patient.\n      Whereas the benefits of cardiopulmonary fitness programs are well established, the\n      accessibility, sustainability of effects, and impact on the surgical outcome of these\n      programs are unsolved issues. Wellness programs based on integrated care services supported\n      by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can overcome such limitations. The\n      investigators hypothesized that a prehabilitation program, inducing beneficial effects on\n      exercise capacity, may improve the surgical outcome in high-risk patients. Moreover, ICT\n      support may contribute to increase the adherence and sustainability of this intervention."
