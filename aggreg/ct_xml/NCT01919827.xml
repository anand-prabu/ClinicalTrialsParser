      Clinical Trial Phase I, open, multicentric, non randomized, study with escalating doses, to
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of treatment with mesenchymal stem cells in patients
      with diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

      Primary endpoint: The aim is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the endobronchial
      administration of mesenchymal autolog stem cells derived from bone marrow (BM-MSC)in
      patients with mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

      Secondary endpoint:Assess the possible effect of the infusion of BM-MSC in stopping the fall
      of pulmonary function in patients with mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Capacity for signing informing consent and express the willing to fulfill all the
             requirements of the study protocol during the study.

          2. The patients should be, in the researcher opinion, capable to fulfill all the
             requirements of the trial.

          3. Male or female patients, 30 to 80 years old, inclusive.

          4. Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis according to the following criteria, based
             on the ATS/ERS Guidelines:

               1. Definite or probable usual interstitial pneumonia confirmed by surgical lung
                  biopsy.

               2. In the absence of surgical lung biopsy, all the following:

             i. High resolution CT (HRCT) showing definite findings for idiopathic pulmonary
             fibrosis (FPI): bibasal reticular opacities with minimal ground glass opacities.

             ii. Absence of other known causes of FPI including toxicity from drugs, environmental
             exposure or connective tissue diseases.

             iii. Pulmonary function tests showing ventilatory restrictive pattern and/or impaired
             gas exchange (FVC and/or DLCO &lt;90% of predicted)

          5. FVC ≥ 50% of predicted value with ratio of FEV1 to FVC ≥ 0.70.

          6. DLco (corrected for hemoglobin) ≥ 35% predicted value.
