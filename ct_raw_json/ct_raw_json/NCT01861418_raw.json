To examine the within-day and between-day test-retest reliability of a testing protocol\n           measuring the back and hip muscles fatigability using EMG median frequency\n\n        2. To examine the immediate and the carry-over effects of the lumbopelvic manipulation on\n           the EMG median frequency of the lumbar multifidus (MULT), gluteus medius (GMED) and\n           gluteus maximus (GMAX) muscles in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP)\n\n        3. To compare the fatigability levels of the MULT, GMED and GMAX muscles by measuring the\n           EMG median frequency between the participants who will receive lumbopelvic\n           manipulation.\n\n      The research hypotheses are:\n\n        1. The testing protocol using EMG median frequency as a fatigue indicator for MULT,GMED\n           and GMAX muscles will have good (ICC \u2265 0.80) within-day and between-day test-retest\n           reliability.\n\n        2. The fatigability level of the MULT, GMED and GMAX muscles will significantly decrease\n           immediately after the lumbopelvic manipulation and will be maintained over two to four\n           days following the manipulation.\n\n        3. The fatigability of the MULT, GMED and GMAX muscles will significantly decrease after\n           the intervention in the manipulation group while no change will occur in the placebo\n           group."
