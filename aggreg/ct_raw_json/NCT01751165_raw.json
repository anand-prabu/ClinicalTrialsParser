Inhaled, topical and intra-articular\n             corticosteroids are allowed.\n\n          -  Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30\n             days before and ending 30 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n\n          -  Administration or planned administration of a non-replicating vaccine within eight\n             days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n\n          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs (e.g. infliximab) within six\n             months prior to the first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during\n             the study period.\n\n          -  Previous vaccination against varicella or HZ (either registered product or\n             participation in a previous vaccine study).\n\n          -  Planned administration during the study of an HZ or varicella vaccine (including an\n             investigational or non-registered vaccine) other than the study vaccine.\n\n          -  History of HZ.\n\n          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component\n             of the vaccine(s).\n\n          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting\n             from disease (e.g. malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) or\n             immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (e.g. medications used during cancer\n             chemotherapy, organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders).\n\n          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n               -  Fever is defined as temperature \u2265 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) for oral, axillary or tympanic\n                  route, or \u2265 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) for rectal route. The preferred route for recording\n                  temperature in this study will be oral.\n\n               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory\n                  infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months\n             preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study\n             period.\n\n          -  Significant underlying illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would be\n             expected to prevent completion of the study.\n\n          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with\n             the evaluations required by the study.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating female.\n\n          -  Female planning to become pregnant during the entire treatment period and for two\n             months after completion of the vaccination series, or planning to discontinue\n             contraceptive precautions (if of childbearing potential)."
