  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (how the drug concentrations
      change over time) of abiraterone acetate after oral administration of abiraterone acetate at
      different dose levels of 250, 500, and 1000 mg in healthy Chinese male participants under
      fasted conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the
      treatment sequence is assigned by chance), 3-way crossover study (method used to switch
      participants from one dose level to another in a clinical study) of single doses of
      abiraterone acetate in healthy Chinese male participants. The study consists of 3 phases:
      screening, open-label treatment, and follow up phases. After screening, randomly assigned
      participants will receive different dose levels of abiraterone acetate (Treatment A = 250
      mg; Treatment B = 500 mg; and Treatment C = 1000 mg) on Day 1 in each of the 3 treatment
      periods according to a randomized schedule under fasted conditions (Sequence 1 = ABC;
      Sequence 2 = BAC; and Sequence 3 = CBA). Each treatment period will be separated by a
      washout period (period when participant is not receiving any study medication) of at least 7
      days. In the follow-up phase, study-related adverse events will be monitored by the
      investigator. Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected and safety
      will be monitored throughout the study. The total study duration will be approximately 42
      days.
