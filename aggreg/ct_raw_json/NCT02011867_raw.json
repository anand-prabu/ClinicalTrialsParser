It was used in 50 patients with different inner ear malformations.\n      Thirteen patients had gusher, and 11 patients oozing during cochleostomy. One patient with\n      initial prototype of the cork electrode had to be revised because of persistent oozing\n      around the electrode. Another patient had slow extrusion of the electrode most probably due\n      to CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) pulsation and had to be revised. Both patients had no more CSF\n      fistula.\n\n      CSF fistula in inner ear malformations is a serious situation which may lead to recurrent\n      meningitis.
