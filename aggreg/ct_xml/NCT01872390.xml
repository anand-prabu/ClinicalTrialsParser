  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lesotho, a small, landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa, is among the
      world's poorest nations with one of the world's most severe epidemics of HIV and
      tuberculosis (TB). There is strong evidence that TB patients who are also infected with HIV
      have better survival rates if they begin antiretroviral therapy (ART) soon after starting TB
      treatment; however, there are many  patients who do not initiate ART within the recommended
      timeframe, and who do not remain in care.

      The purpose of the START Study is to identify an effective, cost-effective, acceptable
      intervention that addresses programmatic, structural and psychosocial barriers to ART
      initiation and retention during TB treatment, with the ultimate goal of improving health
      outcomes among HIV-infected TB patients in Lesotho. The study is a two-arm cluster
      randomized trial, randomized at the TB/HIV clinic level, which includes twelve TB/HIV
      clinics in Berea district. Clinics are randomized to deliver the combination intervention
      package (CIP) or standard of care (SOC), with stratification by facility type.  The
      experimental intervention will be delivered to all HIV-infected TB patients in TB/HIV
      clinics randomly assigned to CIP. In TB/HIV clinics assigned to SOC, usual care procedures
      for ART initiation and retention will be delivered.

      Study hypotheses focus on the effectiveness of the CIP on HIV- and TB-related outcomes.

      Compared to HIV-infected TB patients attending SOC clinics, HIV-infected TB patients at CIP
      clinics will have superior HIV- and TB-related outcomes, including:

        -  Greater ART initiation during TB treatment

        -  Shorter time to ART initiation

        -  Greater retention in ART care

        -  Higher adherence to ART

        -  Greater change in CD4+ count

        -  Greater TB treatment success (completion and cure)

        -  Greater sputum smear conversion

        -  Higher adherence to TB treatment

      Additionally, CIP delivery will have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio more favorable
      than alternative resource uses.

      The study intervention, combination intervention package (CIP), will contain multiple
      components, including: 1) nurse training and mentorship in TB/HIV co-treatment using a
      clinical algorithm; 2) reimbursement of transportation costs to monthly clinic visits for
      patients and their treatment supporters; 3) health education using a TB and HIV treatment
      literacy curriculum for patients and treatment supporters; and 4) real-time adherence
      support using short message service (SMS) text messaging and trained village health workers
      (VHW). Nurses and VHW will be trained to deliver the intervention to all TB/HIV patients in
      CIP clinics. Participants in this study will complete their monthly clinic visits with
      clinic staff, per routine care.

      Data will be collected from all HIV-infected TB patients newly enrolled in care; from a
      subset of patients enrolled into a measurement cohort (MC); from program characteristics
      surveys conducted at the study sites; and from key informant groups.  Routine clinic data
      from all HIV-infected TB patients newly registered at the 12 participating clinics during
      the period of observation will be used to measure the following outcomes: ART initiation,
      time to ART initiation, TB treatment success, and sputum smear conversion. These data will
      be collected by Research Assistants by abstracting the following information from the clinic
      TB and ART registers during the period of observation on all newly registered TB/HIV
      patients: date of TB treatment initiation; ART initiation (yes/no); date of ART initiation
      (if applicable); TB treatment outcomes (completion, cure, failure, death, default); TB type;
      and all sputum smear results.

      A measurement cohort (MC) of 384 HIV-infected TB patients initiating ART will be recruited
      from the 12 clinics (n=192 per study arm). MC participants will be assessed at baseline
      (enrollment) and monthly intervals for six to nine months, depending on the duration of TB
      treatment. Outcomes to be measured among MC participants include: retention in ART care,
      adherence to ART, change in CD4+ count, adherence to TB treatment, and side effects/adverse
      events. MC participants at both SOC and CIP sites will receive the same assessments.
      Research Assistants will administer assessments on the day of regularly scheduled clinic
      visits, including a Baseline interview administered on the day of enrollment (which
      coincides with the day a participant initiates ART), Monthly Follow-Up interviews completed
      throughout TB treatment on a monthly basis, and an End of Treatment interview that is
      completed on the day the participant ends TB treatment. Participants who miss a study visit
      will be contacted by study staff and administered the questionnaire over the phone within a
      1-week window period.  Research Assistants will also call the MC participants between clinic
      visits to conduct unannounced pill counts to assess medication adherence.

      Cost drivers associated with CIP, including program, medical, and patient costs, will be
      collected.

      Research Assistants (RAs) will conduct an assessment of programmatic activities at each
      TB/HIV clinic prior to study implementation and on a monthly basis thereafter. Clinics in
      both conditions will receive the same assessments. The RA will administer a brief
      semi-structured Program Characteristics survey to the nurse in charge, who will be most
      familiar with the day-to-day operations of the TB/HIV clinic. The survey will assess nurse
      training and mentorship in TB/HIV cotreatment, availability and use of a TB/HIV clinical
      algorithm, TB/HIV adherence training for VHW, TB/HIV health education for patients and
      treatment supporters, availability and use of a TB/HIV treatment literacy curriculum,
      reimbursement for transportation costs for patients and treatment supporters, provision of
      air-time vouchers for TB/HIV patients on ART, use of SMS messaging for adherence support and
      appointment reminders, and provision of community-based adherence and side effect monitoring
      by VHW. These data will be used to assess fidelity with the intervention at CIP sites, as
      well as to measure any potential contamination at SOC sites.  Additional cost information
      will be analyzed from the expenditures associated with parts of the CIP, as paid for by the
      study budget.

      Three key informant (KI) groups will be recruited from CIP clinics: ART initiators (n=30),
      ART non-initiators (n=30), and health care workers (including nurses and VHW) (n=30). KI
      interviews will assess: acceptability and preferences of intervention components, as well as
      reasons for ART non-initiation. Senior Research Assistants will use Key Informant interview
      (KII) guides developed by the investigators to conduct semi-structured interviews with KI
      recruited from CIP sites. Each interview will be digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim,
      and translated to English. Acceptability, preferences and utilization of intervention
      components will be explored among CIP participants in the measurement cohort at the end of
      TB treatment. Reasons for non-initiation of ART will be explored among TB/HIV patients who
      have completed TB treatment at a CIP site and have never initiated ART. Healthcare worker
      experiences delivering the intervention, perceived barriers and facilitators, perceptions
      about acceptability and ease of uptake and delivery of the various components of the
      intervention will be explored among nurses and VHW at CIP sites.

      All clinical care, including implementation of the combination intervention package at sites
      randomized to CIP, will be performed by Lesotho Ministry of Health clinic staff (nurses and
      VHW). All study procedures, including participant interviews, pill counts, medical record
      abstraction, and program characteristics surveys will be performed by study staff (Research
      Assistants). Following routine clinic visits, clinic staff will refer potentially eligible
      patients to study staff, who will screen for eligibility, obtain informed consent, and
      enroll consenting eligible patients into the measurement cohort.

    <description>At SOC clinics, usual procedures for management of HIV-infected TB patients will be followed. At health centers, TB and HIV services are fully integrated in a one-stop model, while at hospitals, ART is provided in the TB clinic for TB/HIV coinfected patients. Nurses, lay counselors, and VHW provide TB/HIV services. Lay counselors offer HIV counseling and testing to all TB patients. As per national guidelines, HIV-infected TB patients are to be started on ART two to four weeks after initiating TB treatment, regardless of CD4+ count.  Directly observed therapy is usually provided in the community by a treatment supporter, who is usually a family member. TB/HIV patients return to the health facility monthly for a 30-day supply of medications and monitoring of side effects and adherence.</description>
