Through the use of\n      a foot measurement model in 3D motion analysis the influence of the devices with respect to\n      a mechanical effect is examined by means of different tests. The dynamic postural control is\n      quantified.  The hypothesis was that the devices would stabilize differently the foot\n      segments."
