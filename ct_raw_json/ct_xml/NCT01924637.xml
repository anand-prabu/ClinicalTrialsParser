  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the
      pharmacokinetic (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamic (the effect
      of the investigated drug on the body) properties of FIAsp (faster-acting insulin aspart) in
      subjects with type 1 diabetes.
