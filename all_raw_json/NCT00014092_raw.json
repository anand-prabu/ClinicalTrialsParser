Biological therapies such as interleukin-2 and interferon alfa\n      stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells or may interfere with the growth\n      of cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapies may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide followed by sargramostim,\n      interleukin-2, and interferon alfa in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma that\n      cannot be treated with surgery."

Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4-8\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with at\n      least stable or responsive disease after 8 courses of therapy may receive additional therapy\n      at investigators discretion.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 8 weeks during study, and then at 1 month\n      after study.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
