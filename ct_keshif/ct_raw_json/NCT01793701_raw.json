Three dose levels will be investigated, (although, the first dose level is considered to be the equivalent to a standard pelvic dose with parametrial boost).  Before moving to the next dose level it must be confirmed by the Chief Investigator that the Maximum Administrable Dose (MAD) has not been met in the previous dose level (see section 6.3).  If MAD is reached before dose level 3 the study will stop.  All patients enrolled on the study will undergo the same procedures at the same time points, regardless of the dose level they are being given (see section 5)."
