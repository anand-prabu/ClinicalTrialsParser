Rapid recovery occurred once\n      glucocorticoids were discontinued, and fracture rates returned to expected for age by 1 year\n      after treatment (Journal Of Clinical  Endocrinology & Metabolism 2009). The investigators\n      will study the role of bisphosphonates in the prevention of secondary osteoporosis in\n      children & adolescents treated for ALL  in  the Children's Cancer Hospital -Egypt."
