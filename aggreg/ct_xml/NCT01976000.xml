  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been widely accepted worldwide; however, despite the
      well-known benefits and comparable oncological outcomes, it is still limited by a lack of
      tactile sensation and a reduced operative field view. In addition, the inconsistency in the
      number and course of the mesenteric vessels significantly influences the learning curve with
      30 to 70 cases required for proficiency. To overcome these limitations, the vascular anatomy
      can be mapped using CT-angiography, and the images can be processed with rendering software
      to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of the mesenteric vessels. The aim of this study
      was to assess the influence of visualizing the three-dimensional vascular anatomy on the
      learning curve for laparoscopic colorectal surgery.All patients who underwent laparoscopic
      left or right hemicolectomies between January 2010 and January 2013 were evaluated for
      inclusion in this study. To assess the influence of preliminary knowledge of colonic
      vascular anatomy on the learning curve, we considered 2 groups of three surgeons with
      different levels of experience. In the first group (group A), the surgeons were able to view
      3D reconstructions before and during the surgery, while the surgeons in Group B were only
      able to view the 3D reconstructions after surgery.

        We included only patients in which standard laparoscopic right or left hemicolectomy was
        planned and who needed a CT scan but had not received a scan prior to their first office
        visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in which standard laparoscopic right or left hemicolectomy was planned

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who underwent extended right hemicolectomy and segmental colectomy or
             sigmoidectomy and patients for whom the surgical technique was modified
             intraoperatively

          -  patients who underwent anterior rectal resection and emergency procedures for
             complicated diverticulitis were excluded because these procedures require higher
             technical skills.

          -  Patients who had an ASA score of IV, a BMI over 40 or contraindications for
             laparoscopy were also excluded.
