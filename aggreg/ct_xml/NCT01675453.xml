  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The organ dysfunction following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) occurs frequently in cardiac
      surgery patients. Systemic inflammatory response initiated by CPB through releasing of
      several mediators lead to altered endothelial integrity and in consequence the leakage of
      proteins and fluids from the intravascular to the interstitial compartment is occurred.
      Increased capillary permeability and decreased colloid osmotic pressure were shown to play a
      key role for fluid shift and increasing of extravascular water. Further tissue edema can
      result in injury to many organs, including the heart, lungs, brain, kidneys and can lead to
      adverse outcomes.

      Hypertonic solution creates an osmotic gradient across the cellular membrane, causing a
      fluid shift from the intracellular and the interstitial spaces of tissue into the
      intravascular compartment.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of 7.2% NaCl plus 6%
      hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 in patients scheduled for first-time coronary artery bypass
      grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass.
