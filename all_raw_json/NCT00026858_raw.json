Techniques for administering that treatment, including patient positioning,\n      lung and soft tissue compensation, dose rate, total dose and fractionation differ between\n      institutions.  These differences are optimized at each institution to limit toxicity and\n      maximize therapeutic outcome.\n\n      Technically complex procedures such as total body radiation are subject to equipment\n      failures.  Such failures mid-treatment could be catastrophic to the patient, since therapy\n      must be timely and compatible therapy may not be available elsewhere in the community.  The\n      purpose of this protocol is to provide backup between George Washington University Medical\n      Center and the Radiation Oncology Branch of the NCI to allow for orderly, safe, and\n      compatible therapies in the event of equipment failure; or replacement of a linear\n      accelerator or any other malfunctioning equipment necessary to deliver TBI; or any emergent\n      situation."
