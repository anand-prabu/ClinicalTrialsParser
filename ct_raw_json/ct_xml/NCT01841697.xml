  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority study comparing MK-3102 with Sitagliptin in participants with type
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy. The
      primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c
      (A1C) in participants treated with MK-3102 is non-inferior to that in participants treated
      with sitagliptin.  There will be a 2-week run-in period with placebo + metformin prior to
      the double-blind treatment period.
