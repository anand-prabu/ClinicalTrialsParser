Specifically will be estimating the recruitment rates of patients\n           and the compliance with both interventions.\n\n        2. Measure the safety and tolerance of adding night-time sedation with dexmedetomidine\n           using adverse effects and withdrawal rates as indicators.\n\n        3. Measure the effect of nocturnal dexmedetomidine on pertinent clinical outcomes and use\n           this outcome data to plan a larger, multicenter trial in this area.\n\n      The goal of this study is to determine whether a night-time protocol that incorporates a\n      pharmacologic intervention associated with improved sleep (i.e. dexmedetomidine) will\n      improve sleep quality and reduce the incidence of delirium and sub-syndromal delirium in\n      critically ill patients."
