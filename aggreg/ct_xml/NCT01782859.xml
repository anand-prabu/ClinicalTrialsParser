  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that surgery causes some reactions in your body consistent with
      inflammation.  When the inflammation is extensive, it may affect different parts of the body
      including the lungs. Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat inflammation and are
      different from performance enhancing steroids associated with athletics.  The purpose of
      this study is to determine the influence of low dose steroids given 3 times in a 24 hour
      period on thrombotic markers (markers that are associated with increased risks of clotting,
      a possible complication of surgery), IL-6 cytokine release (part of the stress response seen
      with surgery), and urine desmosine levels (a marker of lung injury) in a randomized placebo
      controlled trial patients undergoing total hip replacement.
