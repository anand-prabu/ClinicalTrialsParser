Patients must\n             currently be receiving methotrexate (MTX) therapy.\n\n          -  Current treatment for RA on an outpatient basis:\n\n               1. Must be receiving and tolerating oral or parenteral MTX therapy at a dose of 15\n                  to 25 mg per week (dose may be as low as 10 mg per week if the patient is unable\n                  to tolerate a higher dose) for at least 12 weeks immediately prior to Day 1. The\n                  dose and administration route should remain stable for at least 4 weeks prior to\n                  Day 1 until Week 24. After Week 24 the administration route can be changed at\n                  the investigator's discretion. Patients receiving a lower dose of MTX (10 to 14\n                  mg/week) should be doing so as a result of a documented history of intolerance\n                  to higher doses of MTX.\n\n               2. Patients must be willing to receive oral folic acid (at least 5 mg/week or as\n                  per local practice) or folinic acid (at least 1 mg/week or as per local\n                  practice) or equivalent during the entire trial (mandatory comedication for MTX\n                  treatment).\n\n               3. Disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use will be restricted according to\n                  guidelines listed in the trial protocol.\n\n               4. If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids (other than\n                  intra-articular or parenteral), the dose must not exceed 10 mg/day prednisolone\n                  or equivalent. During the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Day 1) the dose must remain\n                  stable.\n\n               5. Any concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable\n                  for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.\n\n               6. Patients may be taking oral hydroxychloroquine provided that the dose is not\n                  greater than 400 mg/day or chloroquine provided that the dose is not greater\n                  than 250 mg/day. These doses must have been stable for a minimum of 12 weeks\n                  prior to Day 1. The hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment will need to be\n                  continued at a stable dose with the same formulation until the end of the trial.\n\n          -  For participants of reproductive potential (males and females), a reliable means of\n             contraception (acceptable methods of birth control are intrauterine devices [IUDs],\n             surgical sterilization, double barrier, or vasectomized partner) has to be used\n             throughout trial participation.
