BMS-936559 is a drug that has been studied in\n      previous clinical trials to treat various types of cancer. The purpose of this study is to\n      evaluate the safety, PK, and immunotherapeutic activity of a single dose of BMS-936559\n      (administered by an IV infusion) in HIV-infected people who are receiving cART and who have\n      viral loads below the limit of detection. Researchers will also evaluate whether BMS-936559\n      can reduce hidden reservoirs of HIV.\n\n      Participants will be enrolled in four cohorts. Within each cohort, participants will be\n      randomly assigned to receive BMS-936559 (Cohort 1: 0.3 mg/kg; Cohort 2: 1 mg/kg; Cohort 3: 3\n      mg/kg; or Cohort 4: 10 mg/kg) or placebo. The four cohorts will be enrolled sequentially,\n      with researchers reviewing safety data of the cohort before enrolling participants in the\n      next cohort.\n\n      Prior to study entry, all participants must have an eye exam. At study entry, participants\n      will undergo a medical and medication history review, physical examination, blood\n      collection, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). Some female participants will have a pregnancy\n      test. All participants will then receive a single IV infusion of their assigned dose of\n      BMS-936559 or placebo. The infusion will occur over a period of 60 minutes, and participants\n      will remain in the clinic for observation for an additional 12 hours. Additional study\n      visits will occur at Days 3, 7, 14, 28, and Weeks 10, 16, 24, 36, and 48. These study visits\n      may include a physical examination, blood collection, adherence assessments, and PK\n      evaluations."
