Combining different types of biological therapies, including\n      interferon alfa, interleukin-2, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, may kill more cancer\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapies, including\n      interferon alfa, interleukin-2, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, in treating patients\n      with metastatic cancer."

Determine the response rate and failure-free survival in patients with\n      metastatic cancer (preferably melanoma or renal cell) treated with autologous tumor\n      infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), interferon alfa (IFN-A), and interleukin-2 (IL-2). II.\n      Describe the toxic effects and costs associated with this therapy to assess risk benefit and\n      cost benefit. III. Assess the relative value of administering low- or high-dose TIL, as well\n      as the value of administering IFN-A before TIL, IL-2 with TIL, or cimetidine with TIL.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, tumor\n      infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) dose (low vs high), and medical condition suitable for\n      interferon alfa (IFN-A)/interleukin-2 (IL-2) (yes vs no). Patients are assigned to one of\n      two treatment regimens based on entry criteria. Regimen A (preferred): Patients meeting the\n      preferred entry criteria receive IFN-A subcutaneously on days 1-4, TIL expanded in vitro\n      with IL-2 IV on day 5, and IL-2 IV continuously over 72 hours following TIL infusion.\n      Regimen B: All other patients receive TIL infusion once followed by oral cimetidine every 6\n      hours for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats in both regimens every 3-6 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression and according to TIL availability. Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients with melanoma and 20-30 patients with renal\n      cell carcinoma will be accrued for this study."
