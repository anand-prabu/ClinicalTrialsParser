  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of the present proposal are to 1) compare inhaled albuterol-induced changes in
      airway blood flow (Qaw), and in CO and Ppas in healthy current smokers and lifetime
      non-smokers as an index of endothelial function in the airway and pulmonary circulations, 2)
      compare the results between smokers and non-smokers, and 3) determine the effect of a 4-week
      treatment with an ICS on albuterol responsiveness of Qaw and the echocardiographic
      parameters. With this protocol the Investigators will test the hypotheses that a) there is a
      correlation between airway and pulmonary vascular endothelial function within the current
      smoker and non-smoker groups, and b) ICS treatment improves airway and pulmonary vascular
      endothelial function in the current smoker group.

      With this protocol the Investigators will test the hypotheses that a) there is a correlation
      between airway and pulmonary vascular endothelial function within the current smoker and
      non-smoker groups, and b) ICS treatment improves airway and pulmonary vascular endothelial
      function in the current smoker group.

      Fifteen healthy current smokers with a &gt;10 pack-year history of smoking and 15 healthy
      never-smokers will be enrolled. Males and females between 25 and 75 years of age will be
      recruited There will be 1-4 visits to the laboratory (one for non-smokers, 4 for smokers).
      All subjects will have the first visit. Current smokers will have 3 additional visits.
      Current smokers will be asked not to smoke before coming to the laboratory on the 3 study
      days. All subjects will be instructed to abstain from ingesting alcoholic beverages, coffee
      or caffeinated drinks for at least 12 hours the night before each study day. The subjects
      will also be instructed not to use PDE5 inhibitors for 24 hours before coming to the
      laboratory. On each study day, the protocol will start at the same time (in the morning).
