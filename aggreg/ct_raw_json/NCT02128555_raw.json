A total of 328 patients will be randomly allocated on an equal basis to one of two\n      surgical treatments: i) Total Ankle Replacement; and ii) Ankle Arthrodesis.  Randomisation\n      will be stratified by surgeon and presence of OA in two adjacent joints as determined by a\n      pre-operative MRI scan."
