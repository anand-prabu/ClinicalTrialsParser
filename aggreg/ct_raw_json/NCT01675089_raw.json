Because of lack of data on safety and an increased risk of adverse\n      effects, the use of these drugs is controversial in patients with chronic kidney disease\n      (CKD) and abnormalities of PTH or vitamin D, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\n      less than 30 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2 (CKD stages 4 and 5) and after transplantation. The efficacy of\n      short and long term bisphosphonate treatment after kidney transplantation has been examined;\n      however, histomorphometric and fracture rate reduction data are lacking.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether zolendronic acid, a third generation\n      bisphosphonate, is effective in preventing bone loss in the first year after kidney\n      transplantation."
