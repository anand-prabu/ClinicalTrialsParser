The test also measures the volume of plasma and of red cells in the blood.\n\n      The other test is called a venous plethysmography, which is a non-invasive test to measure\n      how well your veins and arteries in your forearm and calf work. Venous plethysmography\n      measures the changes in the dimensions of your limbs by the use of strain gauges placed on\n      the skin."
