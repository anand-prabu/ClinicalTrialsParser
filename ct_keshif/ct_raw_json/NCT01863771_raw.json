Approximately 200 participants will participate in\n      this study. This study will consist of an induction phase, a maintenance phase, and a\n      follow-up phase. During the induction phase (lasting 6 weeks) participants will receive 200\n      mg subcutaneous (SC) (under the skin) golimumab at Week 0 and 100 mg SC golimumab at Week 2.\n      During the maintenance phase (up to Week 52) all participants who show a clinical response\n      (measure of therapeutic effect of study medication) to golimumab during the induction phase\n      will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SC administration of placebo\n      (Group 1) or 100 mg golimumab (Group 2) every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 52. Participants\n      who do not show clinical response to golimumab will also receive 100 mg SC administration of\n      golimumab until Week 4 and if, by Week 8 of the maintenance phase, these participant's\n      disease activity does not appear to be improving, participants will be discontinued from\n      further study medication administration and will be followed up for safety evaluations 16\n      weeks after the last administration of study medication. However, if disease activity of\n      these participants improves at Week 8, they will continue to receive golimumab (100 mg every\n      4 weeks) through Week 52 of the maintenance phase. The follow-up phase will be of 16 weeks\n      duration. During this study, any participant who have a clinical response during the\n      induction phase but lose clinical response at any time will be eligible for dose adjustment\n      only once as follows: 1) participants receiving placebo (Group 1) will receive golimumab 100\n      mg; 2) participants receiving golimumab 100 mg (Group 2) will continue to receive golimumab\n      100 mg. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, laboratory\n      measurements, antinuclear antibodies/anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies,\n      and vital signs. The maximum study duration for a participant will be 68 weeks."
