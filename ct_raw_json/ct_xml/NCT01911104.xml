      STUDY OBJECTIVES/ENDPOINTS

        1. The primary endpoint of the study is the maximal capacity for mitochondrial ATP
           synthesis measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

        2. The principal secondary endpoint is the relationship between exercise-induced changes
           in mitochondrial function in vivo and exercise mimetic-induced changes in mitochondrial
           function in vitro.

        3. The principal tertiary endpoint is the relationship between the basal promoter
           methylation status of key genes involved in fuel metabolism and known to be activated
           by exercise in skeletal muscle tissue and cells and the exercise-induced response in
           mitochondrial function.

      As exercise has an array of metabolic effects, and we are well positioned with our
      cutting-edge methodologies here at the Translational Research Institute (TRI), we will also
      measure whole body insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility by
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, substrate oxidation and energy expenditure in the whole
      room calorimeter/metabolic chamber and intramyocellular lipid content.
