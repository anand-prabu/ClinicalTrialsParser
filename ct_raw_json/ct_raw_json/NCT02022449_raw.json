Hypothesis: The intervention group will show\n      decreased levels of cortisol and improved health behaviors from pre- to post-intervention\n      when compared with the control group. We will also explore whether intervention-related\n      changes in these parameters predict symptoms of illness. Exploratory Aim 2. To explore\n      psychological pathways of intervention-related decreases in distress among mothers,\n      including the perception of social support and the use of behavioral coping strategies that\n      are components of the intervention. Hypothesis: Increases in perceived social support and\n      use of active behavioral coping strategies will be associated with intervention-related\n      decreases in symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological stress."
