  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase III open-label, multicenter trial evaluating standard induction
      therapy (daunorubicin [DNR] and cytarabine [Ara-C]) and consolidation therapy (high-dose
      cytarabine [HDAC]) with or without dasatinib in adult patients with newly diagnosed CBF-AML;
      in the investigational arm, consolidation therapy is followed by a one-year maintenance
      therapy with dasatinib. Patients with molecular disease persistence or molecular relapse as
      assessed by quantitative RQ-PCR for the CBF fusion transcripts will be eligible for
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before overt hematologic relapse occurs. Primary
      endpoint is event-free survival.

      AML patients will be assessed for the CBF fusion genes in one of two AMLSG central
      laboratories within 48 hours of diagnosis, and only patients with CBF-AML will be enrolled.

    <description>Induction therapy:
Patients will receive induction therapy (one or two cycles) with daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/day administered on days 1-3 and cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day administered by continuous IV infusion on days 1-7. No dose reduction is planned in elderly (&gt;60 years) patients.
Consolidation therapy:
Patients  will receive 4 cycles of consolidation therapy. Consolidation therapy consists of high-dose cytarabine 3 g/m2 (&gt;60 years: 1 g/m2) q12h, days 1-3 administered intravenously over three hours.
Follow-up period:
There is no maintenance therapy in the standard arm. Patients will be closely followed, in particular for molecular disease persistence or molecular relapse.</description>

Consolidation therapy:
Patients will receive consolidation therapy for 4 cycles. Consolidation therapy consists of high-dose cytarabine 3 g/m2 (&gt;60 years: 1 g/m2) q12h, days 1-3 administered intravenously over three hours. Patients will receive dasatinib 100 mg QD on days 4-21.
Maintenance therapy:
Patients completing consolidation therapy will continue to receive single agent dasatinib 100 mg QD for one year (or until relapse).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Core-binding factor (CBF) AML with molecular diagnosis of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion
             transcript resulting from t(8;21)(q22;q22) (or a variant form) or of CBFB-MYH11
             fusion transcript resulting from inv(16)(p13.1q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) as assessed in
             one of the central AMLSG reference la-boratories (Ulm, Hannover)

          -  Age ≥ 18; there is no upper age limit

          -  No prior chemotherapy for leukemia except hydroxyurea for up to 5 days during the
             diagnostic screening phase

          -  Non-pregnant and non-nursing. Due to the unknown teratogenic potential of dasatinib
             in humans, pregnant or nursing patients may not be enrolled. Women of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within a
             sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL with-in 72 hours prior to registration. Women of
             child-bearing potential must either commit to contin-ued abstinence from heterosexual
             intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control - one highly effective
             method (e.g., IUD, hormonal, tubal ligation, or partner's vasectomy), and one
             additional effective method (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap) - AT THE
             SAME TIME, at least four weeks before she begins dasatinib therapy. &quot;Women of
             childbearing potential&quot; is defined as a sexually active mature woman who has not
             undergone a hysterectomy or who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
             consecutive months.

          -  Men must agree not to father a child and must use a latex condom during any sexual
             contact with women of childbearing potential while taking dasatinib and for 3 months
             after therapy is stopped, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.

          -  Signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Performance status WHO &gt;2

          -  Pulmonary edema and/or pleural/pericardial effusion within 14 days of day 1. If
             edema/effusion resolves to CTC Grade ≤1, patients can be treated with dasatinib.

          -  Patients with ejection fraction &lt;50% by echocardiography within 14 days of day 1

          -  Organ insufficiency (creatinine &gt;1.5x upper normal serum level; bilirubin, AST or AP
             &gt;2.5x upper normal serum level; heart failure NYHA III/IV; severe obstructive or
             restrictive ventilation disorder)

          -  Uncontrolled infection

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers. Pa-tients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy, if
             they have completed therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than
             30% risk of relapse within one year.

          -  Severe neurological or psychiatric disorder interfering with ability of giving an
             informed consent

          -  Known positive for HIV, active HBV, HCV, or Hepatitis A infection

          -  Bleeding disorder independent of leukemia

          -  No consent for registration, storage and processing of the individual disease
             characteristics and course as well as information of the family physician and/or
             other physicians involved in the treatment of the patient about study participation.

          -  No consent for biobanking.
