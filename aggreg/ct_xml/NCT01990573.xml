  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of
      intraoperative methadone in reducing post-operative pain and opioid consumption in
      adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion.  Our secondary goal is to determine the
      pharmacokinetics of IV methadone in children (0.4 and 0.5 mg/kg).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, modified dose-escalation design.  Patients receive standard
      monitoring for anesthesia and postoperative care. Surgical and anesthesia (except for opioid
      use) care are not altered for study purposes. All patients are induced by propofol and
      muscle relaxants. In the first cohort (n=30 evaluable), subjects are randomized 1:2 to
      either control (standard intraop opioid at anesthesiologists' discretion) or methadone HCl
      (0.4 mg/kg ideal body weight, IBW). In the second cohort (n=30 evaluable), subjects are
      randomized 1:2 to either control (standard intraop opioid) or methadone HCl (0.5 mg/kg ideal
      body weight, IBW). Subjects in the study groups will receive methadone (IV bolus, after
      induction of anesthesia) as their primary intraoperative opioid, rather than leaving the
      choice of intraoperative opioid to the anesthesiologist. Intraoperative breakthrough pain
      will be treated at the discretion of the anesthesiologist with fentanyl. In the control
      groups, intraoperative opioid administration will be left at the discretion of the
      anesthesia providers. Patient controlled analgesia as prescribed by the clinical team, using
      hydromorphone or morphine, will be used to treat postoperative pain relief.

    <description>Assessments are made in the postoperative period by a trained member of the research team blinded to intraoperative use of methadone. These will be conducted on each post-operative day until discharge or post op day 6, whichever comes first.  Pain intensity is assessed using the Wong-Baker FACES scale employed by the inpatient nursing staff and previously validated (9).  Pain relief is also assessed using a Colored-Visual Analog Scale.  Sedation is assessed using a five-point scale (patient fully alert - not arousable).  Itching and nausea are assessed using a five-point verbal scale (none, mild, moderate, severe or excruciating).</description>
