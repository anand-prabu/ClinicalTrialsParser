The literature is not yet conclusive about the\n      optimal anesthestic technique. The optimal technique should support fast mobilization by\n      giving good pain relieve with minimal side effects such as nausea, drowsiness and muscle\n      weakness. If pain relieve is optimal, the patient mobilizes fast and length of stay is\n      shortened. But does fast recovery lead to better functional outcome? The objective of this\n      study is to determine whether either a femoral nerve block (FNB) or local infiltration\n      analgesia (LIA) is a better anesthetic technique to achieve optimal functional outcome after\n      one year in patients receiving a total knee arthroplasty and following a fast track\n      rehabilitation protocol."
