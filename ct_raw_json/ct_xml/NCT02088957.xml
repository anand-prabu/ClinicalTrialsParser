    <description>Subjects will receive an acute intravenous (iv) dose of Brivaracetam (BRV) 200 mg as a bolus on Day 1. If seizures recur, a second acute dose of BRV 100 mg can be given no sooner than 15 minutes after the first dose. If the second acute dose is not needed 12 hours after first acute iv dose, BRV will be continued as approximately 100 mg iv dose every 12 hours. The daily dose can be adapted according to investigator's clinical judgment, not exceeding a maximum dose of 400 mg per day for the first 24 hours of treatment. The rate of bolus administration is 50 mg (5 mL) undiluted BRV/min.  On Day 5 (or earlier), based on tolerability), subjects will transition from iv to oral formulation, at comparable dosing for a maximum of 6 months. If subjects require further iv BRV treatment, iv BRV will be continued in the follow up treatment period for a maximum of 6 months.
Subjects should transition to oral medication as soon as they are able to swallow tablets.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive an acute intravenous (iv) dose of Phenytoin (PHT) 20 mg/kg at a rate of 50 mg/min on Day 1. If seizures recur, a second acute dose of PHT iv will be given no sooner than 15 minutes after the first dose. Treatment with PHT iv will be continued with at least 2 daily divided doses according to site practice. Daily PHT dose can be adapted according to investigator's clinical judgment. On Day 5 (or earlier, based on tolerability), subjects will transition from iv to oral formulation at comparable dosing for a maximum of 6 months. If subject requires further iv PHT treatment, iv PHT will be continued in the follow up treatment period for a maximum of 6 months.
Subjects should transition to oral medication as soon as they are able to swallow tablets.</description>

    <description>Acute intravenous (iv) dose of Brivaracetam (BRV) 200 mg as a bolus is administered on Day 1. If seizures recur, a second acute dose of 100 mg can be given no sooner than 15 minutes after the first dose. BRV is then continued as approximately 100 mg iv dose every 12 hours for up to 5 days for subjects who can switch to oral dose. Daily dose can be adapted not exceeding a maximum dose of 400 mg per day for first 24 hours of treatment.
