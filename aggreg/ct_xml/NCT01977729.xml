  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in
      combination with sertraline (SRT) is more effective than SRT alone in treating children and
      adolescents with anxiety disorders (after an initial 8 weeks of CBT).

      This project proposes to conduct a pilot study to collect preliminary data on a
      'personalized adaptive treatment' approach for children and adolescents with anxiety
      disorders. All youth patients in this two site study will first receive CBT and all then
      will be re-assessed at mid-treatment (8 sessions). Patients who show a partial response or
      no response following 8 sessions of CBT will be randomized to either a switch to SRT alone
      or CBT augmentation with SRT.

    <description>Youth outcome will be assessed on a global level using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity Scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). Higher ratings indicate greater anxiety symptom severity. The CGI Improvement Scale ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Lower ratings indicate greater improvement on anxiety symptom severity. A CGI Improvement Scale rating of 1 or 2 indicates clinically meaningful improvements in anxiety symptom severity.</description>

    <description>Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-2; Self-report and Parent completed). Treatment outcome will be assessed on a specific symptom level from the youth's and parent's perspective using the MASC-2. The MASC-2 consists of 50 items across 5 factors: Separation Anxiety/Phobias, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety, Obsessions &amp; Compulsions, and Harm Avoidance. MASC T-scores less than 65 indicate the child is no longer in the clinical range of anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C). Negative affect (NA)  will be assessed using the NA subscale on the PANAS-C. The 15 NA items (e.g., sad, miserable) on the 27-item PANAS-C are scored 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). Higher scores in the NA subscale indicate higher levels of negative affect.</description>

    <description>CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)+SRT (Sertraline) will be scheduled at weeks 9-12, 14, 16, 18, 20 with telephone visits at weeks 15, 17, and 19. The same therapist as in Phase I will deliver CBT in Phase II, which will occur in conjunction with the psychiatrist visits. Phase II CBT will emphasize continued therapist prescribed in-session and out-of-session exposure tasks (developed with patient) and continued patient cognitive-affective processing of exposure sessions with therapist, with no instruction on new skills or therapeutic strategies. Therapists will be encouraged to discuss clinical status with patients, psychiatrists, and PIs to allow for treatment integration (e.g., psychiatrist could increase the dose of SRT, or not, depending on whether the patient Is making sufficient progress in CBT).</description>

    <description>Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Sertraline is FDA approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Sertraline is also approved for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder in children and adolescents. Pharmacotherapy visits will be scheduled at weeks 9-12, 14, 16, 18, 20 with phone visits at weeks 15, 17, and 19. The psychiatrist will meet for ~30 min. with the youth and parents. Efforts will be made to use the most effective and tolerated SRT dose.</description>

    <description>Medication will be administered daily using a &quot;fixed-flexible strategy&quot; beginning at 25mg, titrating to 200mg across 8 wks (i.e., wks 9-17). We expect patients' medication dose will be adjusted upward in 50 mg/day increments if clinician-rated CGI-S anxiety severity is 3 (mild) or greater. The dose will be held or adjusted downward if patients have few anxiety symptoms (CGI-S&lt;3) or impairing Adverse Events. Patients will be maintained at 200mg per day during wks 18-20.</description>

    <description>Youth are given instructions in each session that they may stop whenever they want and they do not need to attempt the task unless they so desire. Therapists have been carefully and thoroughly trained in providing reassurance and/or crisis treatments if needed. Therapists also have been trained to contact one of the PIs immediately in the event of a crisis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  meet criteria for a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
             5th Edition (DSM-5) anxiety disorder of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social
             phobia (SOP), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) using the DSM-5 version of the
             Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule -Child and Parent Versions (ADIS-C/P)

          -  receive a mean score of 4 or greater on the ADIS-C/P Clinician Rating Scale of
             Severity (CSR)

          -  cease all other psychosocial treatment upon consultation with the clinic staff and
             the service provider

          -  not currently using any psychotropic medication other than a stable dose of stimulant
             medication treatment for comorbid ADHD. Youth who are on a stable dose of stimulant
             medication (i.e., a minimum of six months at the same dose) will be included so as
             not to limit generalizability.

             active, they must be using an appropriate method of birth control. Of additional note
             is that it is an allowable possibility to include children who have coexisting
             psychiatric diagnoses of lesser severity than the three target disorders including
             attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) while receiving stable doses of
             stimulant, obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress, oppositional defiant, and
             conduct disorders.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  meet for primary diagnosis of any DSM-5 disorder other than GAD, SOP, and SAD

             an IQ subtest score &lt; 6 on either one of these two subtests of the WISC-IV, a full
             scale IQ score (FSIQ) will be obtained. Children with FSIQ &lt; 80 will be excluded

          -  be a victim of past or present  undisclosed abuse requiring investigation or ongoing
             supervision by the Connecticut Department of Children and Families.

          -  have an unstable medical condition or a medical condition that could be worsened by
             selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as a bleeding disorder or an

             sertraline (anticoagulants, triptans for migraine treatment, dextromethorphan)
