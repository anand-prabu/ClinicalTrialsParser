Conventional dose escalation with at least 3 patients per dose level (3 selected dose\n           levels).\n\n        2. Expansion of each dose level to a total of 7 patients for assessment of immune response\n           levels\n\n      13 UV1 vaccinations will be given during the first 6 months (week 26) of treatment, unless\n      clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. GM-CSF (Leukine \u00ae) will be\n      administered locally 10-15 minutes before each UV1 vaccination.\n\n      Hormone na\u00efve patients will receive standard complete androgen blockade by GnRH-agonist (3\n      months depot formulation sc.) and bicalutamide 50 mg orally per day (CAB). Patients already\n      on GnRH-agonist therapy will continue with their initial treatment with addition of\n      bicalutamide 50 mg orally per day."
