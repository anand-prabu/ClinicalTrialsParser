  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial to examine the effects of aftercare for mental health patients in community
      health center (Leistad). Recruitment occurs among hospitalized patients in psychiatric
      hospitals (Ã˜stmarka). After discharge, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups: intervention group (community health center, primary care) or control group
      (Community mental health centers of District Psychiatric Service, specialist care).

      The project's primary objective is to investigate the effect of community services on
      patients' functional capacity and user satisfaction after discharge. Secondly, the number of
      treatment days and readmissions to mental health care will be examined. The project will
      also compare costs of hospitalization, in psychiatric hospital and community health center
      respectively. Data will be collected from community health records, medical records and
      patient systems in psychiatric hospital, community mental health centers of District
      Psychiatric Service (DPS) and questionnaires filled out by patients.
