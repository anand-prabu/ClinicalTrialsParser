To accomplish this, previously well children aged 1-10 years\n      who present to McMaster Children's Hospital (MCH) emergency department (ED) with CAP will,\n      if they consent, be randomly chosen to be given either a 5 day or 10 day course of\n      amoxicillin.  Neither the child, the child's caregiver, nor the researchers will know\n      whether the child is in the 5- or 10-day antibiotic group.  Once the child has received the\n      medication and for two weeks after that, caregivers of children will be asked to complete a\n      daily symptom diary for their child, and will come to MCH at the end of the two week period\n      (between day 14-18) to be assessed by one of the researchers.  This information will then be\n      used to compare both groups of children to determine if a 5 days of treatment is\n      non-inferior to 10 days.  The investigators hypothesize that running such a trial is\n      feasible."
