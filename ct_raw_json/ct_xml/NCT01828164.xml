  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study whether or not the Aevo System™ medical device enhances the rate of tooth movement
      in human subjects who use orthodontic braces.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve comparing the effects of tooth movement with and without ultrasound
      treatment in a split mouth design. Treatment will consist of using the Aevo System™ device
      for one 20 minute period per day for the duration of the trial (up to 24 weeks). Tooth
      position measurements will be taken from eligible patients prior to commencing usage of the
      study device. Follow-up visits will be scheduled for intra-oral clinical measurements and to
      take full-arch impressions. The Aevo System™ consists of an ultrasound emitting mouthpiece
      which is wire connected to an external handheld device. The mouthpiece is placed over the
      teeth and over the braces every day for 20 minutes in order to deliver the therapy.

    <description>The difference in the average monthly (28 day) rate of tooth movement in the treated side as compared to control side of device will be measured. The time to close a minimum 3mm extraction space over the treatment period will be recorded. Small-field-of-view CBCTs of maxillary and mandibular teeth are taken on the canines to assess the canines' root length.  The resolution used will be 0.25mm @ 26.9 sec.
Base-line full dental arch impressions will be taken every 4 weeks, and the dental casts will be produced for measuring tooth position.</description>
