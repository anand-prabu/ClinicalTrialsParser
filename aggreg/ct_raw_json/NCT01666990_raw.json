A chronic generalized immune activation is\n      now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss of anti-HIV-1\n      immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. However, it is still\n      unknown whether reducing immune activation will restore CD4 T cell counts and leading to\n      immune reconstitution in chronic HIV infection. Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) has\n      been demonstrated to decrease immune activation of the host, and can suppress inflammation\n      in human diseases. Here, the investigators propose a hypothesis that TwHF can reduce immune\n      over-activation which subsequently leads to the restoration of CD4 T-cell counts and immune\n      reconstitution in HIV-infected immune non-responders."

            "textblock": "Although HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells that\n      eventually leads to clinically significant immunodeficiency, a chronic generalized immune\n      activation is now being recognized to be the main driving force for T cell depletion, loss\n      of anti-HIV-1 immunity and disease progression during chronic HIV-1 infection. In\n      particular, this immune activation has been identified as a disease determinant independent\n      of viral load or cell death in HIV-1 infection. A series of clinical evidences have\n      indicated that activated CD8 T cells may attack body cells infected with viruses. Because of\n      this, CD4 cells infected with HIV are frequently destroyed by CD8 cells.\n\n      In traditional Chinese medicine, extracts of the roots of the medicinal vine Tripterygium\n      wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) (known in China as \"lei gong teng\" or \"thunder god vine\") have shown\n      therapeutic promise in treating autoimmune and inflammatory conditions as well as cancer. In\n      this extracts, three diterpenoids\u2014triptolide, tripdiolide, and triptonide\u2014are the most\n      abundant and account for the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects observed in\n      both in vitro and in vivo studies. Recently, different extracts of TwHF have been used in\n      Chinese allopathic medicine for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and\n      small controlled trials reported good responses with TwHF extracts in patients with\n      cadaveric kidney transplants and Crohn disease. In particular, a multicenter, double-blind,\n      active comparator trial of a standardized TwHF extract in patients with active rheumatoid\n      arthritis has shown a 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria in\n      patients with TwHF than with sulfasalazine. Thus, TwHF may reduce inflammatory responses and\n      promote tissue recovery in human diseases.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how well TwHF reduces the level of\n      activation of CD8 cells in people infected with HIV. The decreased activation of CD8 cells\n      may lead to a more CD4 T cell restoration and immune reconstitution in HIV infection. This\n      study will also look at how well TwHF is tolerated and its safety in HIV- infected patients.\n\n      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:\n\n      Arm A: Participants will receive 48 weeks of TwHF treatment. Arm B: Participants will\n      receive 48 weeks of placebo Study treatment will be given 20 mg, three times per day for a\n      full 48 weeks. After treatment has started, participants will be asked to come to the clinic\n      on Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48. At each visit participants will receive enough study\n      treatment to last until the next visit. Each visit will last between 2 and 3 hours. At most\n      visits participants will have a physical exam, answer questions about any medications they\n      are taking and how they are feeling, and have blood drawn for safety to assess CD4/CD8 cell\n      counts and viral load. Some additional blood will also be stored for immunology testing. At\n      some visits participants will be asked questions about their medication and medical history,\n      have pupils dilated, have a hearing test, and have an electrocardiogram (EKG). Some visits\n      will require participants to arrive fasting. Pregnancy tests may also be conducted if the\n      participant is able to become pregnant or if pregnancy is suspected."
