  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction is the term used to describe a condition where an unborn
      baby does not reach its optimum size. In the short and long term, intrauterine growth
      restricted babies have a higher risk of serious disease and even death. It is well
      established that very low levels of oxygen in the baby's blood can harm the baby's health
      through a state known as oxidative stress. Currently, there is no established treatment
      available to treat intrauterine growth restriction or its complications. In experimental
      animal studies however, the naturally occuring hormone, melatonin, has been shown to
      significantly reduce oxidative stress and improve health of the unborn babies that have
      suffered from intrauterine growth restriction. This study aims to find out if the use
      melatonin twice per day throughout pregnancies affected by  intrauterine growth restriction
      will lower the level of oxidative stress experienced by the unborn baby. If this is the case
      melatonin may help protect  the unborn baby from damage caused by oxidative stress, this
      will be studied in a separate future study.

    <description>Women with IUGR will take 4mg prolonged release melatonin oral tablets twice daily. Treatment will occur as soon as the diagnosis of intrauterine growth restriction is made and the patient has been enrolled to this study until birth. The overall duration of treatment will vary due to the nature of intrauterine growth restriction.</description>
