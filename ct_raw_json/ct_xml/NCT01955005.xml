      This study aims to conduct a pilot of an intervention to improve care coordination between
      VA and non-VA providers using the Department of Veteran's Affairs' (VA) personal health
      record, My HealtheVet (MHV).  Participants will be randomized to receive either training on
      1) how to use My HealtheVet to share VA health information or 2) training on how to how to
      search the Internet for health information and decide which Internet sites have good quality
      information.  We predict that veterans who receive the My HealtheVet training will have
      fewer medication errors and duplication of services between the VA and outside providers

      This study aims to conduct a pilot of an intervention to improve care coordination between
      VA and non-VA providers using the Department of Veteran's Affairs' (VA) personal health
      record, My HealtheVet (MHV). Background: The Blue Button feature of My HealtheVet allows
      veterans to print out a comprehensive summary of their health that can be shared with non-VA
      providers.  Dual use is common and has been associated with negative health outcomes
      including higher mortality.  Preliminary data collected by the principal investigator in
      collaboration with the My HealtheVet Performance Evaluation workgroup shows that few
      veterans enrolled in My HealtheVet use it to inform either VA or non-VA providers of their
      care.   To remedy this, the principal investigator has developed an online video and
      companion paper-based training.  This training will teach veterans how to use the Blue
      Button feature and why it is important to share the print out with their non-VA provider.
      Methods:  To participate, veterans must have an upcoming non-VA provider appointment, be
      prescribed 5 or more medications, and be registered on My HealtheVet with a premium account.
       Participants will be randomized to receive either training on how to use the Blue Button or
      training on how to search for health information on the Internet and if that information is
      good quality.  Veterans in both arms will receive training materials and phone support.
      After the non-VA provider visit, both the veteran and the provider will be asked to indicate
      what occurred during the visit, including whether or not the veteran gave the provider the
      Blue Button print out.   Both veterans and providers will also be asked to complete a
      15-minute qualitative interview about their experience during the visit.  Medical records of
      the non-VA provider visit will be obtained.   Outcomes: The main outcome for the study is
      whether the patient provided the non-VA provider a copy of his or her health information
      printed from My HealtheVet.  In addition, comparison between the VA and non-VA provider
      records will be conducted to test whether veterans who completed the training had 1) better
      medication reconciliation between the VA and the non-VA provider and 2) fewer instances of
      therapeutic or laboratory duplication.   The results of this pilot will be used to inform a
      larger randomized controlled trial of the training intervention.

    <time_frame>Within 1-2 week of non-VA provider visit</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary outcome is whether or not the veteran brings their VA information from My HealtheVet to their visit with their non-VA provider.  Providers will be asked to complete a form during the appointment where assessment of sharing this information is embedded in a checklist of possible visit activities.  Participants will also if they provided this information to the provider in the event the provider opts to not return the form.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Reconciliation</measure>
    <time_frame>Typically within 1 month of non-VA provider visit</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Medication reconciliation will be calculated by comparing the current VA medication list with the non-VA provider medication list to determine the total number of distinct medications.  The number of distinct medications included on both lists divided by the total number of distinct medications will yield a range of scores between score between 0 and 100, with 100 indicating perfect medication reconciliation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic Duplication</measure>
    <time_frame>Typically within 1 month of non-VA provider visit</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Therapeutic duplication will be defined as concurrent use of more than one medication from the same therapeutic class.  For laboratory duplication, we will review non-VA and VA medical records 6 months prior to the non-VA provider visit.  Each patient will be assigned a dichotomous indicator for whether they received therapeutic duplication and/or laboratory duplication during their non-VA provider visit</description>
