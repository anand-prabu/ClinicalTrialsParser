Intervention through\n      caring contacts (e.g., letters, phone calls) have efficacy showing they may be an important\n      adjunct or alternative to outpatient care. Caring contact interventions have been shown in\n      previous studies to decrease suicidal ideation and behavior and initial pilot data have\n      shown positive results in military populations.\n\n      Text messaging is a low-cost means of sending brief messages (160 characters) to any owner\n      of a mobile phone has been investigated as an intervention for improving attendance to\n      medical appointments and adherence to treatment in medical populations. As our current\n      military population is a young, mobile, and increasingly technologically savvy population,\n      and with the growing support behind text messaging as a feasible and effective mode of\n      behavioral intervention, the pairing of text messaging and caring contact interventions\n      warrants further research.\n\n      The investigators plan to randomize 800 participating service members to one of the two\n      treatment conditions (i.e., CCVT + TAU or to TAU alone) to test the efficacy of this\n      intervention. Measured endpoints will include suicide risk incident requiring medical\n      evacuation or hospitalization, suicidal ideation as identified by the follow-up assessment\n      battery, \"thwarted belongingness\" as identified by The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire,\n      outpatient behavioral health care utilization, and death."
