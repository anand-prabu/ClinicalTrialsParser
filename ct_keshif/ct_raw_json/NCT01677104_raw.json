However little is known about a potential benefit of GLP-1 on\n      the vascular system in humans, independent of their glucose lowering actions and data are\n      only derived from ex vivo studies in animals. Particularly little is known about clinically\n      relevant benefits of GLP-1 and its analogues on the microvascular system of individuals with\n      type 2 diabetes.\n\n      The vascular effect could be medicated by endogenous GLP-1 (9,36) amide, the breakdown\n      product of GLP-1 (7,36) amide which has a low affinity for the GLP-1 receptor. The\n      investigators hypothesis is that the co-administration of DPP-IV inhibitors will lack the\n      beneficial effects of GLP-1 on the vascular system as GLP-1 (9,36) amide will not be\n      produced by the body.\n\n      The study aims to examine the response of GLP-1 and its analogues on small blood vessels\n      and examine the effect of  the addition of DPP-IV inhibition in healthy lean individuals,\n      obese individuals and subjects with Type 2 diabetes."
