            "textblock": "Since 1992, transabdominal LA(laparoscopic adrenalectomy) has been a standard method of\n      adrenalectomy. This traditional method has been used widely because this procedure provides\n      wide view of the whole abdomen which is familiar to surgeons. But due to its unique location\n      at retroperitoneum, adrenal is still not easy to approach. So various retroperitoneal\n      approaches were designed and adjusted. Among those, PRA(posterior retroperitoneal\n      adrenalectomy) has showed good outcomes in many institutes. PRA facilitates direct approach\n      to kidney and adrenal gland, and so operative time can be shortened. But there has been no\n      randomized controlled trial between these two methods.\n\n      Therefore, as experienced surgeons in both methods, we want to practice this study."
