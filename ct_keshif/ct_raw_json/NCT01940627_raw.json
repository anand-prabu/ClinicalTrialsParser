Likewise, a nutritional survey will\n      be realized, with follow-up of 72h, to assure that the all the subjects consume similar\n      diets and these will not interfere with the study. They will be informed about the\n      characteristics of the study and we will get informed consent form them.\n\n      Following the EFSA Guides, the subjects might be considered to be a healthy population in\n      general and inside this category, they are a specific group of physically active subjects,\n      there would be included the normal population and / or amateur sportsman."
