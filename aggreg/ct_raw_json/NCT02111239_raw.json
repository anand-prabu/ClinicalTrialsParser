An operative plan based on perforator size and course will be devised by an\n      interventional radiologist and a plastic surgeon. The DIEP flap procedure will be planned\n      for controls.\n\n      Subjects will not be told if the operative plan is changed intraoperatively. Flap dissection\n      time and changes in operative plan will be recorded intraoperatively and surgeon stress will\n      be evaluated following surgery. Pain and narcotic use will be evaluated preoperatively and\n      on days 1-4 postoperatively. The Breast-Q will be completed preoperatively and at 3 weeks, 3\n      months and 12 months postoperatively. Groups will be compared in terms of all variables\n      measured."
