Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy alone is more effective than radiation\n      therapy plus chemotherapy in treating cancer of the nasopharynx.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well radiation therapy and\n      chemotherapy works compared to radiation therapy alone in treating patients with previously\n      untreated cancer of the nasopharynx."

Concurrent radiotherapy is given once daily 5 times a week over\n           the 7 week treatment period. This chemoradiotherapy is followed 3 weeks later by\n           adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients receive cisplatin IV and fluorouracil IV over 6-8 hours\n           for 4 consecutive days every 4 weeks for 3 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 4 months for the first year, every 6 months for the next 2\n      years, and then annually thereafter until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 200 patients will be accrued for this study."
