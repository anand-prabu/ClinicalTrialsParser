It is not yet known\n      which hormone therapy regimen is most effective for prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of bicalutamide with that\n      of observation followed by bicalutamide plus either goserelin or orchiectomy for patients\n      who have prostate cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, tumor differentiation grade (G3 or Gleason more than 6 vs other\n      values), T category, comorbidity (i.e., chronic disease) (yes vs no), potency (yes vs no),\n      type of chosen hormonal ablation (goserelin vs orchiectomy), PSA level (less than 10 ng/mL\n      vs 10-20 ng/mL vs 20-100 ng/mL), and N status (N0 vs NX). Patients are randomized to one of\n      two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral bicalutamide once daily. At first symptomatic disease\n           progression, patients also receive goserelin subcutaneously once every 28 or 84 days or\n           undergo bilateral orchiectomy. At second disease progression, patients discontinue\n           bicalutamide.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients are observed until first symptomatic disease progression. At first\n           disease progression, patients receive bicalutamide with either goserelin or bilateral\n           orchiectomy as in arm I. Patients discontinue bicalutamide as in arm I.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 6 years, at each disease\n      progression, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1266 patients (633 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 5 years."
