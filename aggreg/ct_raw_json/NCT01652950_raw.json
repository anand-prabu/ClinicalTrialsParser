            "textblock": "Background: Physical inactivity and increased sedentary activity are major lifestyle factors\n      that contribute to increasing burden of disease globally. There is evidence that the rise in\n      prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) was largely responsible for growth in private\n      insurance spending between 1987 and 2002 in the USA. There is renewed interest by health\n      plans to implement incentivized health promotion programs, in an effort to change health\n      behavior and thereby reduce health care costs related to NCDs. However, the literature on\n      the role of incentives and rewards in influencing physical activity behavior, specifically,\n      is relatively sparse, and the field of behavioral economics applied to health behavior is\n      relatively new.\n\n      Most studies that have been conducted typically report findings with limited, well-defined\n      incentives that are offered for a short period. These studies generally have shown a\n      moderation in health care costs compared to non-participants. In a cross-sectional study of\n      approximately 940,000 members of a national private health insurance, Discovery Health, the\n      investigators have previously demonstrated a significant and inverse relationship between\n      levels of participation in fitness-related activities and medical claims associated with\n      hospital admissions. More recently, in a retrospective, longitudinal analysis over 5 yrs,\n      amongst more than 300,000 members, the investigators found that participation in\n      fitness-related activities increased over a 5-yr period and was associated with a\n      significantly lower probability of hospital admissions and inpatient claims costs.\n\n      Aim: The current study primarily aims to prospectively compare the effectiveness of diverse\n      incentives on physical activity behavior, monthly over a 12 month period following\n      registration, in a cohort of newly-enrolled, adult members of the Vitality health promotion\n      program.\n\n      Study sample and random allocation to groups: Newly enrolled adult members of the Discovery\n      Health medical plan and who have, themselves, prospectively registered for the Vitality\n      health promotion program, will be eligible for the study, and will be invited to participate\n      by Discovery Health. This recruitment, enrollment and random allocation to groups will be\n      initiated via a web-based email communication, from Discovery Health, over a period of 5\n      months. A final sample of 9000 adult members will be randomly allocated by Discovery\n      Vitality (with replacement) to one of six study (incentive) groups (n=1500 per group) and\n      followed each month for a period of 12 months.\n\n      The intervention arms include a Control group, in which members will be offered no\n      additional incentives, other than the existing incentives, to engage in all points-earning\n      physical activity. There will also be a Communication Group, in which members will be\n      offered the base program and, in addition, will be sent bi-weekly communications by\n      alternating email and text messaging which included information on the importance of\n      physical activity, tips on accumulating \"fitness points\" on the base program, a status\n      update of points earned and information on benefits and rewards offered.\n\n      The incentive arms are comprised of a Direct Payment Group, a Charity Incentive Group, a\n      Lottery Pay-out Group, and a Choice Group. In each case, members will be offered the base\n      program and supplementary communication described above. In addition, individuals will be\n      offered the equivalent of one of four possible incentive amounts depending on the level of\n      participation in fitness-related activities. Enrollment will be over a period of 5 months,\n      and the intervention will take place over a period of 12 months, following registration,\n      with a monthly pay-out for the incentive arms of the trial.\n\n      The following outcomes of interest will be measured:\n\n        -  Number of new participants (registration) in the fitness programs of Vitality\n\n        -  Points earned, as a proxy for levels of participation, for engaging in physical\n           activity (gym visits)\n\n        -  Self-reported measures of physical activity levels, smoking and healthy eating\n           behaviors\n\n        -  Health care claims (de-personalized) for the 12 month period following the 12 months\n           intervention\n\n        -  Survey of attitudes to incentives and rewards in the post-study questionnaire\n\n      Ethical considerations: Ethics approval has been obtained from the University of Cape Town/\n      University of Pennsylvania Research Ethics committees. Consent will be obtained from each\n      subject, who agree to participate or 'opt out' and agree that their medical claims and\n      utilization data may be examined in a de-personalised manner according to their group, and\n      level of participation. Further, should a member choose to drop out in the course of the\n      study, or refuse to participate, there will be no adverse impact on their medical plan\n      coverage and they are free to withdraw without prejudice at any time during the course of\n      the study."
