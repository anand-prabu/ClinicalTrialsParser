        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the
             head and neck.

          -  Disease must be considered incurable.  Incurable is defined as metastatic disease or
             a local or regional recurrence in a previously irradiated site that is unresectable
             (or patient declines resection).

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥10 mm with CT scan, as ≥20 mm by
             chest x-ray, or ≥10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. (Phase I only: patients
             without measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria but with evaluable disease by
             imaging or physical exam will be eligible as well.)

          -  Phase I only: any (or no) prior therapy for metastatic disease is allowed, including
             cetuximab.  If a patient has not received prior standard therapy, s/he must have been
             offered and refused prior standard therapy.

          -  Phase II only: at least one cycle of prior treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin
             for incurable disease.

          -  Phase II only: at least one line of prior therapy for incurable disease (excluding
             cetuximab).

          -  Phase II only: disease must be determined to be HPV-unrelated.  HPV-unrelated SCCHN
             is defined as either p16-negative OPSCC or non-OPSCC (larynx, hypopharynx, oral
             cavity) or p16-negative unknown primary SCC presenting with a level 2 or 3 neck node.
              p16 will be assessed by IHC; a specimen showing any staining will be considered
             p16-positive.

          -  Minimum of 14 days elapsed since the end of any prior therapy.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 mm3

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000 mm3

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN except in the case of patients with Gilbert's
                  disease

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x IULN for patients without liver metastases and
                  ≤ 5.0 x IULN for patients with liver metastases

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x IULN for patients without bone metastases and ≤ 5.0
                  x IULN for patients with bone metastases

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) &lt; 480 ms.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          -  Available archival tumor tissue for the proposed correlative studies.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed
             consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Phase II only: prior treatment with cetuximab.

          -  Any condition that impairs the ability to swallow PD 0332991 capsules.

          -  Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior anti-cancer therapy or surgical
             procedures to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 Grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia or other toxicities
             not considered a safety risk for the patient at investigator´s discretion)

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Known brain metastases.  Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to PD 0332991, cetuximab, or other agents used in the study.

          -  Treated within the last 7 days prior to Day 1 of protocol therapy with:

               -  Food or drugs that are known to be CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. grapefruit juice,
                  verapamil, ketoconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin,
                  telithromycin, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir,
                  nefazodone, diltiazem, and delavirdine) or inducers (i.e. dexamethasone,
                  glucocorticoids, progesterone, rifampin, phenobarbital, St. John's wort).

               -  Drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval.

               -  Drugs that are proton pump inhibitors.

          -  Uncontrolled electrolyte disorders that can compound the effects of a QTc-prolonging
             drug (e.g., hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study entry.  Female patients must be
             surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraceptive
             during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after completion of
             treatment. The decision of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of
             the principal investigator or a designated associate.

          -  Known HIV-positivity and on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with PD 0332991.  In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
