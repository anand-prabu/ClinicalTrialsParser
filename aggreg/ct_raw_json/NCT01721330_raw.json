Medications that increase dopamine are often effective\n      treatments for ADHD. Since naltrexone is a kappa opioid receptor antagonist, it increases\n      dopamine in the brain. The investigators predict that naltrexone as a monotherapy will be\n      effective for ADHD symptoms in adults with ADHD.\n\n      The investigators also plan to assess the effects of naltrexone on dopamine as measured by\n      changes in serum prolactin. The investigators predict that naltrexone will increase dopamine\n      as indexed by decreases in serum prolactin. This study will be a six-week, double-blind,\n      placebo-controlled pilot study with adults 18-55 years of age with ADHD."

Diagnosis of ADHD, by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) by clinical\n             evaluation by an expert clinician.\n\n          3. A Clinical Global Impression Severity Score (CGI-S)  of 7 (among the most extremely\n             ill patients) at the screening visit is exclusionary.\n\n          4. Subjects treated for anxiety disorders and depression who are on a stable medication\n             regimen for at least one month, and who have a disorder-specific CGI-Severity score \u2264\n             3 (mildly ill) and who have a score on the Hamilton-Depression and Hamilton-Anxiety\n             rating scales below 15 (mild range).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Any clinically unstable psychiatric conditions including any history of psychosis or\n             mania, suicidality, sociopathy, criminality, or delinquency.\n\n          2. Current (last 3 months) substance use disorders (alcohol or drugs),\n\n          3. Medical condition or treatment that will either jeopardize subject safety or affect\n             the scientific merit of the study including cardiovascular disease, current untreated\n             hypertension, history of renal or hepatic impairment, or a condition that will or may\n             require treatment with opioid analgesics.\n\n          4. Clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory Liver Function Tests (LFT's),\n             which is defined as LFT's greater than the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN).\n\n          5. Mental retardation (IQ < 80).\n\n          6. Organic brain disorders including delirium, dementia, seizures, stroke, neurosurgery,\n             and head trauma with loss of consciousness.\n\n          7. Pregnant or nursing females.\n\n          8. Subjects with current adequate treatment for ADHD.\n\n          9. Current treatment with medication for ADHD.\n\n         10. Any other concomitant medication with primarily central nervous system activity other\n             than specified in the protocol (a stable and effective treatment regimen of a\n             Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor [SSRI] or benzodiazepine is permitted per\n             clinical review).\n\n         11. Non-English speaking subjects will not be allowed into the study for the following\n             reasons:\n\n               1. The assessment instruments are unavailable and have not been adequately\n                  standardized in other languages;\n\n               2. Even if such translation services were available, the assessments in the English\n                  language conducted by English-speaking clinicians and raters with\n                  English-speaking subjects are already extremely time-consuming, lasting many\n                  hours, making it unfeasible, unrealistic, and of dubious clinical validity to\n                  conduct them with a translator with non-English-speaking subjects;\n\n               3. Psychiatric questionnaires and evaluations are taxing, and adding the complexity\n                  of a translator has the potential to make the patient experience even more\n                  exhausting."
