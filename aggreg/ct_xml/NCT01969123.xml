             representative before any study-specific procedures for the subject are performed and

          -  Clinical diagnosis of dementia due to probable AD consistent with criteria
             established by a workgroup of the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's
             Disease Association

             contraception if of childbearing potential (defined as consistent use of combined
             effective methods of contraception [including at least 1 barrier method])

             ineligible)
