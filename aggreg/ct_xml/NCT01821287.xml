  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the causes of growth failure and to define
      biochemical markers of nutritional failure in patients with single ventricle Congenital
      Heart Disease (CHD).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) for infants with a single ventricle compared to the age-matched control infants using the analysis of covariance procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months of age</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The following covariates will be considered for inclusion in the model:  cardiac diagnoses, measures of cardiac function, hemodynamic measurements, number of parents, and number of siblings living at home. Transformations of REE (e.g. log or rank) may be conducted to satisfy the assumptions of the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The relationship between REE and weight changes in infants with a single ventricle and control subjects; measures include REE, weight, and z-score (weight for age)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months of age</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Will be estimated by Pearson's correlation coefficient. If the assumption of normality of the two measurements is not reasonable, Spearman's rank correlation will be conducted. To further explore the relationship between REE and weight gain in infants with a single ventricle, partial correlation coefficients will be estimated where the following covariates are considered for inclusion in the model:  cardiac diagnoses, measures of cardiac function, number of parents, and number of siblings living at home.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The relationship between biochemical markers of nutrition (prealbumin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, IL6, IL8, TNF-Î±, cortisol, insulin, and lymphocyte subclasses) and weight changes in infants with a single ventricle</measure>
    <time_frame>at newborn hospitalization (at 1-5 days)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Will be estimated by Pearson's correlation coefficient. If the assumption of normality of the measurements is not reasonable, Spearman's rank correlation will be conducted. To further explore the relationship between biochemical markers of nutrition and weight gain, partial correlation coefficients will be estimated where the following covariates are considered for inclusion in the model:  cardiac diagnoses, measures of cardiac function, number of parents, and number of siblings living at home. Finally, a regression model will be created using weight gain (and weight-for-age Z-scores) as the dependent variable and candidate independent variables including cardiac diagnoses, measures of cardiac function, hemodynamic measurements, REE, number of parents living at home, and number of siblings living at home</description>
