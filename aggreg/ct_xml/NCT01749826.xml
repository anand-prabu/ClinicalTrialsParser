  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PI is interested in learning how the immune system and the inflammation process is
      effected by acute and chronic opioid exposure. Preliminary evidence in animal models show
      that acute opioid exposure leads to decreased inflammatory responses, while chronic opioid
      exposure causes increased inflammatory responses, as measured by local cytokine release at
      the site of injury. Translating these findings to humans will lead to important new
      mechanistic knowledge that may ultimately improve our ability to treat pain.

    <description>The laser doppler is a noninvasive, painless measurement of superficial perfusion that reflects inflammation. Laser doppler images will be taken once per study visit.</description>

    <description>A hand-held 0.6x0.6 inch metal probe will be brought into contact with the patient's skin. Starting at 95 F, the probe temperature will increase at a rate of 1.8 F per second. The patient will be asked to push a button of a hand-held device as soon as the patient feels pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Changes in mechanical pain stimuli will be assessed between measurements taken on Day 1 and Day 30</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Pain sensitivity will be tested with three different mechanical stimuli that can elicit mild pain:
Stroking stimulus: skin will be tested with a brush that is moved three times across the lesion
Punctuated stimulus: a metal rod (1/100 of an inch in diameter) mounted onto 10 different weights (0.03-2.9 ounces) will repetitively be placed onto the skin
Blunt stimulus: a flat probe (0.4 inch in diameter) will be placed five times onto the patient's skin</description>
