The present study aimed to determine the minimum effective volume of 0.375%\n      bupivacaine with epinephrine for interscalene brachial plexus block for shoulder surgery.\n      Following approval by the Research Ethics Committee, patients with a physical condition of I\n      or II according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, between 21 and 65 years old\n      and subjected to elective surgery of the shoulder and interscalene brachial plexus block\n      will be recruited. The volume of the anesthetic will be determined using a step-up/step-down\n      method and based on the outcome of the preceding block. Positive or negative block results\n      in a 1mL reduction or increase in volume, respectively. The success of the block is defined\n      as the presence of motor block in two muscle groups and the absence of thermal and pain\n      sensations in the necessary dermatomes within 30 minutes of the injection. Diaphragmatic\n      paralysis, pulmonary function and analgesia will be quantified at 30 minutes, 4 and 6 hours.\n      Data will undergo statistical analysis in order to determine minimum effective volume of\n      0.375% bupivacaine and, secondarily, the maximum volume that maintains the diaphragmatic\n      function, evaluate diaphragm paralysis and its influence in pulmonary function."
