CRS-207 is a weakened (attenuated) form of Listeria monocytogenes that has\n      been genetically-modified to reduce its capacity to cause disease, while maintaining its\n      ability to stimulate potent immune responses. CRS-207 has been engineered to elicit an\n      immune response against the tumor-associated antigen mesothelin, which has been shown to be\n      present at higher levels on certain tumor cells (such as mesothelioma) than on normal cells.\n      Pemetrexed and cisplatin are the standard chemotherapy regimen to treat malignant pleural\n      mesothelioma. This trial will evaluate whether giving CRS-207 cancer vaccine with\n      chemotherapy will induce anti-tumor immune responses and/or objective tumor response."
