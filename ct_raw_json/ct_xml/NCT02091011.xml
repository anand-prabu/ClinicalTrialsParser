  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to determine the rate and cause of device replacements at 5 years
      post-implantation.  It will assess the battery and device longevity of the Implantable
      Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD) and CRT-D Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator
      (CRT-D) devices.  It will also validate the device survival information given in Boston
      Scientific's Product Performance Report by comparing the pulse generator (PG) survival
      probability in the study to that presented in the Product Performance Reports (PPR)
