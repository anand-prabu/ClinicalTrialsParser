The supplements will be taken in the morning and the\n      last dose will be taken 30 min prior to testing on the last day.  Testing will be performed\n      at baseline and after the 14 days of supplementation.  Ten successive sprints will be\n      conducted on the Wingate apparatus as this has been previously demonstrated to decrease\n      muscle excitability.  After the sprints, muscle excitability, reaction time, and vertical\n      jump power will be measured.  In addition a blood sample will be obtained before and after\n      supplementation and complete blood hematology and chemistry analyses will be performed.  It\n      is expected that ATP supplementation may help maintain muscle excitability and power after\n      the successive sprint sessions."
