Currently, the most widely used VMMC technique in South Africa is open\n      surgical circumcision.\n\n      According to the Framework for Clinical Evaluation of Devices for Adult Male Circumcision\n      (WHO, 2011): \"WHO and other health authorities wish to identify one or more devices that (a)\n      would make the VMMC safer, easier, and quicker; (b) would have more rapid healing than\n      current methods and/or might entail less risk of HIV transmission in the post-operative\n      period; (c) could be performed safely by health-care providers with a minimal level of\n      training; and (d) would be cost-effective compared to standard surgical methods for male\n      circumcision scale up.\"\n\n      This quasi-experimental compares the open surgical technique to an alternative\n      minimally-invasive technique using the disposable Unicirc device with tissue adhesive. The\n      controls come from a separate randomized controlled trial (Unicirc 001) that was conducted\n      just prior to the Unicirc 002 case series of 50 subjects. The investigators postulate that\n      VMMC using the Unicirc device meets WHO criteria for the ideal method to scale up: it is an\n      easier technique to learn and perform, requires less intraoperative time, is safer for both\n      surgeons and patients, heals quicker, and is more cost effective than other currently\n      available techniques. The disposable nature of the device is an immense advantage as it\n      eliminates the need to sterilize and can therefore be used in resource-limited settings. It\n      also reduces the chances of infection caused by contaminated instruments."
