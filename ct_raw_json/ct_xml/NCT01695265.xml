      Using the FEELBREATHE®, a nasal ventilatory restriction device, during an exercise test in
      treadmill, produce physiological changes in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD).

      These changes may improve strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles and improve
      exercise tolerance in these patients.

    <measure>Overall impact of a restriction device ventilatory nasal over different physiological variables in COPD</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects were assessed during 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The investigators measure minute ventilation, peak oxygen uptake (VO2p), peak carbon dioxide production (VCO2p), breathing frequency (BF), ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (CO2 Eq), ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (Eq O2), expiratory tidal volume (Vtexp), inspiratory tidal volume (Vtins), end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2), end-tidal oxygen tension (PETO2), inspiratory time (T.in), ratio of inspiratory duration to total breath duration (ti/t), expiratory time (Tex), oxygen saturation measure by pulse-oximetry SpO2), heart rate (HR), duration of the test and dyspnea and leg fatigue measures by Borg scale. Each subject performed two identical submaximal exercises at 65% of ventilatory threshold under different breathing conditions: 1) nasal breathing with FB and 2) oronasal breathing without FB. Incremental exercise tests were performed on a treadmill ergometer using a one minute step protocol to a symptom-limited maximum.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Oxygen uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects were assessed during 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Before experimental trials each subject performed an incremental protocol on a treadmill ergometer (MONARK, Hamburg, Germany) for the determination of gas exchange. The test was stopped upon volitional fatigue of the subject. Gas-exchange data were measured breath by breath using an Oxycon cardiopulmonary exercise system (Jaeger, Hoechberg, Germany).</description>

    <measure>Maximum static inspiratory pressure (PImax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects were assessed during 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Inspiratory muscle testing was performed using a mouth pressure meter (Micro Medical Inc., Chatham, Kent, UK). The manufacturer states that the test-retest reliability of this device is ±3%. PImax was measured at residual volume and the best result from three inspiratory attempts was taken. Al least one minute was allowed between attempts to minimize the effects of muscle fatigue.</description>

    <description>15 patients diagnosed of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) at least 6 months before, with a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) between 70 and 30% of predicted value. Subjects who provide informed consent and meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized.
The investigators excluded patients who have had an exacerbation in the two months prior to inclusion, patients with concomitant diseases that may cause or contribute to dyspnea on exertion (cardiovascular, metabolic or other respiratory diseases associated) or diseases that could interfere the performance of the exercise test (basically neuromuscular and skeletal diseases).</description>

    <intervention_name>Feel Breathe, restriction device ventilatory nasal in COPD</intervention_name>
    <description>Device: Feel Breathe, restriction device ventilatory nasal The Feel Breathe (FB) consisted of a small adhesive strip that is place  across the bridge of the nose during exercise. The FB was place following procedures for placement as indicated by the manufacture's directions, while the placebo nasal, was placed over the nostrils of the subject, without interfering nasal breathing; thus, nasal airflow resistance was not increase. Each subjet was required to perform three identical submaximal exercises with intensity at 65% of VO2 Peak achieve during a first incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test CPET</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients diagnosed of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) at least 6 months
        before, with a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) between 70 and 30% of
        predicted value

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Suffer other illness.

          -  Unwillingness to complete the study requirements.

          -  Cardiovascular diseases (resting electrocardiogram and during exercise).

          -  Elevated resting blood pressure (&gt;130/85 mmHg). All inclusion and exclusion criteria
             were assessed by a detailed medical history and, where noted, by specific
