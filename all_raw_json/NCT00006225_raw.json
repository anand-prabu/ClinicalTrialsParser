Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 durations of CD34+\n      culture times (6 days vs 9 days).\n\n      After an initial harvest of filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized autologous peripheral blood stem\n      cells (PBSC) for transplantation, patients receive one additional dose of G-CSF and undergo\n      one additional apheresis. The CD34+ cells are cultured in the presence of recombinant human\n      thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, and flt3 ligand to expand megakaryocytes. Patients then\n      undergo treatment with high-dose chemotherapy (and, in some cases, total body irradiation)\n      followed by reinfusion of the conventional PBSC harvest and the ex vivo expanded\n      megakaryocytes.\n\n      Patients are followed until blood counts recover.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
