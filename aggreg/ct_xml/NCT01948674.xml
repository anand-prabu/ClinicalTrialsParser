  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if computer tasks that challenge the brain (cognitively
      stimulating tasks) can improve memory and other types of thinking in adolescents and young
      adults who are being treated for substance use problems. The study will compare the effects
      of different versions of the computer tasks.
