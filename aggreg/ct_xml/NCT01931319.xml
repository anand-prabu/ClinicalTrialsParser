    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine safety and characterize pharmacokinetics of
      higher doses of intravenous baclofen in healthy subjects.

      This study is a non-randomized dose escalation study.  Three subjects will receive 10 mg
      doses of IV baclofen, two or more days later the next three subjects will receive 15 mg
      baclofen intravenously, and two or more days later the last three subjects will receive 20
      mg IV baclofen.

      The pharmacokinetic and tolerability information gained from this study will support the
      development of further studies to assess the use of IV baclofen to prevent or treat baclofen
      withdrawal syndrome.

    <description>Blood Pressure &amp; Pulse:  Recorded every 5 minutes immediately prior to, and during the IV infusion, then every 15 minutes for 1 hour, then every hour for 12 hours.
Assessment of sedation / sleepiness: Subjects will be assessed by using the sleepiness scale prior to drug administration then every 30 minutes for four hours after drug administration.
Ataxia and nystagmus: Measured using the following rating scale and definitions of ataxia and nystagmus.
0=none, 1=mild, 2=severe
Ataxia: For those who are ambulatory, this will be assessed by gait.  Ratings will be:
mild-unsteady with tandem gait testing, but able to perform without assistance severe-unable to perform gait testing without assistance. For non-ambulatory subjects, ataxia will be assessed by finger to nose and finger pursuit maneuvers.
Nystagmus:
mild-present on extreme gaze; severe-present on midline gaze</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females between the ages of 18-65.

          2. Subjects are capable of giving informed consent.

          3. Female subjects must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically incapable
             of bearing children, or practicing at least one or more of the following methods of
             contraception for three months prior to, and during the study: hormonal, intrauterine
             device (IUD), or barrier method in combination with a spermicide.

          4. Subject should be medication free, other than hormonal birth control, for 48 hours
             before through 24 hours after study drug administration. If the need for medication
             is identified during this time period, it will be discussed with and approved by the
             PI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant.

          2. Women who are breastfeeding.

          3. Subject has a history of intolerance to IV administration of medication.

          4. Subject has a known hypersensitivity to baclofen.

          5. Subject has a significant history of cardiac, neurologic, psychiatric, oncologic,
             endocrine, metabolic, renal or hepatic disease

          6. Subject has taken or used any investigational drug or device in the 30 days prior to
             screening.

          7. Subject has taken either prescribed or over the counter medication for 48 hours prior
             to baclofen administration on either of the study days, other than hormonal birth
             control.

          8. Subject reveals clinically significant abnormalities on screening laboratory tests.

          9. Subject is a non-English speaker, such that ability to ascertain neurological status
             would require an interpreter.

         10. Sleep deprivation (for example. working the night shift the evening prior to the
             study).
