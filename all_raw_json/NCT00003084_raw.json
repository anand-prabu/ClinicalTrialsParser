Determine the clinical benefit of two combination chemotherapy regimens,\n      paclitaxel, etoposide, and estramustine vs ketoconazole, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and\n      estramustine in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer, as measured by prostate\n      specific antigen (PSA)-based response rate, time to progression, and overall survival. II.\n      Identify the most promising regimen to use in a phase III trial based on toxic effects,\n      PSA-based response rates, and clinical benefit.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk\n      group: low volume disease (no more than 2 lesions on bone scan), intermediate volume (more\n      than 2 bone lesions confined to axial skeleton), or high volume (bone lesions in\n      appendicular skeletal or visceral lesions). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment\n      arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral estramustine three times a day and oral etoposide twice\n      daily on days 1-14 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days.\n      Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on days 1, 15, and 29, vinblastine IV on days 8, 22,\n      and 36, oral ketoconazole three times a day on days 1-7, 15-21, and 29-35, and oral\n      estramustine three times a day on days 8-14, 22-28, and 36-42. This regimen consists of 6\n      weeks of alternating chemotherapy and 2 weeks rest, for an 8 week course. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients (46 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
