            "textblock": "This is an open label clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of\n      Sci-B-Vac Hepatitis B Vaccine compared to Engerix-B  Hepatitis B Vaccine in dialysis\n      patients.  The study hypothesis is that vaccination with Sci B Vac will achieve a higher\n      seroprotection rate and a higher anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody serum titer level than\n      vaccination with Engerix-B Dialysis patients will be categorized as \"na\u00efve\" or \"previously\n      vaccinated\" and each group will be randomized to treatment.  Na\u00efve patients randomized to\n      Sci-B-Vac Hepatitis B vaccine will receive vaccination in three doses, 10 \u03bcg  each, at 0, 1,\n      and 6 months, or Engerix-B Hepatitis B vaccine given in four doses, 40 \u03bcg each, at 0, 1, 2,\n      and 6 months.  Previously vaccinated patients randomized to Sci-B-Vac Hepatitis B vaccine\n      will receive vaccination in three doses, 20 \u03bcg  each, at 0, 1, and 6 months, or Engerix-B\n      Hepatitis B vaccine given in four doses, 40 \u03bcg each, at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months.  All vaccines\n      will be administered via intra-muscular injection to the deltoid muscle.  The study will\n      consist of three periods: a screening period of up to four weeks, a 24-week open-label\n      treatment period, and a 24-week safety follow-up period.  The total expected duration of the\n      study per subject is 52 weeks as follows: Screening period: approximately 4 weeks; treatment\n      period: 24 weeks; and follow up period: 24 weeks.  The primary endpoint is the by-vaccine\n      difference in the proportion of subjects attaining seroprotective immune response\n      (anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody \u2265 10 IU/mL) 4 weeks after the last vaccination with\n      either Sci-B-Vac or  Engerix-B.  Secondary endpoints include anti-Hepatitis B surface\n      antibody geometric mean concentrations calculated for all subjects upon last active dose;\n      the proportion of subjects with anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody concentrations equal to or\n      above 10 IU/mL for all subjects at 12 weeks following the first vaccine dose; the\n      by-treatment difference in serum titer levels of anti-Hepatitis B surface antibodies at 12,\n      24 and 52 weeks following the first vaccination.  A by-vaccine comparison of adverse events\n      will also be performed."
