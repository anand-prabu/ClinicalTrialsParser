  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In low oxygen environments, such as altitude, some adults may become ill and suffer from
      acute mountain sickness.  Further, all adults will find that exercising becomes much more
      difficult when compared with exercise at lower altitudes (e.g. sea-level).  The purpose of
      this investigation is to study the effects of two drugs that may help people adjust to
      high-altitude quickly, prevent them from becoming ill and improve their exercise
      performance.  The drugs are Methazolamide and Aminophylline.

    <description>After exercising on a stationary cycle ergometer for 30 minutes at a resistance of 100W, research participants will complete an exercise time trial.  The time taken to cycle a distance equivalent to 7.75 miles will be recorded.  On a separate day the experiment will be repeated in hypoxia.  It is expected that the time taken to cycle a distance equivalent to 7.75 miles will be longer in hypoxia compared to normoxia.  One of the goals of this research is to determine if the hypoxia-mediated performance decrement can be decreased with one of our pharmacological interventions.</description>
