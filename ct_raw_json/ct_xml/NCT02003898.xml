      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Threshold Suspend (TS) feature of the Medtronic
      MiniMed® 530G insulin pump in patients 16 and older with insulin requiring diabetes.

      This Post Approval Study is a longitudinal, multi-center trial. Up to 1,200 subjects will be
      enrolled in investigational centers across the United States. Subjects will attend 5 study
      visits over a period of one year.

      The study objective is to demonstrate that home use of Threshold Suspend (TS) is not
      associated with glycemic deterioration, as measured by change in A1C.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is age 16 or older at time of screening

          2. Two separate Hemoglobin A1C tests should be documented for each subject within 6
             months of Screening. The A1C tests should meet the following criteria:

               -  They should have been taken a minimum of 90 days apart while on sensor augmented
                  pump therapy

               -  They should not differ by more than an absolute value of 0.5% (e.g. 7% vs. 7.5%,
                  9% vs. 9.5%)

               -  They should be verifiable via source documentation

               -  They should have been run by the same method/assay which may include Point of
                  Care or local laboratory measurements. The assay should be NGSP (National
                  Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program) certified. For example: Both A1Cs
                  should have been measured by the same model POC (point-of-care) machine or both
                  tests should have been processed in the same lab.

          3. Subject has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and has been treated with combined
             basal/bolus insulin therapy for at least one year prior to screening. Two examples of
             combined basal/bolus insulin therapy:

               -  Insulin pump therapy

               -  Insulin injection with use of long acting insulin analog such as glargine or
                  detemir with rapid acting analog such as aspart, lispro and glulisine

          4. Subject is on sensor-augmented pump therapy for at least 91 days prior to screening.
             CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) use will be defined as having worn CGM for at
             least 60% of the time in the last 3 months (Criteria for CGM use will be validated by
             subject report and by pump upload which shows the subject wearing the sensor at least
             60% of the time in the last 2 weeks prior to screening).

          5. Subject is currently transitioning from SAP (Sensor Augmented Pump) to SAP using the
             530G (Model identifier) insulin pump with TS (Threshold Suspend) feature

          6. Subject is willing to perform greater than or equal to 4 finger stick blood glucose
             measurements daily

          7. Subject is willing to perform required sensor calibrations

          8. Subject is willing to wear the system (Pump, sensors, meter) continuously throughout
             the study

          9. Subject is willing to upload data every 21 days from the study pump

         10. Subject must have Internet access and access to a computer system that meets the
             requirements for uploading the pumps. This may include use of family or friend's
             computer system with Internet access.

         11. Subject is able (by insurance or financial means) to cover the initial investment and
             ongoing cost of the 530G insulin pump and consumables, CGM, BG (Blood Glucose) meter
             and supplies for 1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device)
             wherein he/she has received treatment from an investigational study drug or
             investigational study devices in the last 2 weeks.

          2. Women of child-bearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test at screening or
             plan to become pregnant during the course of the study

          3. Subject is being treated for hyperthyroidism at time of screening

          4. Subject has an abnormality (&gt;1.8mg/dL) in creatinine at time of screening visit

          5. Subject has an abnormality (out of reference range) in thyroid-stimulating hormone
             (TSH) at time of screening visit

          6. If TSH is out of range, Free T3 and Free T4 will be tested

          7. Subject may be included with TSH out of range as long as Free T3 and Free T4 are in
             normal reference range.

          8. Subject has taken any oral, injectable, or IV steroids within 8 weeks from time of
             screening visit, or plans to take any oral, injectable, or IV steroids during the
             course of the study

          9. Subject is currently abusing illicit drugs

         10. Subject is currently abusing prescription drugs

         11. Subject is currently abusing alcohol

         12. Subject has a sickle cell disease, hemoglobinopathy; or has received red blood cell
             transfusion or erythropoietin within 3 months prior to time of screening

         13. Subject plans to receive red blood cell transfusion or erythropoietin over the course
             of study participation

         14. Subject diagnosed with current eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia

         15. Subject has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease that results in chronic anemia

         16. Subject is on dialysis
