People at highest risk from progressive CKD are\n      defined by a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and/or the\n      presence of significant albuminuria/proteinuria. Accurate mapping of the bio-clinical\n      determinants of this group will enable improved risk stratification and direct the\n      development of better targeted management for people with CKD. To address these requirements\n      we have established the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) study; RIISC is enrolling\n      a cohort of patients at high risk from progressive CKD and compiling a comprehensive and\n      detailed bio-clinical phenotype, including vascular and oral health phenotyping, at\n      enrolment and on subsequent follow-up."
