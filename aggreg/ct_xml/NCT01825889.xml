  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of the study drug, evacetrapib, gets into
      the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given to participants
      with severe renal (kidney) impairment compared to participants with normal renal (kidney)
      function. This study will last approximately 8 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female participants are not of child-bearing potential

          -  Have a body mass index of 18 to 40 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2)

          -  Participants with normal renal function - healthy as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, and other screening procedures, with normal renal function
             (assessed by estimated creatinine clearance [CLcr] greater than or equal to 90
             milliliter  per minute [mL/min] at screening)

          -  Participants with severe renal impairment - estimated CLcr less than 30 mL/min at
             screening and are not undergoing hemodialysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history or presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, or neurological disorders capable of
             significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs; of
             constituting a risk when taking the study medication; or of interfering with the
             interpretation of data.

          -  Participants who are unwilling to comply with the dietary requirements/restrictions
             during the study

          -  Hemoglobin less than 9 grams/deciliter (g/dL) or significant active hematological
             disease from causes other than underlying renal disease
