  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate whether repeating a screening Molecular Breast
      Imaging (MBI) study two years after an initial screening MBI study further improves breast
      cancer detection in women with dense breast tissue.

          3. Are physically unable to sit upright and still for 40 minutes

          4. Have self-reported signs or symptoms that may suggest breast cancer (palpable mass,
             bloody nipple discharge, axillary mass, etc.)

          5. Have had needle biopsy within 3 months, or breast surgery or radiation within 1 year
             prior to the study
