Voluntary participants will complete three phases: baseline,\n      intervention, and post-treatment. Baseline phase includes a preliminary phone screening,\n      fasting blood draw, physiological test (measuring heart rate variability, chest compression,\n      etc.), and a psychosocial inventory. Intervention phase includes 8 weeks of once weekly\n      trainings (approximately one hour long) to be held on a weekday evening. Participants will\n      be randomly assigned to one of the two willpower groups and will be asked to rehearse the\n      willpower method at least once daily for 30 minutes during these 8 weeks. Post-treatment\n      phase includes two follow-up booster sessions (at week 12 and week 16) for refreshing\n      willpower techniques, a follow-up fasting blood draw, a physiological test, and a\n      psychosocial inventory.\n\n      Participation is completely voluntary and confidential. Volunteers completing each of the\n      phases will be compensated $100 for their time. If someone is interested in participating,\n      they should call our office at 850-645-0247 or email fsuwillpower@gmail.com."
