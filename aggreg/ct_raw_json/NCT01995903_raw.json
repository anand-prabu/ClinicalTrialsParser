Advanced neuroimaging techniques offer great potential in\n      identifying central nervous system metabolite and cellular alterations in ALS. We propose an\n      innovative approach to combine complementary advanced MRI techniques to interrogate brain\n      chemistry (MRS), brain microstructure (DTI) and brain function (fcMRI) and develop a\n      clinically relevant discriminatory disease model."
