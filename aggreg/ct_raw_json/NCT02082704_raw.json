Each game would consist of 2 questions per week x 25 weeks = 50\n      questions total per arm.  The questions are delivered via email by the Qstream platform to\n      the participants.  Upon clicking on a hyperlink in the email, participants select an answer\n      that is downloaded to a server.  They are then provided with the answer to and explanation\n      of the question, along with additional educational materials.  Using an adaptive\n      methodology, the spacing and content of the game material will be individualized for each\n      clinician based on their performance.   Home-based testing of HbA1c and M/C ratio will be\n      conducted by patients at enrollment, 6 months and 12 months.  If successful, this SE game\n      will improve diabetes management among VA patients and improve patient outcomes. Given the\n      growing use of email and the Internet by patients, SE games could be easily expanded to a\n      broad audience of VA patients with varying health problems across the country.  With content\n      tailored to meet specific needs, SE games can be utilized as tools to improve patients'\n      clinical outcomes by bolstering their health management behaviors."

Based upon two psychology research findings (the spacing and testing effects), SE has been shown in randomized trials to improves knowledge acquisition, boosts learning retention for up to two years, and durably improves clinical behavior. SE is delivered using periodic emails that contain clinical case scenarios with multiple-choice questions.  Upon submitting an answer, the participant is presented with the correct answer and an explanation of the topic.  The material is then re-presented in a cycled pattern to reinforce the content.  Investigators introduced several game mechanics to turn SE into a game, including competition among participants, adaptive content reinforcement based on performance, and a progression dynamic (progress is displayed and measured by completing itemized tasks).",
