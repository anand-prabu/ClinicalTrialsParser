  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problems with attention are a common and debilitating consequence of brain injury. Studies
      show that poor attention is the number one predictor of poor cognitive functioning one year
      post-injury. This is due to the fact that attention is a necessary component of more complex
      cognitive functions such as learning &amp; memory, multi-tasking and problem solving. In many
      cases, individuals may exhibit problems with spatial attention known as 'hemi-spatial
      neglect syndrome' or simply 'neglect'. Many studies now show that the processing machinery
      of the brain is plastic and remodeled throughout life by learning and experience, enabling
      the strengthening of cognitive skills or abilities. Research has shown that brief, daily
      computerized cognitive training that is sufficiently challenging, goal-directed and adaptive
      enables intact brain structures to restore balance in attention and compensate for
      disruptions in cognitive functioning. The study aims to understand how our computer program
      can affect cognition and attention in those with acquired brain injury.

      Following consent, participants will engage in an assessment process to determine
      eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be scheduled for another
      assessment session to determine current level of cognitive function. This process consists
      of paper-pencil surveys and computerized tests. Following the assessment process,
      participants will engage in an Internet browser-delivered training sessions conducted on any
      internet-accessible computer. The computerized training sessions can be done up to 7 times a
      week (once a day) or at participant's convenience (we recommend 5 times a week). Following
      the completion of training, the participant's cognitive function will be re-assessed.
      Participation is voluntary and participants may withdraw from the study at any time.
