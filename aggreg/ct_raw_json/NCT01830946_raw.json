            "textblock": "Obesity is recognized as a major public health concern because of its link to potential\n      fatal complications arising from metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Despite many\n      pharmacological advances in this field, lifestyle strategies that emphasize proper nutrient\n      intake and physical activity continue to be the primary strategy for individuals to fight\n      obesity. However, controversy exists regarding the type and timing of exercise and specific\n      nutrient intake to maximize fat loss, muscle gain, and beneficial cardio-metabolic\n      adaptations derived from these lifestyle interventions. Furthermore, limited data exists\n      investigating the impact of nutrient timing at times other than immediately before or after\n      exercise and no studies have examined time-of-day nutritional intake in overweight or obese\n      individuals.In addition, many individuals attempting to improve body composition and\n      cardio-metabolic health are concerned with what food choices are appropriate in the late\n      evening to support positive physiological adaptations. However, research-based information\n      examining this topic is scarce.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that consumption of a protein beverage in the late evening\n      before sleep will improve body composition, cardio-metabolic health, and adaptations to\n      exercise more than an isocaloric placebo beverage. The investigators also hypothesize that\n      the different digestion and absorption kinetics of whey and casein proteins will elicit\n      different effects on the measures variables."

Specifically, we\n      will be measuring heart rate, blood pressure, body composition, resting metabolism, maximal\n      strength,cardiovascular function, hormones levels, blood lipid profile, appetite, mood\n      state, and dietary intake. Specific aims of the study are:\n\n      To determine if acute ingestion of a liquid ready-to-drink protein supplement (30g whey or\n      casein protein per serving) consumed in the late evening before sleep will alter the\n      physiological milieu to favor anabolism and alter lipolysis and fat oxidation more than the\n      carbohydrate placebo (34g of maltodextrin per serving).\n\n      To determine if 4 weeks of daily protein supplementation (same supplement as above) in the\n      late evening along with 3 days of exercise training per week will improve body composition,\n      blood lipid profile, strength, cardiovascular risk profile more than a placebo beverage."

All exercises and sets were separated by 90-120 sec of rest. HIIT training was completed on commerical cardiovascular equipment and requires subjects to rate their perceived exertion on a scale from 1 to 10 (1= resting quietly, 5= a warm-up level, 10= an all-out exertion). Subjects warmed-up for 2 min at level 5 and increased their exertion each min for 3 min until level 9 is perceived and then recover at level 6 for 1 min. This pattern was repeated 4 times, where the 4th cycle subjects increased their last min of exertion to level 10, followed by 1-min recovery at the initial warm-up level 5.",
