II. Determine the toxicity of\n      this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the level of DNA topoisomerase I mRNA and\n      protein, as well as SN-38 induced topoisomerase I-DNA complex formation, with the clinical\n      response and toxicity in these patients. IV. Determine if a down regulation of topoisomerase\n      I or altered subcellular distribution of this enzyme is involved in the drug resistance to\n      irinotecan.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment\n      repeats every 6 weeks for 2-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
