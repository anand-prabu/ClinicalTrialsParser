            "textblock": "This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-dose study\n      in adult chinese participants with cancer. The study will consist of a screening phase\n      (within 21 to 1 days before admission to the research facility on Day -1) followed by a\n      4-day open-label treatment phase (Day -1 to Day 3). Participants will remain confined to the\n      study center from Day -1 until completion of the end-of-study visit or withdrawal\n      assessments, which will be done upon completion of the 48-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on\n      Day 3, or upon early withdrawal. The total study duration will be approximately 24 days. All\n      participants will undergo a naloxone challenge test (at a subcutaneous [under the skin] dose\n      of 0.8 milligram [mg]) for opioid dependency during the screening phase. Only those\n      participants who pass this challenge test will be allowed to continue in the study. During\n      the treatment phase, upon completion of a 10-hour overnight fast, participants will receive\n      a single oral (having to do with the mouth) 8 mg dose of hydromorphone in the morning of Day\n      1. Serial blood samples will be collected immediately before and through 48 hours after\n      dosing for the determination of plasma  hydromorphone concentrations. Participants will be\n      administered naltrexone 50 mg, to block the opioid effects of hydromorphone, 14 hours\n      before, 2 hours before, and 10 hours after study drug administration. After the 10-hour\n      dose, additional doses of naltrexone will be administered every 12 hours up to 34 hours\n      postdose. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study."
