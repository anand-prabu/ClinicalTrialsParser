            "textblock": "Alcoholic liver disease is the most frequent complication of excessive alcohol consumption.\n      Early diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease is essential to avoid its complications that\n      could be fatal. To date, the reference diagnostic tool is an invasive procedure: the liver\n      biopsy. The transient elastography is a useful tool for early diagnosis of liver fibrosis.\n      This tool is validated in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis due to C chronic hepatitis.\n      Because it is non-invasive, fast, given immediate results; transient elastography could be\n      repeated in alcoholic patients for liver fibrosis follow-up. In the present study, the\n      investigators propose to realize liver biopsy and transient elastography in 300 alcoholic\n      patients in weaning to evaluate the transient elastography accuracy in the exclusion of\n      sever liver fibrosis (Metavir 3 and 4). The reference liver fibrosis diagnosis tool will be\n      the liver biopsy."
