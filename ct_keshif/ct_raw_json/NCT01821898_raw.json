As a result, the esophagus becomes swollen and blocked making it difficult to\n      swallow, and this leads to heartburn. In severe cases it can lead to food getting stuck in\n      the esophagus and poor growth or weight loss in children\n\n      The main purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of two different\n      types of treatment for EoE:\n\n        1. Oral viscous budesonide- which is a steroid medication that has been used to treat\n           asthma. Recently, it has been used as a therapy to treat the eosinophilic inflammation\n           in EoE, and\n\n        2. Specific food elimination.\n\n      The study will also be looking to see if a blood test is useful in following the progression\n      of EoE. Currently the only way to follow EoE is by repeating endoscopy, which is a more\n      \"invasive test.\""

It will produce comparable groups, and eliminate the source of bias in\n      treatment assignments.\n\n      A total of 120 participants will be recruited for this study consisting of 60 patients\n      positive for food allergens and 60 patients negative for food allergens. Study participants\n      will be randomly assigned to treatments as described below, and the duration of each\n      treatment phase will be 8 weeks.\n\n      I. The subjects who are positive for food allergens will be randomized to group A and B.\n\n      Group A will receive oral viscous budesonide at a dose of 1 mg daily or 2 mg daily depending\n      on the height, and a sham elimination diet (elimination of some foods the subject is not\n      allergic to). For the \"sham\" diet the study team will randomly pick 2-4 foods, no more than\n      5 foods that were negative on patch testing. The sham diet should not contain any of the\n      positive foods.\n\n      Group B will receive an elimination diet (elimination of the foods the subject is allergic\n      to) and a sham dose of budesonide. Sham budenoside is a placebo and will not contain any\n      active medication.\n\n      II. The subjects who were negative for food allergens will be randomized into groups C and D\n\n      Group C will be treated with 6 food elimination diet. It is a dietary therapy consisting of\n      elimination of milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanut/tree nuts and fish/shellfish. These are the\n      most common food allergies.\n\n      Group D will be treated with oral viscous budesonide at a dose of 1 mg daily or 2 mg daily\n      depending on the height."
