Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Combining thalidomide with chemotherapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining thalidomide and\n      cyclophosphamide in treating children who have recurrent or refractory childhood cancers."

Determine the efficacy and toxic effects of thalidomide and cyclophosphamide\n      in patients with recurrent or refractory pediatric malignancies.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide 4 times daily. Cyclophosphamide is administered\n      IV over 1 hour once every 4 weeks, beginning on the same day as thalidomide. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor response is\n      assessed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-80 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
