Both FDCs will be of the same strength: 2 tablets of 150mg\n      CANA/500mg MET XR and will be compared with the equal doses of the individual drugs:\n      canagliflozin (1 x 300mg tablet) and metformin XR (2 x 500mg tablets). Thus, there will be 3\n      treatment periods in the study: Treatment A: \"Reference\" treatment of individual components.\n      Treatment B: CANA/MET XR FDC, formulation 1; and Treatment C: CANA/MET XR FDC, formulation\n      2. Approximately 42 healthy adult participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3\n      treatments groups, and then each group will receive all three treatments in different\n      sequences (3-way crossover). The study will consist of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of\n      approximately 3 weeks (Days -22 to -2), an Open-Label Treatment Phase consisting of 3\n      single-dose Treatment Periods of 5 days each (Days -1 through 4) separated by a washout of\n      10 to 14 days between Day 1 of each Treatment Period, and a Follow-up Phase occurring 7 to\n      10 days after the last study-related procedure on Day 4 of Treatment Period 3. The total\n      duration of the study will be about 70 days for each participant."
