These include polycythemia\n      vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis.\n\n      Portal vein thrombosis and portal hypertension are serious complications that are often seen\n      in myeloproliferative patients. These complications are usually diagnosed when patients\n      become symptomatic, and are often already at an advanced stage. They can further progress to\n      cause non-reversible damage to the liver, also called cirrhosis of the liver. As a result of\n      this, patients often accumulate fluid in the abdomen which is ascites; and can develop\n      swelling of veins in the lining of the esophagus known as varices. If untreated, varices\n      have the risk of rupturing resulting in life-threatening bleeding. When diagnosed at an\n      advanced stage, the treatment is usually supportive therapy and there are no treatments\n      available at present which can reverse these conditions.\n\n      This study is looking at screening for these two conditions using Doppler ultrasound and\n      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy."
