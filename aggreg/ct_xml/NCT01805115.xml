      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of oral, sublingual, vaginal, and no
      misoprostol prior to operative hysteroscopy in  premenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The route of administration of misoprostol for cervical dilatation prior to operative
      hysteroscopy can be oral, vaginal, or sublingual. However, it is still unclear which route
      is more effective and less harmful for cervical dilation prior to operative hysteroscopy in
      premenopausal women. Furthermore, there have been no studies comparing among oral,
      sublingual, and vaginal misoprostol, no medication (control) in these women. The objective
      of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral, sublingual, vaginal, and no
      misoprostol prior to operative hysteroscopy in premenopausal women.

    <description>The primary outcome measure was the preoperative cervical width at the time of operation. The cervical width was assessed by performing cervical dilation, starting with a number 10 Hegar dilator and subsequently inserting smaller Hegar dilators until dilator could pass through the internal os without resistance. The largest one that could be passed was recorded as the initial cervical width.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Symptomatic patients that were suspected as having intrauterine pathology, such as
        submucosal myoma, endometrial polyp or other endometrial pathological findings based on
        the transvaginal ultrasound, were enrolled.

        Inclusion criteria were as follows: women who were of reproductive age (i.e., were
        premenopausal) and were not pregnant at the time of presentation (i.e., negative for urine
        pregnancy test or last menstrual period within the last 4 weeks).   -

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria included any evidence of a contraindication to prostaglandins (history
        of severe asthma, glaucoma, preexisting severe cardiac disease, or renal failure), or
        allergy to prostaglandins, any sign of genital infection, presence of significant
        uterovaginal prolapse that could affect administration of vaginal tablets, history of
        cervical surgery, presence of space occupying lesions in endocervical canal, and treatment
        of GnRH agonist.
