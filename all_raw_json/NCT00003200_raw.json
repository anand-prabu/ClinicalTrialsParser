Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in\n      treating patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of weekly docetaxel when administered as\n      concurrent therapy with radiation therapy after treatment with induction chemotherapy in\n      patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Determine the toxicity\n      profile of this regimen in these patients. III. Obtain preliminary assessment of the\n      efficacy of this regimen in these patients. IV. Study potential predictors of tumor\n      resistance prospectively through tumor biopsies and tissues.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients are administered 1 hour IV infusions of\n      docetaxel weekly for 6 weeks concurrently with radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.\n      Patients are treated in cohorts of 3-5 patients per dose. An entire cohort must complete\n      treatment at a given dose level before a new cohort is accrued at a higher dose. The maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is the dose level below that at which dose limiting toxicity occurs in\n      2 of 5 patients. At the MTD, 15 additional patients are treated to assess for toxicity.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 35 patients is accrued into this study."
