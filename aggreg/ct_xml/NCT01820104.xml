  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral hypoglycemic medications sometimes do not control type 2 diabetes well. Proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs) as adjunctive therapy might improve diabetes control and could enhance the
      hypoglycemic activity of DPP4, but there is little clinical data on efficacy of this
      therapeutic strategy. The investigators sought to examine the effect of PPI lansoprazole,
      DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, and their combination therapy on insulin and glucose regulation
      in healthy subjects in oral glucose tolerance (OGTT).
