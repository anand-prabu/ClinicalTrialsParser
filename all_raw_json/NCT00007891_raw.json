Peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation or bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were\n      destroyed by monoclonal antibody therapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody\n      therapy followed by bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients\n      who have metastatic breast cancer."

Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or peripheral\n      blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV\n      beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 huMOAB BrE-3 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3-4 months for 1 year and then at least annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
