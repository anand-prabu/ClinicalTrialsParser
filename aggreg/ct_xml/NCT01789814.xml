  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early stent thrombosis has been noted with increased frequency in acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who are treated with
      bivalirudin and clopidogrel. The brief half life of bivalirudin acting in concert with the
      delayed action of clopidogrel likely exposes patients to thrombosis during a vulnerable
      period of reduced antiplatelet effect in the immediate post stenting period. Combination
      therapy with bivalirudin and prasugrel is conceptually attractive as the more rapid onset of
      action of prasugrel could potentially significantly diminish the vulnerable period, likely
      reducing the potential for acute stent thrombosis. The trials which have documented the
      efficacy of prasugrel as compared to clopidogrel have, in general, not reported on patients
      in whom bivalirudin was utilized. Currently, in the United States, bivalirudin is the most
      commonly used adjunctive agent used during PCI. Using light transmission aggregometry, this
      study will examine the inhibition of platelet aggregation in patients randomized to
      treatment with clopidogrel vs prasugrel during the vulnerable period following the
      discontinuation of bivalirudin therapy. The investigators anticipate that this study will
      document significant enhancement of inhibition of platelet aggregation in patients
      randomized to prasugrel treatment.

    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) targeting coronary lesions in patients with
      coronary syndromes leads to iatrogenic endothelial disruption and heightened platelet
      activation and aggregation. Blocking platelet aggregation with glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa
      inhibitors has been demonstrated to be of unequivocal benefit when combined with heparin in
      patients undergoing PCI. Heparin-mediated thrombin inhibition is an established therapy for
      safely performing PCI, however, there are several well known limitations of heparin
      including its variable anticoagulant effect due to nonlinear pharmacokinetics and
      inconsistent binding to blood proteins. In addition, heparin does not effectively block
      clot-bound thrombin and may cause thrombocytopenia.

      The direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), bivalirudin, which binds with high affinity to exosite
      I of thrombin, may be a safer alternative to other commonly used pharmacologic PCI adjuncts
      with an expert consensus document defining it as &quot;reasonable to use as an alternative to
      unfractionated heparin and GP IIb/IIIa antagonists in low-risk patients undergoing elective
      PCI&quot;. The ACUITY trial has supported the use of bivalirudin in patients with unstable
      coronary syndromes. This study showed similar rates of ischemic events and less bleeding
      when compared with patients treated with heparin and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Similar results
      were reported in the REPLACE-2 randomized trial, which studied a patient population with a
      lower prevalence of acute coronary syndromes. Recent results from our laboratory suggest
      that at least a part of the salutary effects of DTIs are due to a reduction of thrombin and
      to a lesser extent, collagen-mediated platelet activation.

      Inhibition of the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor is standard of care when added to aspirin in
      patients undergoing coronary stenting.  A 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel led to enhanced
      inhibition of platelet aggregation and a reduction in adverse clinical outcomes in
      Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) patients undergoing coronary
      stenting when compared to 300 mg. Other studies have documented that when compared with both
      300 and 600 mg loading doses of clopidogrel, a 60 mg loading dose of  prasugrel has been
      documented to eventuate in faster onset, greater magnitude and more consistent levels of
      platelet inhibition as measured by light transmission aggregometry. Several studies have
      documented significantly greater platelet inhibition with prasugrel treatment when compared
      to high-dose clopidogrel therapy. The more potent P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonist prasugrel
      significantly reduced the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and
      nonfatal stroke in higher-risk ACS patients referred for PCI. The salutary effects referable
      to prasugrel treatment in this study were mostly due to a reduction in the incidence of
      myocardial infarction.

      In the HORIZONS AMI trial patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who
      underwent primary PCI, anticoagulation with bivalirudin alone, as compared with heparin plus
      GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, resulted in significantly reduced 30-day rates of major bleeding and
      net adverse clinical events. Despite these results and those from our laboratory documenting
      a profound bivalirudin-mediated effect on platelet aggregation, closer analysis of the
      HORIZONS AMI trial has documented a higher acute stent thrombosis rate in bivalirudin as
      opposed to GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor treated patients. The investigators have recently
      documented that the half life of bivalirudin, at the currently utilized dose during cardiac
      interventions is 29.3 minutes. The relatively short half life of this DTI in concert with
      the relatively long time period required to activate clopidogrel from a prodrug to its
      active metabolite, likely exposes patients to a vulnerable period when there is suboptimal
      platelet inhibition. It is plausible that this vulnerable period when platelet activity is
      not inhibited was the proximate cause of early stent thrombosis in the HORIZONS trial.
      Consequently, earlier acting, more potent thienopyridine therapy, i.e. prasugrel, when
      combined with bivalirudin treatment has the potential to reduce bleeding (compared with GP
      IIb/IIIa inhibitors) while preventing peri-procedural MI as well as providing protection
      from platelet-mediated stent thrombosis (compared with clopidogrel) during the vulnerable
      period following PCI.

      The overwhelming majority of published data examining clinical outcomes or in-vivo
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences between clopidogrel and prasugrel have done
      so in PCI patients in whom bivalirudin was either not used or used very infrequently, i.e.
      in less than 10% of studied patients. However, at the present time in the United States,
      bivalirudin is the preeminent antithrombotic adjunctive therapy used during PCI.
      Consequently, comparative data regarding the effect of prasugrel and clopidogrel on platelet
      function in bivalirudin-treated patients is of significant clinical importance.
