  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Commercial probiotics can be delivered in numerous forms. The two most common delivery forms
      are similar to the two product formats to be tested.  It has been demonstrated using in
      vitro testing that probiotic organisms that are unprotected from gastric exposure may not
      survive that exposure and therefore may not remain viable throughout the rest of the GIT.
      (Unpublished studies conducted at SNA research facility, February, 2010.)  Similar in vitro
      testing of Acidophilus Pearls has demonstrated the probiotic organisms in an enteric capsule
      will survive gastric exposure.  It is anticipated that this difference in in vitro gastric
      survivability will translate to improved digestive tract survivability that can be
      demonstrated using fecal recovery techniques.

      The commercial product to be tested in this clinical trial has been in the market for over
      17 years.  However, it is not known what effect this commercial product has on the commensal
      probiotic population in the gut and particularly in the lower bowel where much of probiotic
      benefits are believed to be largely realized.  Also, it is not known what effect the
      commercial product has on the total commensal microbiota or fecal pH.  While commercial
      probiotic products have been largely aimed at benefits related to improved health, they also
      have the potential to change overall gut microbiota (probiotics as well as all others)
      composition and activities.  Learning what happens to the overall gut microbiota can be a
      helpful step in establishing the potential health benefits of the probiotic class of
      organisms in the test products.
