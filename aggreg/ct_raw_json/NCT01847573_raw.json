The study medication, HT-100, is a medicine that may\n      help promote healthy muscle regeneration, diminish inflammation and the resulting damage to\n      muscle, and decrease the scar tissue that forms in the muscles of children with DMD. In this\n      study, pharmacokinetic sampling, or measurements of the amount of HT-100 in the bloodstream\n      will also be taken."
