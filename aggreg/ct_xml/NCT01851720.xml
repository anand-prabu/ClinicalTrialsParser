  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headaches associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) cause severe pain. Headache
      management is complex, requiring a balance between pain control and preservation of
      neurological assessment. Sufficient pain control can be achieved with narcotics, however,
      these carry numerous undesirable side effects.  Most critically, all narcotics can result in
      respiratory depression and sedation.   For patients who present without neurological defects
      but debilitating pain, management is particularly challenging. The sedative effect of
      narcotics confounds the management of these patients by interfering with the neurological
      examination. Pain management is also a significant concern for patient's families as they
      observe suffering without full understanding of the importance of preserved mental status.
      In order to control the pain associated with SAH headaches, the use of narcotics is often
      required despite the risks. This standard therapy involves an IV bolus dose delivered by the
      provider regularly as needed for pain control.  A common approach to reduce pain in other
      patient populations, including acute pain relief following major spine surgery, is patient
      controlled analgesia (PCA).  With the PCA method, patients deliver low doses of narcotics
      through a pain pump with preset maximal doses and frequency of delivery. We hypothesize that
      this approach to pain relief for SAH headaches will result in lower pain scores, greater
      patient and family satisfaction scores, and increased patient safety with lower narcotic
      doses minimally interfering with neurological assessment.
