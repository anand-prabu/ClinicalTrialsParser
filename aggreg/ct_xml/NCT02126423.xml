  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of short courses of topical antibiotic drops before and/or after
      intravitreal injections is a common practice, but increasing evidence suggests this may not
      lower the risk of infectious endophthalmitis and could increase rates of antimicrobial
      resistance. The purpose of the present study is to determine the antimicrobial resistance
      profiles in patients who have received numerous (≥ 20) courses of antibiotics for
      intravitreal injection compared with untreated controls.

      This study compares 20 control patients without prior intravitreal injection to 20 patients
      who have undergone ≥ 20 prior intravitreal injections accompanied by a course of topical
      antibiotics for two days before and/or after the injection procedure. The lower, inner
      eyelid and nasal cavity were cultured and evaluated via disk diffusion method for
      antimicrobial sensitivity.

    <textblock>
      Before administration of anti-VEGF therapy (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) or topical
      antibiotics, conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs are procured with the Bacti-Swab
      transport system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For conjunctival samples, a
      sterile swab is moistened with ophthalmic balanced salt solution and gently swept along the
      lower fornix from the medial to the lateral canthi, with all attempts to avoid the eyelashes
      and eyelids. For nasopharyngeal cultures, the sterile swab is inserted 2 cm into the naris
      and rotated against the anterior nasal mucosa for 3 seconds.

      Culture swabs are then plated onto 5% sheep blood plates and incubated at 37°C for 3 days.
      Colonies are isolated and identified with API (Analytical Profile Index) Microbial
      Identification Kits (bioMérieux Inc., Hazelwood, MO). Antibiotic susceptibility is
      determined using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Additional data collected includes
      age, ocular and systemic medical conditions, and the number of intravitreal injections along
      with anti-VEGF agents used.

      Statistical calculations for antibiotic resistance comprises of t-test and and multivariate
      analysis.
