            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Focal hand dystonia (FHD) causes muscles to contract, leading to abnormal movements or\n      postures. Musicians, writers, and athletes often get it. Researchers want to study how\n      patients with this condition learn, a process of the brain that depends on a property called\n      plasticity.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To study brain plasticity in people with FHD.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Right-handed adults 18 years and older with FHD.\n\n        -  Healthy, right-handed adult volunteers.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, pregnancy test, and\n           questionnaire about their right-handedness.\n\n        -  Participants will have 2 study visits on 2 different days.\n\n        -  Participants will sit in a chair and have up to 30 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\n           (TMS) pulses on the left side of the head. A brief electrical current passes through a\n           wire coil on the scalp. They will hear a click and may feel a pulling on the skin or\n           muscle twitches. They may have to keep their eyes open and remain alert, tense certain\n           muscles, or perform simple finger movements.\n\n        -  Forty more pulses, with 10 seconds between, will be given on the left side of the head.\n           Some will be small, some big.\n\n        -  Researchers will measure muscle response through small electrodes taped to the right\n           hand.\n\n        -  A cloth cap will be put on the participant   s head. Researchers will write on tape on\n           the cap.\n\n        -  Participants will have the r-PAS. An electrical stimulator will be placed on the nerve\n           at the right wrist. Repeated magnetic pulses will be delivered in trains or short\n           bursts together with electrical stimulation of nerve. Participants will receive up to\n           840 pulses.\n\n        -  Participants will be contacted after a few days for a follow-up check."

We will complete phase 1\n      before starting phase 2. Each phase is composed of 2 experiments. In phase 1, experiments 1\n      and 2 will create the LTD-like effect and DePo in HVs and in phase 2, experiments 3 and 4\n      will elicit the LTD-like effect and DePo in FHD patients. We will use regression analysis to\n      show that the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude declines after eliciting the LTD-like\n      effect and DePo.\n\n      Outcome measurements:\n\n      Primary outcome:\n\n      Determining the parameters for creating the LTD-like effect and DePo in HVs and FHD using\n      rPAS\n\n      Secondary outcome:\n\n      Measuring the percent change of the MEP amplitude after applying the proper stimulus\n      parameters causing an LTD-like effect and DePo in both HVs and FHD."
