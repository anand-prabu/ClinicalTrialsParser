The purposes of the study are: 1) to allow NIDCR staff\n      an opportunity to maintain and improve their clinical skills; and 2) to evaluate referred\n      patients for research potential.  (Participants in this protocol will not be required to\n      join a research study; the decision will be voluntary.)\n\n      Patients in need of dental/oral diagnosis and therapy of interest to NIDCR staff dentists\n      may be eligible for this protocol.  Participants will have a comprehensive dental\n      examination and may receive part or all of their treatment at the NIDCR clinic.  Diagnostic\n      procedures, materials and treatments used in this study are limited to those widely accepted\n      in dentistry and are non-experimental in nature."
