  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the allergen ethylenediamine dihydrochloride when
      prepared using methylcellulose versus preparation using polyvinylpyrrolidone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose an open, prospective, single-site study to evaluate the bioequivalence of
      ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in methylcellulose (MC)and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
      formulations. Bioequivalence will be determined in 15 adult subjects, with a clinical
      history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to
      ethylenediamine (&quot;sensitives&quot;).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or previous symptoms and/or history consistent with allergic contact
             dermatitis, and positive patch test (within the past 10 years) to ethylenediamine
             dihydrochloride

          -  18 years of age or older, otherwise in good health

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must consent to a urine pregnancy test;
             results must be negative for study inclusion.

          -  Informed consent signed and understood by each subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects unable to meet inclusion requirements

          -  Women who are breastfeeding or pregnant

          -  Topical treatment during the last 7 days with corticosteroids or other
             immunosuppressive agents on or near the test area

          -  Systemic treatment during the last 7 days with corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt; 10 mg
             prednisone) or other immunosuppressive agents

          -  Treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light (including tanning) during the previous 3 weeks

          -  Acute dermatitis outbreak or dermatitis on or near the test area on the back

          -  Subjects unable to comply with patch test study requirements including multiple
             return visits and activity restrictions (e.g., protecting test panels from excess
             moisture due to showering or vigorous activity)

          -  Subject participation in clinical trials of investigational drugs, treatments, or
             devices, other than T.R.U.E. TEST, during this study or 3 weeks prior to inclusion in
             this study
