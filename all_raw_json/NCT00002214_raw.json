(4 patients) low-dose po,\n      fasting.\n\n      Single-dose study (Cohort 2), administered during the first 3 levels of the repeated dose\n      study and prior to the initiation of the 4th repeated dose level:\n\n      (4 patients): intermediate-dose po, following a standardized morning meal. (4 patients):\n      intermediate-dose po, fasted. Following treatment with S-1153, all single-dose patients\n      (Cohorts 1and 2) are observed for 21 days.\n\n      Repeated dose (escalation) study:\n\n      All doses are administered for 14 days. Three patients are entered at the starting dose of\n      S-1153. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), subsequent 3-patient cohorts are\n      entered at 3 escalating doses.\n\n      The last patient at any given dose level must be observed for 21 days prior to entry of\n      patient at the next dose. If 1 of the initial 3 patients experiences DLT at a given level, 3\n      additional patients will be added at that dose; if no additional toxicity occurs, escalation\n      resumes. If 2 or more patients at a given dose exhibit DLT, the previous dose is declared\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 3 additional patients (6 total) are treated at that\n      dose."
