All patients coming for both groups were followed at 4-week\n      intervals by a nurse practitioner and dietitian for 6 months, Nurse practitioner made the\n      dietetics adjustments (750-1500 Kcal) , provide advice and assess the evolution  of weight\n      loss The hypothesis was that preoperative IGB-BIB  helps  the patients to lose weight ( more\n      than 10%) ,and the weight loss will contribute to decrease surgical morbidity by  at least\n      30%, and also  will decrease  hospital stay Objective: to check if morbidity, mortality and\n      hospital stay decreased in the IGB-BIB \u00ae group, and secondly if the weight before surgery\n      was associated with surgical morbidity. secondary objective : Assess the rate of  IGB-BIB\n      failure.Intragastric balloon failure  was considered when the weight loss is less than 10%\n      from the initial weight. We defined severe complication whenever the patient had to be\n      admitted in the hospital after discharge, new surgeries or transfusions were required or the\n      hospital stay was longer than 7-10 days."
