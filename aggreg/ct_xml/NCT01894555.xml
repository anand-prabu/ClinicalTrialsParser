  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is examining the effect of 4-week aspirin therapy on platelet
      transcriptome in persons at high-risk for myocardial infarction or stroke due to family
      history of early-onset coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet aggregation can initiate thrombosis on ulcerated arterial plaques resulting in
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS). There is large variation in platelet aggregation between
      individuals. As the genetic message to the cell machinery is conveyed through its
      transcriptome, we hypothesize that much of the variability in platelet function can be
      explained by transcriptome changes including differences in gene or isoform expression,
      altered splicing events, or allele-specific expression. Moreover, aspirin modifies gene
      expression in several cells, but whether it also affects platelet transcriptome has not yet
      been studied. Our goal is to characterize the platelet transcriptome and identify genes that
      are up- or down-regulated after 4-week aspirin therapy. A major strength of our study is
      that it enrolls individuals from European Americans and African Americans and thus will have
      the ability to study similarities and differences between the two. The study will produce
      innovative comparative genomic/platelet phenotype data and will provide a potential
      pharmacogenomic and diagnostic template for the future discovery of novel antiplatelet
      regimens to prevent thrombosis-related cardiovascular disease events.
