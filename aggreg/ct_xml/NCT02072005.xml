  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to conduct a 9-patient feasibility and acceptability study
      of mSMART (with future studies focusing on improved medication adherence). The sample will
      include daily smokers who are already taking a prescribed medication. There will be no
      change in any medication regimen in this study, and the sample will include smokers either
      with or without a psychiatric disorder. Subjects will be asked to use a smartphone
      application, or &quot;app&quot; (i.e. mSMART) that will provide information about their medication and
      when to take it. Along with smart phone, the participants will be asked to utilize an
      electronic pillbox (i.e. GlowCap) to further assist with medication compliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be 9 nicotine dependent male and female smokers who take at least one
      prescribed medication regularly. This sample will allow for psychiatric comorbidity, though
      is not required. They will be asked to carry a smartphone for 7 days and use a smartphone
      application, also called an &quot;app,&quot; (i.e. mSMART) that will provide information about their
      medication and when to take it. Along with smart phone, the participants will be asked to
      utilize an electronic pillbox (i.e. GlowCap) to further assist with medication compliance.
      The study consists of a Screening Visit (~4Â½ hours), Training Visit (~1 hour), and 1
      Follow-Up Session (~2 hours). Post the Training visit, subjects will then complete the week
      observation period. During that time, subjects will complete experimenter-prompted
      assessments to assess factors that may interfere with medication adherence (e.g.,
      psychiatric symptoms, such as forgetfulness). As part of the 'app', reminders will be sent
      to subjects to take their medication (e.g., the reminders will be programmed to accommodate
      multiple times a day dosing within dosage schedule windows). Subjects will also be provided
      with an electronic pillbox that will dispense the subject's medication over the 7 day
      observation period. After the 7 day period, subjects will return the smartphone at the
      follow-up visit. Primary outcome variable measured will be medication adherence as an
      indicator of feasibility and acceptability of the mSMART app.

      This study is an observational study since participants will already be taking a medication
      prescribed by their own physician. The sample is a non-treatment seeking sample of adult
      cigarette smokers. Participants will not be asked to modify their smoking behavior or
      medication use in any way. Participants will receive two devices (i.e., [1] the smartphone
      with mSMART and [2] GlowCap) over the seven day observation period of smoking behavior and
      medication adherence. The ultimate goal of mSMART is to assist with medication adherence and
      is thus an intervention, although the goal of this study is to assess how acceptable and
      feasible it is in a sample already adherent to their medications. We do not predict any
      changes in smoking behavior or medication adherence once participants are provided with
      mSMART or GlowCap. GlowCap is being used to allow the investigators to measure times at
      which the medications were taken.

        Participants will be 15 adult, nicotine dependent smokers for a target completion sample
        of 9. Subjects will be allowed to meet criteria for a current comorbid psychiatric
        disorder (e.g., Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD], Post-Traumatic Stress
        Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder), though non-psychiatric smokers will be included as
        well. Participants will be taking some form of prescribed psychiatric medication or
        nicotine replacement therapy in pill form.
