Patients are randomized into one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I: Patients undergo a core biopsy and decompression of the hip followed by a\n      standardized program of touch down or nonweight bearing with appropriate equipment and\n      regular physical therapy for 6 weeks and then full weight bearing if tolerated.\n\n      Arm II: Patients undergo the standardized ambulation and physical therapy program as in arm\n      I.  They do not undergo any surgical procedure.\n\n      For 1 week prior to the beginning of the standardized program and during the 6 weeks of\n      touch down or nonweight bearing, all patients complete a weekly pain and medication diary.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 months and 6 months, then every 6 months for 1.5 years, and then\n      annually for up to 5 years."
