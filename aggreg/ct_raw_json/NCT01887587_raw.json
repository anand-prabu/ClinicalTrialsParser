If the patient experiences a DLT\n      the dose of MLN maybe reduced to the next dose level on day 8 or day 15 in that patient. DLT\n      would be any grade 3 or more toxicity which is thought to be probably or definitely related\n      to MLN9708. Three patients will be treated per dose level unless dose limiting toxicity\n      (DLT) is observed.  The starting dose of MLN9708 will be 2.3 mg orally on days 1, 8 and 15.\n      If toxicity is seen at this level then dose may be reduced to 1.5 mg (dose level -1) .  If\n      no DLT is seen in the first 3 patients, the dose will be increased to 3 mg and then to 4 mg\n      orally on days 1, 8 and 15 in a classic 3 +3 phase I design. We will not attempt to increase\n      the dose beyond 4 mg orally which, if achieved with acceptable toxicity, would be accepted\n      as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 0 of 3 DLTs would allow escalation to the next dose\n      level. 1 of 3 DLTs will require expanding to six patients; 1 of 6 DLTs will allow escalation\n      again. 2 DLTs will require dose de-escalation.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be the\n      highest dose administered at which no more than 1 DLT was observed. All patients will be\n      evaluated for hematopoetic stem cell transplantation. If patients achieve CR and are\n      eligible for HSCT, they will proceed to HSCT. If they are not eligible, no donor is\n      identified or if HSCT will be delayed, and the patient has achieved benefit, then treatment\n      maybe repeated at the discretion of the investigator. A total of 9-18 patients will be\n      enrolled on the study. The study duration would be about 2 years."
