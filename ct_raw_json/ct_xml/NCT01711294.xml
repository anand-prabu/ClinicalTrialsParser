  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To document impact of EUS-FNA needle size and flexibility on effectiveness of pancreatic
      cystic lesions (PCL) aspiration, on ability to obtain sufficient material for standard
      diagnostic testing, and on diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA aspirate for differentiation of
      mucinous (pre-malignant) and non-mucinous cysts.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pancreatic cystic lesion measuring 13mm or greater in largest diameter.

          -  Indicated for EUS evaluation of the PCL including EUS-FNA.

          -  Age 18 years of age or older.

          -  Willing and able to comply with the study procedures and provide written informed
             consent form to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cysts in which FNA is not indicated based on review by the clinician,  including
             potential concern of blood vessel location relative to the cyst.

          -  Requirement for anticoagulation using clopidogril, warfarin, or other long  acting
             antiplatelet agents (with the exception of aspirin) that cannot be safely stopped
             according to institutional guidelines.

          -  Standard contraindications for EUS.

          -  Known pancreatic pseudocyst.

          -  Pregnancy.
