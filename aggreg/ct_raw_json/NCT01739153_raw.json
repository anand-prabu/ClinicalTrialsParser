Furthermore, effects on\n      fat digestibility, blood pressure, anthropometry, bile acid metabolism and insulin\n      sensitivity is investigated.\n\n      To do this, a randomized crossover intervention study with 3x14 days full diet periods\n      (cheese diet, meat diet or carb diet)will be conducted  in 16 postmenopausal women. Between\n      the diet periods there will be at least 14 days of wash-out where the subjects eat their\n      habitual diets. Fasting blood samples will be drawn before and after the diet periods, and\n      also a non-fasting blood sample will be drawn after the diet periods. Furthermore, total\n      feces is collected the last 5 days of each diet period."
