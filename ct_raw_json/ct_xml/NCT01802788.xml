             AND a mean transvalvular gradient greater than (&gt;) 40mmHg or jet velocity greater
             than (&gt;) 4.0 m/s derived by resting echocardiogram [or dobutamine stress
             echocardiogram if subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%].
             (Baseline measurement taken by echo within 45 days of index procedure).

          -  Patient has a life expectancy more than (&gt;) 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any case in which the Portico Valve would not be indicated for the patient as per
             current instructions for use (i.e any &quot;off-label&quot; use).

          -  Patient has a bicuspid aortic valve.

          -  Patient has a prosthetic valve or ring in the aortic position.

          -  Patient needs a concomitant structural heart procedure.

          -  Patient needs the usage of an embolic protection device.

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with all clinical investigation-required
             follow-up evaluations.
