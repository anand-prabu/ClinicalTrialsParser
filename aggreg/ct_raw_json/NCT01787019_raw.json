The Later\n      Oral Feeding group will initiate oral feedings at 33 0/7 weeks postmenstrual age.  The\n      number of oral feeding attempts will be advanced according to a feeding progression protocol\n      for both groups.  Successful completion of a feeding is defined as oral completion of the\n      full volume of a feeding within 30 minutes, without a bradycardic episode (heart rate <100\n      beats per minute) or desaturation (oxygen saturation decrease >5% from baseline values).  If\n      infant does not successfully complete >95% of the total prescribed volume of a feeding, the\n      remainder of the volume will be supplied via gastric tube.  All oral feedings will be\n      performed by bedside nurses, or by a parent with observation by the nursing staff, with\n      continuous cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring.  Individual oral feeding\n      attempts for both groups will continue until one of the following occurs despite appropriate\n      pacing of the feeding: 1) the feeding is completed 2) feeding duration of 30 minutes 3)\n      adverse event during a feeding [multiple bradycardic episodes (3 episodes of heart rate <100\n      beats per minute), bradycardia with choking episode, single severe bradycardia (heart rate\n      <60)].  If the infant experiences an adverse event during an oral feeding attempt, oral\n      feeding attempts will be held for 2 days."
