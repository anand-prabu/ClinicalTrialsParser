Vorinostat is an orally available HDAC inhibitor with clinical activity in\n      MDS and proven in vitro synergy with AZA. Patient treated upfront with a combination of this\n      agents have shown more responses based on phase I/II data. In the present study, we will use\n      the combination of these two drugs to try to create a synergetic effect and generate a\n      response for patients who experienced treatment failure after AZA.\n\n      All eligible patients will be treated with Azacitidine and oral vorinostat for 6 cycles of\n      28 days.
