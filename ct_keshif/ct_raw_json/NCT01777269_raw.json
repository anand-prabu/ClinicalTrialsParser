Men eligible at screening will be randomised, after a 4 week placebo run-in, to the\n      2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. All men will receive standardised lifestyle advice\n      (primarily concerning weight management and exercise) relevant to maintaining sexual\n      function. Men will also receive a standardised lifestyle advice leaflet for BPH. The double\n      blind phase will continue for 12 months, with assessment visits at 2 weeks and at months 1,\n      3, 6, 9 and a final visit at month 12. Subjects with sexual adverse events during the double\n      blind phase will continue to be followed at scheduled study visits until resolution of the\n      adverse event or at a visit 6 months after the last dose of study medication, whichever is\n      sooner.\n\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n      To assess the change in sexual function from baseline to 1 year in sexually active men with\n      at least moderate BPH (international prostate symptom score - IPSS = or > 12) who are\n      treated with DUODART, compared to men treated with placebo . Change in sexual function will\n      be assessed by change in total score from the full men's sexual health questionnaire (MSHQ)\n      which has domains for erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory function and libido."
