            "textblock": "Vitamin D is not seen anymore only as a phosphocalcic hormone, but also as having an effect\n      on global health (anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour roles and cardiovascular\n      protection).\n\n      The link between vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia lesions is well-known. In\n      paediatrics, systematic vitamin D supplementation of infants and toddlers, associated with\n      milk enrichment, has allowed an almost total disappearance of rickets. Vitamin D repletion\n      was defined as the minimal concentration that enables the prevention of rickets in children\n      and osteomalacia in adults, that is approximately 8 ng/mL (20 nmol/L). However, in 2010,\n      most of the international experts agreed to set minimal threshold of 25 OH vitamin D serum\n      concentration, higher than the one previously admitted, with a limit of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)\n      to define a vitamin D deficiency and a limit of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) to define vitamin D\n      insufficiency  in adults. In the paediatric population, the consensus is less obvious and we\n      consider that a serum concentration of minimum 20 ng/mL is necessary.\n\n      A study on more than 200 children from Lyon, followed in the paediatric nephrology unit and\n      having a renal function normal or sub-normal, demonstrated an important prevalence of\n      vitamin D deficiency (75%) in adolescents and pre-adolescents.\n\n      Concurrently, the appearance of new bone imaging techniques (especially high-resolution\n      peripheral quantitative computed tomography HR-pQCT) improved bone status evaluation in a\n      non-invasive manner.\n\n      Given the new pathophysiological data on pleiotropic role of vitamin D (bone, cardiovascular\n      system, adipose tissue) and given the proportion of French children possibly suffering from\n      vitamin D deficiency, it seems urgent to actualize current recommendations regarding\n      systematic supplementation in vitamin D. This transversal study on 200 healthy children and\n      adolescents will allow to have an overview of vitamin D status in French healthy children\n      and adolescents, studying with non-invasive, safe, reliable and innovative tools, the\n      theoretical targets of vitamin D (bones, cardiovascular system and nutritional status); and\n      then to lay the foundations of therapeutic trials aiming to evaluate the mode of vitamin D\n      supplementation for healthy children and adolescents; while having a cohort for HR-pQCT\n      measurements, that will allow us to have French reference range in a 10-17 year-old\n      population, for this innovative, non-invasive and low radiation exposure technique."
