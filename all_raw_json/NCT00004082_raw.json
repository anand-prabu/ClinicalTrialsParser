Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel, carboplatin, and\n      gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated, newly diagnosed, high-risk epithelial\n      cancer of mullerian origin.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel and gemcitabine. Patients receive\n      docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Carboplatin\n      IV is administered over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 6\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-5\n      patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 5\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-2\n      years."
