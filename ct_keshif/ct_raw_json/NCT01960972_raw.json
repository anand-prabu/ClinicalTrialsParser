The order in which the different individuals or clusters receive the intervention is determined at random and, by the end of the random allocation, all individuals or groups will have received the intervention. Stepped wedge designs incorporate data collection at each point where a new group (step) receives the intervention.\nThus, the salt substitute will be implemented in each cluster (village) in a randomized fashion. Not arms are needed since the 6 randomly-selected villages will be implemented in some moment of the protocol."

Also, the increase of potassium ingestion in minimal doses\n      has been found in systematic reviews to produce a small reduction in blood pressure levels.\n\n      The proposed intervention is a community-wide mass-strategy in which direct delivery of a\n      salt substitute to households is accompanied by wide social marketing campaigns, both before\n      and during the intervention period. With this experimental stepped wedge trial design, we\n      will estimate the impact of a reduced-sodium salt substitution program on blood pressure at\n      the population level.\n\n      We propose the following specific aims:\n\n      Specific Aim 1: To implement and assess the impact of an intervention using a salt\n      substitute on blood pressure at the population level using a stepped wedge trial design.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: To determine costs and efficacy of this implementation strategy using\n      cost-effectiveness analysis."
