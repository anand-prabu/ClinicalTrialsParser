        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt; 25 years

          -  Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy as noted on fluorescein and ICG angiography: active
             leakage, active bleeding or recent decrease in vision

          -  BCVA using ETDRS of 20/32 to 20/400

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of previous vitrectomy

          -  Any prior treatment with verteporfin photodynamic therapy in the study eye.

          -  Previous cataract surgery within the preceding 2 months of Day 0

          -  Active intraocular inflammation in the study eye

          -  Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either
             eye

          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease)

          -  Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that
             involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at the
             time of study entry.

          -  Prior anti-VEGF (Macugen, Avastin, Lucentis) in the study eye prior within 30 days
             prior to enrollment in this study

          -  Known allergy to any component of the study drug

          -  Blood pressure &gt;180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110)  If blood
             pressure if brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, the patient can
             become eligible.

          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to randomization or major surgery planned within
             the next 12 months.  Major surgery is defined as a surgical procedure that is more
             extensive than needle biopsy/aspiration placement of a central venous access device,
             removal/biopsy of a skin lesion, or placement of a peripheral venous catheter.

          -  Myocardial infraction, other cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 6
             months prior to randomization.

          -  Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 3 months prior to randomization.

          -  History of recurrent significant infections or bacterial infections

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          -  Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception.  The following are considered
             effective means of contraception, surgical sterilization or use of oral
             contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in
             conjunction with spermicide gel, an IUD, or contraceptive hormone implant or patch

          -  Prior enrollment in the study

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated

          -  Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial.
