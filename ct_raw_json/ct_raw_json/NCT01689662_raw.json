Up to 40 subjects, with known or strongly\n      suspected metastatic renal cell carcinoma with at least one target lesion detected by a\n      diagnostic imaging procedure (e.g. ultrasonography, CT, or MRI), will be enrolled in this\n      study."

            "textblock": "The investigational new drug (FolateScan or Technetium Tc 99m EC20) is a folate-targeted\n      diagnostic radiopharmaceutical designed to bind to the folate receptor. The folate receptor\n      is a glycoprotein that is over-expressed in many types of cancer cells but it is only\n      minimally distributed in normal tissues. Folate conjugates bind to the folate receptor with\n      high affinity and are brought into the cell via endocytosis. In contrast, folic acid itself\n      enters most normal cells via the reduced folate carrier, a pathway entirely inaccessible to\n      folate conjugates. Therefore, these folate conjugates are specific to cancer cells.\n\n      Endocyte's folate-targeted delivery system was applied towards the targeting of a diagnostic\n      imaging agent (111In-DTPA-Folate) to ovarian cancer tumors. This proof-of-principle study\n      was designed to demonstrate the ability of folate to target drugs to\n      folate-receptor-positive (FR+) cancer tissue."
