      This is called &quot;Aim 1&quot; of the investigators' NIH grant.  Ondansetron (Zofran) is a safe and
      effective drug used in pregnant women to prevent nausea but the investigators do not know
      what effect pregnancy may have on the metabolism of Zofran in pregnant women or their
      babies. Therefore the investigators will enroll approximately 40 pregnant women and their
      babies and draw blood samples from the mother, the baby and the cord, to determine how much
      Zofran is in each sample of blood (called the pharmacokinetics or PK of Zofran). The
      pregnant women will receive Zofran, as a standard-of-care drug, for their scheduled Cesarean
      Section.

      The investigators will also enroll about 20 non-pregnant women undergoing surgery who will
      receive Zofran as standard-of-care during surgery. In both the pregnant &amp; the non-pregnant
      women, the investigators will draw blood samples at the same time points based on number of
      minutes from the time the Zofran is given. The blood data (PK of Zofran) will help the
      investigators move into Aim 2 of the study, which will be done in pregnant,
      narcotic-addicted mothers and their babies who are born addicted to narcotics.  Aim 2 will
      be listed separately as it will be an interventional study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase of the study is Aim 1 and it will lead to Aim 2, which specifically will address
      the Prevention of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS).

      NAS is a constellation of narcotic drug withdrawal symptoms that develops in 42-94% of the
      infants born to narcotic dependent mothers.  This severe syndrome, of which there are no
      preventative treatments, can result in prolonged hospitalization, some of which may be in
      the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The investigators have shown that ondansetron can
      eliminate or alleviate the symptoms of narcotic drug withdrawal in experimental studies in
      mice and in humans.  Based upon these results, it is quite possible that ondansetron
      administration to pregnant narcotic-using mothers just prior to delivery, followed by a
      3-day period of ondansetron administration to the neonate, could reduce the incidence or
      severity of NAS symptoms.

      AIM 1 is a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of intravenous (IV) ondansetron in three different
      groups of participants: Study Group #1 = non-pregnant women undergoing surgery;  Study Group
      #2 = pregnant women scheduled for cesarean section delivery; Study Group #3 = viable, full
      term, singleton neonates born to study group #2 mothers.   Group #1 will be given IV
      ondansetron prior to their surgery and up to 5 PK blood samples will be drawn from an
      indwelling IV line or by IV stick.  The PK samples will be 2-5 ml each and will be drawn at
      baseline (prior to ondansetron) and then at 7, 15, and 40 min and 8 hours after the
      ondansetron.  Group #2 will be given IV ondansetron prior to their cesarean section and up
      to 6 PK blood samples will be drawn from an indwelling IV line or by IV stick.  The PK
      samples will be 2-5 ml each and will be drawn at baseline, 7, 15, 40 min and prior to
      delivery and 8 hours after the ondansetron is given.  The Group #3 neonates will provide a
      section of the umbilical cord from which arterial and venous blood samples will be drawn
      (this section of cord would normally be thrown out and the parents are consenting to allow
      the Investigators to take these two samples).  Each time the baby has a &quot;Standard-of-Care&quot;
      lab test ordered by heel stick or needle stick, the investigators will obtain a few drops of
      blood to place on the special research filter paper to determine how much ondansetron is in
      the baby's blood.  If the parents will allow any extra heel sticks, the Investigators will
      try to obtain 1-2 samples of blood in the first 6 hours of life.  If the parents only want
      their baby's blood taken at the standard-of-care lab draws, then the first scheduled lab
      draw is at 24 hours of life for the newborn screening which is a mandated by state law.  All
      blood samples taken for this study are being processed by the investigator, not the Stanford
      Lab.  Also, the investigators are doing the PK analysis of the dried blood spots on the
      filter paper and the analysis of the frozen plasma samples.

      Aim 2 of this NIH grant will be entered separately into ClinicalTrials.gov. It will be a
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether
      ondansetron treatment will reduce the incidence or severity of NAS in babies born to
      narcotic-using mothers.

The neonates blood samples are taken any time a standard-of-care heel stick is done (only a few drops of blood are needed) in first 48 hours after birth.  If the parents agree, heel sticks may be done for research purposes only, within the first 48 hours of life.</description>
