Forty patients\n      aged between 25-60 years old from both sexes are recruited. Patients consume 50gr/day\n      concentrated pomegranate juice for 4 weeks. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements,\n      3-days food-record questionnaire ,physical activity and fasting blood samples were collected\n      at the beginning and at the end of the study. Fasting blood sugar, lipid profile, TNF- a,\n      IL-6,hs -CRP and adiponectin levels are measured. LDL are calculated by formula. The\n      participants are asked not to change their regular diet, medicine and activity during the\n      study."
