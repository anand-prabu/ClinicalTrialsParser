Ipsilateral ( same side as the\n      block) and contralateral ( opposite side of block) hemi-diaphragmatic excursion will be\n      measured with the patients in supine position during quiet inspiration ,deep inspiration and\n      forceful sniff.\n\n      In addition, bedside spirometry using a compact spirometer will be performed and FVC, FEV1\n      and PEFR measurements will be performed.The oxygen saturation and any evidence of dyspnea or\n      shortness of breadth will be noted at the above mentioned intervals after the completion of\n      the block.\n\n      All patients will receive general anesthesia in the operating room. The patient will receive\n      IV opioids during the procedure if required.\n\n      The above mentioned data will be collected postoperatively in the recovery room 30 mins,60\n      mins  and 120"
