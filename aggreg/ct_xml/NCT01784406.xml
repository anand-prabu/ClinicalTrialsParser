  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women treated for gynaecological cancer perceive many difficulties in life on the personal,
      social, and physical levels. Today they are offered a 3 to 5 year follow-up programme at the
      hospital where the main purpose is to improve survival. However, the women are very nervous
      before follow-up visits and although they feel safe about them, they express that their
      needs of psychosocial care and self-management support are not fulfilled.

      The proposed study will test a person-centred intervention tailored the women's needs in a
      randomised controlled trial. The intervention will be based on the method Guided Self
      Determination (GSD), which has proved able to realize empowerment in practice in
      relationships between patients and healthcare professionals. GSD involves systematic use of
      condition-adjusted worksheets ('reflection sheets'), and advanced professional
      communication. Using reflection sheets filled out by each woman as the starting point for
      communication, problem solving will be tailored her personal needs. We expect that the
      intervention has the potential to support the women in better managing specific
      complications and difficulties related to concerns about recovery, body perception,
      fertility and establishment of intimate relations with their partner, all aspects important
      for the women's quality of life in the follow-up period after cancer diagnosis and
      treatment. The study will be the first to test GSD in cancer patients.
