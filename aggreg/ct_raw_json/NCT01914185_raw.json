Children will therefore be less likely overweight or obese.\n      Beginning in January 2008, the Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating in\n      Schools (APPLE Schools) was implemented in 10 schools throughout the Canadian Province,\n      Alberta. Full-time School Health Facilitators were placed in each of the schools to\n      implement what is know in Canada as Comprehensive School Health (CSH). In the United States,\n      CSH is more commonly referred to as \"Coordinated School Health\", while the synonymous term\n      \"Health Promoting Schools\" is often used in Australia and Europe. The project was evaluated\n      annually in the spring from 2008 to 2011 and as of 2009 evaluations included the use of\n      time-stamped pedometers. The comparison group included approximately 150 schools that were\n      randomly selected to reflect the population of Alberta, Canada. Twenty of these randomly\n      selected schools also participated in data collection which involved the use of time-stamped\n      pedometers."

As out primary interest is to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity\n      in schools, the essential comparisons were across grade five students in differing calendar\n      years. At each survey all grade five students were invited to participate. The current\n      design allowed intervention effects to be assessed over time at the school-level. Surveys\n      were administered in the spring of 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 in intervention schools. And\n      in the spring of 2008 and 2011 in control schools."
