Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to\n      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining erlotinib with\n      cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining erlotinib and cisplatin in\n      treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer."

For the second and subsequent courses, patients\n      receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-21 and cisplatin as in course 1. Treatment\n      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease after 6 courses may\n      continue to receive erlotinib alone until disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib and cisplatin until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are\n      treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 43 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months."
