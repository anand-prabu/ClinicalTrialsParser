The total amount of blood drawn from patients\n      for all blood work including routine blood tests as well as pharmacokinetics will not be\n      greater than 5% of the total blood volume.\n\n      We will also have all urine output collected for 8 hours starting at the time patients\n      receive the dose of valacyclovir. A 5cc sample of urine will be collected and analyzed to\n      determine how the body handles the drug at hours 2, 4, 6, and 8."
