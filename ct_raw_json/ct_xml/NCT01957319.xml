    <textblock>
      Background: Hepatitis C virus infection and interferon treatment have shown to be risk
      factors for depression, distressing, psychosocial burden and poor health-related quality of
      life.

      Aim: To determine the effect of a Sylibin-vitamin E-phoshpolipids complex on work ability
      and whether health related factors (anxiety and depression) were associated with work
      ability in subjects with chronic hepatitis C treated with Peg-IFN-α and RBV.

      Patients and Methods: In this prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind
      clinical trial, 31 subjects (Group A) with chronic hepatitis, received
      Pegylated-Interferon-α2b (1.5 mg/kg per week) plus Ribavirin and placebo, while 31 subjects
      (Group B) received the same dosage of  Pegylated-Interferon-α2b plus Ribavirin plus
      association of Silybin 94 mg + vitamin E 90 mg + phospholipids 194 mg in one pill for 12
      months. All subjects underwent laboratory exams and questionnaires to evaluate depression
      (Beck Depression Inventory - BDI), anxiety (State-trait anxiety inventory - STAI) and work
      ability (Work ability Index - WAI).

    <description>Administration of questionnaire(Work ability Index - WAI)The work ability index is a tool to record the work ability of employees. It aims at identifying, at an early stage, health risks of early retirement an counteracting them. The questionnaire is aimed at: 1) the estimated current and future work ability; 2) diagnosed illness and the number of absenteeism days in the previous year; 3) the estimated sickness-related deterioration in the work performance; 4) mental ability reserves.  The WAI evaluates current work ability compared with lifetime and in relation to the demands of the job, number of current diseases diagnosed by a physician, estimated work impairment due to diseases.</description>
