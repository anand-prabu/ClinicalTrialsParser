OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY i. Primary objective Long-term (2 years or greater) atazanavir\n      experience in HIV-1 infected patients in a primary care setting through retrospective data\n      collection.\n\n      ii. Secondary objectives\n\n        1. To illustrate long term therapeutic efficacy of atazanavir in ART na\u00efve and experienced\n           HIV-1 infected patients.\n\n        2. To illustrate long term tolerability to atazanavir in ART na\u00efve and experienced HIV-1\n           infected patients.\n\n        3. To identify ART treatment history in ART na\u00efve and experienced HIV-1 infected patients\n           on ATV.\n\n        4. To identify contraindicated therapy in ART na\u00efve and experienced HIV-1 infected\n           patients on ATV."
