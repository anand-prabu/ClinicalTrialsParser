Determine the biologic activity and toxicity of neoadjuvant SCH 66336 with or\n      without gemcitabine followed by surgical resection vs surgical resection alone in patients\n      with resectable primary liver cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to one of three\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral SCH 66336 twice daily for 14 days\n      followed by surgical resection. Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral SCH 66336 twice\n      daily for 14 days and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 2 weeks followed by\n      surgical resection. Arm III: Patients undergo surgical resection. Patients receive no\n      neoadjuvant therapy prior to resection.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
