Up to now, no\n      effective prophylaxis have been developed for PN. Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside, a\n      nerve-protecting drug,was often used to promote growth of nerve, and function restoration of\n      damaged nerve.Thus,the  investigators hypothesized that combination of\n      Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside and bortezomib can reduce the incidence rate of peripheral\n      neuropathy (PN) and promote the relief of peripheral neuropathy (PN) in multiple myeloma\n      (MM) patients."
