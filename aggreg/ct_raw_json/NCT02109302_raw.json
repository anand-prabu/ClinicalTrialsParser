We will test and evaluate the existence of genetic determinism\n      conferring susceptibility to a life-long syndrome (primary premature ejaculation) in some\n      patients. To this end, we plan to establish a collection of biological samples and a\n      database of patients with this extreme syndrome, which we will analyze by Genome Wide\n      analysis. This will lead to improvements in the biological understanding, the \"knowledge\" of\n      physicians of the disease, and should improve the patients' quality of life. Not all PE\n      cases have the same physiopathology and treatment efficiency, which depend on the specific\n      mechanism involved in the clinical context. Our work will make it possible to develop new\n      therapeutic approaches suitable for a large proportion of individuals presenting PE. This\n      integrative approach combining researchers, patients and ethics committees will facilitate\n      profound reflection, promoting the creation of suitable structures capable of receiving\n      patients for appropriate consultations. This unique study of PE should also favor industrial\n      partnerships."

Because all the\n           PE do not have the same pathophysiology and treatment success depends on its relevance\n           to the specific mechanism of the clinical form concerned.\n\n        -  Increase the comfort of life of the patients.\n\n        -  Eliminate public prejudice based on misconceptions."
