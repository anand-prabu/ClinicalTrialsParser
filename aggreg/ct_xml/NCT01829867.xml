        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a diagnosis of idiopathic PD

          -  Previous participation in study sNN0031-001 with completion of 12 study weeks without
             development of clinically significant safety concerns defined as being any
             drug-related or device related SAE that resulted in premature termination of
             treatment or a medical device incident that could not be resolved during the conduct
             of study sNN0031-001 and sNN0031-002

          -  Inclusion in study sNN0031-002 and participation without development of clinically
             significant safety concerns defined as being device related SAE that resulted in
             premature termination or a medical device incident that could not be resolved during
             the conduct of study sNN0031-002

          -  Intact continuity of the SynchroMed® II pump and ICV-catheter infusion system as
             judged by X-ray of head and abdominal area

          -  An ICV catheter tip position that is similar to the catheter tip position at
             implantation in study sNN0031-001, as verified with an MRI not older than 3 months

          -  Verification of device function made as a comparison of pump actual residual volume
             to the anticipated residual volume as indicated by the programmer. Reference point
             will be the refill volume and programming of the pump made at first visit with saline
             refill in study sNN0031-002. Values within 25% of expected will be an indication that
             the pump is functioning properly

          -  Ophthalmologic examination with no clinically significant findings that imply safety
             concerns for this study such as retinal haemorrhage, signs for papillary oedema

          -  Females should either be post-menopausal (at least 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with follicle stimulating hormone
             levels &gt;40 mIU/mL), be surgically sterilised (bilateral oophorectomy without
             hysterectomy), or use adequate contraception (oral contraceptives, intrauterine
             device or double barrier contraception, i.e., condom + diaphragm, condom or diaphragm
             + spermicidal gel or foam) during the duration of the study

          -  The patient, with or without the help of a caregiver, must be capable of maintaining
             an accurate and complete symptom diary and to adhere to visit schedules

          -  The patient has been given written and verbal information about the study, has had
             the opportunity to ask questions about the study, and understands the time and
             procedural commitments

          -  The patient has provided written informed consent to participate in the study before
             any study-specific procedures are conducted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another clinical study that entails investigational drug or device
             treatment after participation in study sNN0031-001 or study sNN0031-002

          -  The patient has, since participation in study sNN0031-001, had functional
             neurosurgical treatment for PD (e.g., deep brain stimulation)

          -  Concurrent dementia with a score of 20 or lower on the MoCA-test

          -  Concurrent clinically significant depression with a score of 16 or higher on the
             MADRS rating scale, equivalent to moderate or severe depression.

          -  Exposure to neuroleptic drugs blocking dopamine receptors within 6 months from the
             baseline visit of this study

          -  History of structural brain disease including tumours and hyperplasia

          -  Ongoing or suspected primary or recurrent malignant disease

          -  History of increased intracranial pressure

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg
             diastolic.

          -  Completion of an MRI examination of the brain and cervical spinal cord within 3
             months prior to study start with finding of tumours or potential sources of
             pathological bleedings, or abnormality that may or would interfere with the
             assessments of safety or efficacy, in the judgment of the Investigator

          -  Presence of cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, implantable programmable
             intraspinal drug pumps, or any other device that may interfere or interact with the
             programmer

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters
             indicative of a medical condition requiring treatment which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, is not compatible with participation in the present study

          -  Ongoing medical condition that according to the Investigator would interfere with the
             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., severe
             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the patient to undergo
             study procedures (e.g., MRI), to maintain a patient diary or to give informed
             consent.

          -  Serological evidence of HBV, HCV or HIV.

          -  Tuberculosis (TB) as detected by positive findings in chest X-ray and microscopy of
             urine.

          -  Increased susceptibility to infections (e.g. malignancies, neutropenia,
             immunodeficient states, immunosuppressive therapy).
