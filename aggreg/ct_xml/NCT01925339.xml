    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different timings of restoring dental implants
      that are placed right after tooth extraction: The test group will have the provisional crown
      placed at the time of implant placement. The control group will have the tooth removed and
      the implant placed at the same appointment but restorations placed after 4 months. Both
      procedures currently are accepted methods for replacing missing teeth but direct comparisons
      of the two procedures are lacking. The results of this study should aid clinicians in
      selecting the best timing for restoring implants for their patients. The hypothesis is that
      immediate restoration might increase aesthetic outcomes.

    <textblock>
      A single center, randomized controlled, parallel-arm study is planned to investigate
      esthetic outcomes after immediate placement and restoration in the esthetic zone. Forty
      adult patients who have a hopeless maxillary anterior or premolar tooth, with intact
      adjacent teeth will be enrolled. A signed written informed consent will be obtained after he
      or she has been given verbal and written information describing the nature and duration of
      the study. Subjects will not be screened or treated until an informed consent has been
      obtained. Patient information will be protected according to the privacy regulations of the
      Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

      The enrolled patients will be randomly placed into one of two treatment groups, immediate
      implant placement and restoration group (IR) or the IIP + delayed restoration group (DR).
      For all patients, the hopeless tooth will be extracted atraumatically and an implant placed
      immediately. The decision will be made randomly to either restoring the implant immediately
      (Test group) with a provisional crown or restoring the implant at 4 months after implant
      placement (Control group). Outcome analyses will be performed until 1-year after
      restorations are placed and primarily evaluate clinical and radiographic parameters to
      determine the esthetic outcomes of immediately restored IIP implants, in comparison to those
      immediately placed but restored in a delayed approach. As a second aim, biomarkers related
      to hard and soft tissue healing will be evaluated.
