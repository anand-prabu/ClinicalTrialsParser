            "textblock": "Preterm infants are born with immature lungs and often require help with breathing shortly\n      after birth. This traditionally involves administering 100% oxygen. Unfortunately, delivery\n      of high oxygen concentrations leads to the production of free radicals that can injure many\n      organ systems. Term and near-term newborns deprived of oxygen during or prior to birth\n      respond as well or better to resuscitation with room air (21% oxygen) compared to 100%\n      oxygen. However, a static concentration of 21% oxygen may be inappropriate for preterm\n      infants with lung disease.Purpose of the study is to investigate if preterm neonates where\n      resuscitation is initiated with 21% fiO2 and adjusted to meet transitional goal saturations\n      (Limited oxygen strategy or LOX) would have less oxidative stress as measured by the\n      oxidative balance ratio of biological antioxidant potential/total hydroperoxide compared to\n      infants where resuscitation is initiated with pure oxygen and titrated for targeted\n      saturations of 85-94% (Traditional oxygen strategy or TOX). Secondary outcomes of interest\n      included need for other delivery room resuscitation measures, respiratory support and\n      ventilation/oxygenation status upon neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, survival\n      to hospital discharge, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and other short-term morbidities."
