      The purpose of this research study is to show that non-steroidal treatment with intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIg) can replace current systemic immunosuppressive therapy in cutaneous
      lupus erythematosis (CLE) patients.

    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this pilot project is to generate proof-of-concept data showing that
      treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) can replace current systemic
      immunosuppressive therapy in cutaneous lupus erythematosis (CLE) patients.  This project has
      relevant clinical implications due to the severe side effects of and lack of response to
      current therapies.

      From the review of literature, it can be postulated that:

        1. the beneficial effects of IVIg for patients with CLE should be prompt, with marked
           improvement within a few weeks;

        2. clinical improvement should last several weeks after the last infusion; and

        3. remission may be prolonged by maintenance IVIg therapy.

      Although this is only a non-controlled study, the investigator expects that IVIg will
      improve CLE, including those resistant to standard treatments. It is anticipated that
      treatment with IVIg will facilitate healing of extensive cutaneous lesions and achieve rapid
      remission.  Maintenance therapy with repeated monthly pulses of IVIg is expected to keep the
      disease in remission during the treatment-free follow up observational period. The results
      will provide the basis a multicenter randomized controlled study to identify which CLE
      subsets will benefit the most and which protocol will provide the optimal clinical outcome.

    <description>At clinic visits, the investigator will categorize the change in disease activity in each patient as improved, unchanged, or worse since the last visit. Estimated change in disease activity will be based on the investigator's subjective assessment of the patient's skin disease.</description>

    <description>Disease activity will be measured using the CLASI activity score. This score ranges from 0-70, with higher scores indicating more severe skin disease (see CLASI form below). This clinical assessment tool enables standardized assessments of response to therapy. The CLASI has two scores, as mandated by the FDA. The first describes the activity of the disease while the second describes the damage done by the disease. The CLASI has already been shown to have good content validity, addressing the most relevant aspects of CLE, as determined by an expert panel of dermato-rheumatologists (1). It also has good inter-rater and intra-rater reliability when used by either dermatologists or rheumatologists (2-5). Several clinical studies have demonstrated responsiveness in all subsets of CLE, including individual lesions, localized and generalized (6-8).</description>

    <description>All enrolled subjects will receive IVIg treatment following the protocol that proved to be efficacious in the treatment of patients with autoimmune blistering diseases as well as some patients with CLE. The drug will be administered at 500 mg/kg/day on consecutive days up to a total of 2 g/kg/month for 3 months in the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at University of California, Irvine.  After 3 months of treatment, IVIg will be discontinued and the subjects will be monitored for additional 6 months for a possible relapse. In the case of relapse, which is expected to occur in &lt;25% subjects, the subjects will be re-treated by the standard protocol.</description>
