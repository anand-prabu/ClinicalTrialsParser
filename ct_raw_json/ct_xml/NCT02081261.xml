  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is a major complication after cardiac surgery and
      has been reported to be associated with adverse outcome. There have been many studies
      reporting risk factor of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery, but the influence of
      perioperative variables related to anesthesia and perioperative medication has not been
      evaluated fully. The investigators attempt to evaluate the influence of preoperative
      medication, preoperative albumin level, uric acid concentration, anesthesia technique, use
      of hydroxy ethyl starch, blood glucose level, intraoperative medication, and hemodynamic
      variables during surgery on the incidence of acute kidney injury after coronary artery
      bypass graft.
