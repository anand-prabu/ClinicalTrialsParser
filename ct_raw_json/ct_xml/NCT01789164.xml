  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine if it is possible to assess Cerebrovascular
      Reactivity (CVR) to hypercapnia with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Such a
      method would be particularly helpful in traumatic brain injury (TBI), where objective
      measures are needed, and would greatly expand the capacity to make such assessments in
      standard clinical practice.

      The prospective study design will consist of two study groups; the experimental group and
      the control group. In the Experimental Group (Group 1) we will enroll adult participants
      with TBI with persistent post-concussion symptoms or abnormalities on neuropsychological
      testing. In Group 2 we will enroll adult participants to serve as age and gender-matched
      healthy controls. Our goal is to recruit 100 subjects total in two groups of age and gender
      matched subjects, as follows: TBI (n = 50) and non-TBI (n = 50).

      Participants in both groups will undergo NIRS testing with hypercapnia challenge, to measure
      the increase in hemodynamic flow signal during hypercapnia challenge via 2 methods, the
      breath holding and the Douglas bag methods.  We will test intersessional validity of the
      NIRS-hypercapnia challenge in the first 20 (10 TBI and 10 non-TBI) subjects who are willing
      to return for a second visit of repeat testing.

      The NIRS system is composed of 4 light sources and 10 detectors with a 16 point
      configuration system applied on the forehead of the subject. In our experiment, light
      intensity collected at each detector will be transformed into a signal related to the local
      concentrations of oxy- and de-oxyhemoglobin during the challenge. Each experiment will give
      a set of subject data, consisting of the peak amplitude and time-to-peak of the hemodynamic
      signals measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ALL participants (TBI and non-TBI) subjects Males and females, ages 18 to 60 years,
             inclusive Able to read, write, speak and understand English

          2. A history of TBI

          3. Persistent post-concussive symptoms, according to the DSM-IV Research

          4. Criteria for  Post-Concussional Disorder, including:

               -  Evidence from neuropsychological testing of difficulty in attention or memory.
                  (refers to neuropsychological testing done as a part of the patient's hospital
                  or rehabilitation care not as a part of screening for this study)

               -  Three or more of the following symptoms, which started shortly after the trauma
                  and persist for at least three months:

                    -  Fatigability

                    -  Disordered sleep

                    -  Headache

        Symptoms in criteria (a) and (b) must have their onset after trauma, or there was a
        significant worsening of pre-existing symptoms after trauma.
