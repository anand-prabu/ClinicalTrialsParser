Previous studies have shown that decisional aids (DAs) may improve knowledge,\n      physician-patient communication, decisional conflict, and patient satisfaction. However, no\n      study has evaluated the role of a decisional aid among women presenting for evaluation and\n      management of prolapse.   We would like to determine if a decision aid for prolapse\n      decreases the amount of decisional conflict women face when choosing a plan of care.\n\n      We hypothesize that there will be a difference in the level/amount of decisional conflict\n      between women who receive a DA and those who do not.  Specifically, we anticipate that women\n      randomized to receiving standard counseling and a DA with have less decisional conflict than\n      the cohort receiving standard counseling alone."

We routinely send a packet to all of our new patients.  Half of the\n      participants received a decision aid to supplement their information packet and the other\n      half received our routine informational packet. You will be asked to complete a set of 2\n      questionnaires.

The investigators will use the statement format of this scale in which patients respond to a series of Likert-scale statements using response categories of strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree, which are scored as 0-4, respectively, and added.  Based on previous research, scores will be tabulated and patients will be grouped as either having \"high level of decisional conflict\" versus \"low level of decisional conflict.\"\nValues will be assessed for normality and compared between groups (i.e. those receiving the DA versus those who did not).",
