In this regard, it might be appropriate to develop a simply applicable (a) and\n      effective (b) acupuncture regimen for the complementary support of fast-track anaesthesia.\n      Regarding practicability (a), it might be of interest to reduce the amount of necessary\n      acupuncture points. Trials have shown that single-point acupuncture is strong enough to\n      cause relevant clinical effects (Fleckenstein et al., 2009; Lee and Fan, 2009). In addition,\n      practicability means to reduce the amount of needling events; therefore the investigators\n      suggest the use of press needles, making complete peri-anaesthetic availability possible.\n      Regarding effectiveness (b), it has been reported that acupuncture at Governing Vessel 26\n      (Du-26) may be successful in shock resuscitation (Hsu et al., 2006). In combination with\n      other points it has been evaluated in a Chinese study improving the vegetative state after\n      operation of acute subdural hematoma (Zheng, 2005)."
