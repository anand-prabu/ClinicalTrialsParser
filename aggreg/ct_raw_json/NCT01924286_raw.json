            "textblock": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infection amongst HIV-infected patients\n      starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in developing countries and thus the most frequent\n      form of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Paradoxical TB-IRIS occurs in 8-\n      43% of patients starting ART while on TB treatment and results in morbidity,\n      hospitalisation, consumes health care resources and TB-IRIS may be fatal. We have previously\n      demonstrated in a clinical trial that prednisone reduces morbidity when used for treatment\n      of paradoxical TB-IRIS. This trial is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of\n      prophylactic prednisone (40mg/day for 2 weeks followed by 20mg/day for 2 weeks, started on\n      the same day as ART) in patients with TB who are identified as being at high risk for\n      paradoxical TB-IRIS (starting ART within 30 days of initiating TB treatment and CD4 <\n      100/\u03bcL). The trial will enroll 240 participants, randomised 1:1 (prednisone:placebo). The\n      primary endpoint is development of paradoxical TB-IRIS, defined using international\n      consensus case definitions. Secondary endpoints include time to IRIS event, severity of\n      IRIS, quality of life assessment, mortality and corticosteroids adverse events. The trial is\n      powered to determine a reduction in TB-IRIS events."

            "textblock": "Objective: To determine whether the addition of prednisone to the first 4 weeks of\n      antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of paradoxical TB-IRIS in HIV-infected\n      patients being treated for TB who are at high risk of developing TB-IRIS (CD4 <100 cells/\u03bcl\n      and starting ART within 30 days of TB treatment).\n\n      Design: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the incidence of\n      paradoxical TB-IRIS over the first 12 weeks of ART in participants who receive a 4 week\n      course of prednisone versus participants who receive a 4 week course of placebo.\n\n      Primary efficacy endpoint:\n\n      The development of paradoxical TB-IRIS within 12 weeks of starting ART (defined using the\n      International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) consensus case\n      definition).\n\n      Secondary efficacy endpoints:\n\n        1.

All-cause mortality\n\n        6.

Adverse events and severe adverse events ascribed to TB treatment, ART or\n           co-trimoxazole. This will include a pre-specified analysis of drug-induced liver injury\n           and drug rash. This assessment will include the number of treatment interruptions for\n           drug adverse events.\n\n       10. Discontinuation of either ART or TB treatment for > 5 days due to adverse events\n\n       11. Number of hospitalizations and total days hospitalized\n\n      Safety and tolerability endpoints:\n\n        1.

These will include hypertension, hyperglycaemia, hypomania/mania, depression,\n           acne, epigastric pain, upper gastro-intestinal bleeding, Cushingoid features, new\n           oedema and avascular bone necrosis.\n\n        2. Laboratory safety data: glucose, full blood count and electrolytes\n\n        3. Other infections (AIDS-related, bacterial, fungal and viral) and malignancies (Kaposi's\n           sarcoma)\n\n        4. All grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 adverse events (clinical and laboratory using the ACTG grading\n           system)\n\n      Sample size: 240 participants will be enrolled over 13 months. Each participant will be\n      followed for 12 weeks.\n\n      Population: HIV-infected, ART-na\u00efve adult (\u2265 18 years) patients diagnosed with active\n      tuberculosis who have a CD4 < 100 cells/\u03bcL and who start ART within 30 days of starting TB\n      treatment. Other inclusion criteria include: diagnosis of TB (smear, culture, Xpert MTB/RIF\n      test, histology or strong clinical and radiological evidence of TB with symptomatic response\n      to TB treatment), eligible for and consent to starting ART and written informed consent for\n      trial. Exclusion criteria include: Kaposi's sarcoma, pregnancy, TB meningitis or tuberculoma\n      at TB diagnosis (because these patients receive corticosteroids), known rifampicin-resistant\n      TB, being on corticosteroids for another indication within the past 7 days, on other\n      immunosuppressive medication within the past 7 days and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\n\n      TB treatment and ART: TB treatment will be prescribed and monitored by the clinical staff in\n      the local HIV-TB clinic. TB treatment will be given according to South African Department of\n      Health guidelines. This involves rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), ethambutol (E) and\n      pyrazinamide (Z) for 2 months followed by RH for 4 months. ART will be prescribed by the\n      clinical staff at the HIV-TB clinic according to South African Department of Health\n      guidelines. Standard first line ART in TB patients is tenofovir, emtricitabine (or\n      lamivudine) and efavirenz. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis will be prescribed to all patients\n      unless a contra-indication exists.\n\n      Intervention: Oral prednisone 40mg daily for 14 doses started on the first day that ART is\n      taken, followed by 20mg daily for 14 doses (or identical placebo). A total of 28 days of\n      study medication will thus be prescribed.\n\n      Follow-up: Patients will be screened once established on TB treatment, but before starting\n      ART. If the patient is eligible, written informed consent will be taken. There will be six\n      planned study visits that will be in relation to the start of ART: week 0 (the day ART is\n      initiated), week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 12. Patients will be seen at unscheduled\n      visits if clinical deterioration occurs. If paradoxical TB-IRIS is diagnosed this will be\n      treated with open label prednisone at clinician discretion if symptoms are moderate or\n      severe. If patients experience clinical complications (eg. TB-IRIS) follow-up will be\n      prolonged beyond week 12 in order to stabilize their condition before referral back to the\n      general TB-HIV clinical service for ongoing management.\n\n      Data monitoring: The trial will be monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring\n      Board (DSMB) comprising 3 independent researchers and an independent statistician. After an\n      initial meeting for agreeing on their Charter, the DSMB will meet twice (after 80 and 160\n      participants have completed follow-up) to review data quality and data with respect to\n      safety and trial endpoints. If there is evidence of harm related to study medication or\n      trial conduct the DSMB may advise the sponsor that trial enrollment should be stopped.\n\n      Clinical trial site: Khayelitsha Site B HIV-TB clinic (Ubuntu clinic)\n\n      Co-investigators:\n\n      Lut Lynen (Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium) Gary Maartens (University of\n      Cape Town) Robert J.
