Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Umbilical cord blood transplantation may be able to replace cells destroyed by\n      chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and\n      umbilical cord blood transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic cancer."

Determine the rates of hematologic and immune reconstitution in pediatric\n      patients with high risk hematologic malignancies in first remission or in second or\n      subsequent remission, and adult patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute\n      nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) in second or subsequent remission, who are undergoing high\n      dose chemoradiotherapy followed by unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation. II.\n      Determine the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in this setting. III. Determine whether\n      contamination of umbilical cord blood with maternal cells is a clinical problem in this\n      setting. IV. Describe the incidence of leukemic relapse in these patients after UCB\n      transplantation. V. Describe the incidence of serious infections and secondary\n      lymphoproliferative diseases following transplantation with UCB in these patients. VI.\n      Determine specifically whether larger recipients (greater than 40 kg) can be durably\n      engrafted with unrelated UCB, and determine whether nucleated cell or progenitor cell\n      content of the graft is predictive of hematological engraftment.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a back-up bone marrow harvest prior to treatment. Patients receive\n      9 fractions of total body irradiation (TBI) on days -9 to -5, followed by melphalan IV on\n      days -4 to -2 and antithymocyte globulin IV or methylprednisolone IV on days -3 to -1. If\n      TBI is not allowed, busulfan is substituted and administered orally every 6 hours for 4 days\n      on days -8 to -5. On day 0, patients receive umbilical cord blood infusion. Cyclosporine and\n      methylprednisolone begin on day -2 and continue for 6 months. Patients are followed\n      indefinitely for survival and late toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 48 patients will be accrued into this study within 4 years."
