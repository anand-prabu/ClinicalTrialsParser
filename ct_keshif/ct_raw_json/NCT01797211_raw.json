Changes in diet,\n      level of physical activity and behavior are well known key elements influence endothelial\n      function. Recent studies seem to show that Mediterranean diet has beneficial role on\n      cardiovascular risk. It could protect against the development of coronary heart disease also\n      through a possible effect on body weight and obesity.\n\n      At the best of our knowledge, the effect of Mediterranean diet on endothelial function in\n      obese subjects has not been definitely established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to\n      evaluate the impact of Mediterranean diet on anthropometric parameters (body weight, BMI and\n      waist circumference), lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein\n      cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)], triglycerides (TG),\n      fasting glucose and endothelium function, evaluated by FMD, in a group of obese and\n      overweight subjects. In particular, subjects were invited to follow a standard Mediterranean\n      diet for a short (3 months) or a longer (18 months) period. The specific role of some\n      components of Mediterranean diet (olive oil or non fried fish or nuts) was also\n      investigated."
