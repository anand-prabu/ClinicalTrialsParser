This is a randomized controlled trial, the population is\n      all students of baccalaureate nursing of EERP-USP, eighth period, 69 students in total; the\n      sample will be voluntary and composed for students that accept participate of study. The\n      intervention group (IG) will be submitted to simulation class and the control group (CG)to\n      exhibition-dialogued class, and practical activity in skill lab. The study will have 3\n      steps:\n\n        1. The participants will be recruited with letters and posters, randomized to IG or CG and\n           follow submitted to write pre-test.\n\n        2. The GI will submitted to simulation in laboratory and de CG classroom lecture-dialogued\n           follow of laboratory activity practice. The focus will be the airway management with\n           emphasis in LMA.\n\n        3. All participants will be submitted to write post test and follow to practice test in\n           simulation scenario, with medium-fidelity mannequin, which simulates human physiologic\n           conditions.\n\n      The scenario will have a appraiser with a checklist which performance scores of skills and\n      interventions observed.
