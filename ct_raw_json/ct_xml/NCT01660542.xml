      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase IV trial to assess the efficacy and safety of
      sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed
      by 4 cycles of docetaxel(Monotaxel®) in patients with breast cancer of ≥5cm in size or
      cytologically confirmed axillary lymph nodes metastasis.

    <description>Pathologic complete response is defined as the disappearance of all invasive cancer in the postsurgical breast and lymph node specimens after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Only residual intraductal carcinoma in the postsurgical breast specimen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also considered as the achievement of pathologic complete response.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically proven invasive breast cancer - the primary tumor size
             is at least 5cm or cytologically proven axillary node metastasis

          2. no evidence of systemic metastasis pathologically or radiologically

          3. age at the time of diagnosis between 20 and 70 years

          4. patients with previously untreated primary breast cancer including chemotherapy

          6. sufficient hematopoietic function (absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 1,500/mm3, platelet
             count of ≥ 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin of ≥ 10 g/dL)

          7. sufficient renal function (serum creatinine level of ≤ 1.5 mg/dL)

          8. sufficient liver function (total serum bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 times the upper normal
             limit; serum AST and ALT levels ≤ 1.5 times the upper normal limit; and serum
             alkaline phosphatase level ≤ 1.5 times the upper normal limit)

          9. sufficient cardiac function (normal electrocardiography within 1 month or LVEF&gt;50% by
             echocardiography or MUGA scan within 3 months)

          4. uncontrolled serious infection

          5. patients with psychiatric disease or epilepsy

          6. patients with clinically severe cardiac disease within 6 months such as atrial or
