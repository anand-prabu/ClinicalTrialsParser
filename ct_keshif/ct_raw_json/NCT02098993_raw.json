Prespecified feasibility criteria consists of the ability to enroll\n      potential study participants, which includes the timely notification of hospitalized\n      patients with ACS, the capacity to consent eligible individuals, and the ability to\n      appropriately randomize eligible patients within 24 hours of diagnosis. Additional\n      feasibility objectives involve ensuring appropriate eligibility criteria, proper\n      administration of the study drug, and the ability to completely and accurately collect\n      clinical data of interest. The final aim of our pilot study is to provide preliminary data,\n      with respect to treatment effect and variance, to allow sample size calculation in a larger\n      trial given the lack of data available to help guide this process. The investigators\n      hypothesize that the use of UFH in ACS will result in a decrease in the duration of\n      hospitalization and improve other clinical outcomes, such as the duration of hypoxemia and\n      duration of moderate to severe pain."
