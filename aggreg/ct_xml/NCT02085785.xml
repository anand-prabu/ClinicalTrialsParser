  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a program to help overweight and obese
      individuals with a lower extremity amputation (LEA) lose weight and become more physically
      active. We will randomize approximately 30 individuals to either a self-directed weight loss
      program (n=15) or a coached weight loss program (n=15).  The primary purpose of this pilot
      study is to determine if a home-based weight loss/physical activity (PA) intervention is
      feasible in individuals with a LEA.  MOVE-LEAP is a 20-week program that involves 11  phone
      calls from a health coach and a single home visit by a physical therapist.

      This pilot study aims to:

        1. test the feasibility of recruiting overweight/obese individuals with LEA into a
           randomized trial;

        2. assess whether the intervention can be delivered with high fidelity, and

        3. evaluate whether the intervention is acceptable to and safe as determined by
           participant feedback, participation and retention for outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive (1) a home visit by an exercise
      specialist and (2) a 20-week telephone-delivered weight loss program, modeled on the VA's
      Telephone Lifestyle Coaching Program (MOVE!TLC).  All participants (both the coached arm and
      self-directed arm) will be mailed a MOVE-LEAP packet [containing eating and physical
      activity logs, information on  how to set weight loss goals, suggestions for physical
      activity/exercise, dietary  guides, etc.), a MOVE-LEAP handout booklet, calories counting
      book, a pedometer, exercise DVD, and a flip-booklet with exercises (&quot;Exercise Guide for
      Persons with Limb Loss&quot;).  A bathroom scale will be provided for participants who do not
      already own one.

      Participants in the coached arm will receive a home visit by an exercise specialist. This
      visit will occur 1-3 weeks after randomization. The exercise specialist will assess the
      participant's capabilities and interest regarding physical activity as well as his/her home
      environment for physical activity.  Since each participant may have different physical
      capabilities and limitations, the type and intensity of physical activity will be tailored
      to each participant's preferences and their home and neighborhood/community environment and
      resources. If the participant is interested in performing physical activity outside their
      home, study staff will provide them with information about community resources for physical
      activities.

      Participants in the coached arm will receive 11 calls by a study health coach. During the
      phone calls (weekly initially and then every other week), the health coach will review
      progress and help the participant to set &quot;SMART&quot; goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable,
      Relevant and Time-limited) and will use motivational interviewing techniques to help the
      participant achieve those goals.  Motivational interviewing is a style of counseling meant
      to increase participant engagement through strategic use of open-ended questions, reflective
      listening and positive affirmations.  The study staff will review the participant's progress
      on his or her goals and help him or her problem solve to resolve challenges and modify goals
      as needed. During each session, the coach will discuss an educational topic relating to
      weight loss. Written materials on each topic are included the booklet.
