  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate behavioral
      intervention to reduce obesity levels and ultimately the risk of developing diabetes type II
      in immigrant Latino farm workers.  Workers enrolled in a 2:1 ratio by random allocation into
      an intervention or control arm of the study.  The intervention participants received weekly
      classes for 10 weeks with education on diabetes, diet and physical activity and practical
      exercises. Both control and intervention were measured for weight, waist circumference,
      fasting blood glucose and interviewed before and after the study intervention. The main
      hypothesis was that intervention, but not control participants, would experience reduction
      in body measurements after the intervention.

    <description>Waist circumference measured in both control and intervention participants using a standard protocol. Conducted before intervention started and again 2-3 weeks after the intervention sessions finished.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Fasting blood glucose was a voluntary assessment and therefore not conducted in all participants.  Blood glucose was assessed from a middle digit using a sterile lancet and Accu-Check Advantage Blood Glucose Meter. It was assessed before the start of the intervention and after completion in both controls and intervention participants.</description>

    <description>Intervention participants attended up to 10 educational sessions teaching them about diabetes, and modifiable lifestyle factors (behaviors) to reduce the risk of diabetes by controlling weight. Sessions were conducted by Promotoras using culturally sensitive and appropriate materials and themes. Group activities and support were also emphasized. The control participants like the intervention were measured and interviewed before and again after the intervention sessions, but received no educational instruction or materials.</description>
