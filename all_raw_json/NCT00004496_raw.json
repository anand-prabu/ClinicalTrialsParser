A cohort of 5 patients is infused at each dose level of alpha-MSH\n      until the minimum effective dose (MED) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) are determined.\n\n      Group 2:  Patients receive a single dose of the MED of alpha-MSH IV over 5 minutes at the\n      time anastomoses are complete.  Other patients receive alpha-MSH at the MTD.  Cohorts of 5\n      patients each are treated at the MED and the MTD.\n\n      Group 3:  Patients receive alpha-MSH as in group 2.  Additional dose levels are also tested."
