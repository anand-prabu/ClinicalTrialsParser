  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perhaps one of the most disturbing aspects of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the associated
      premature death. Oxidative stress has been observed in patients with CF and exercise
      intolerance has been shown to predict mortality in patients with CF, regardless of how
      healthy their lungs are.  A critical barrier to improving the quality of life and longevity
      in patients with CF is our lack of knowledge regarding the different reasons why patients
      with CF cannot exercise to the level of their peers. We have collected preliminary data to
      support our central hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to the impairment in blood
      vessel function at rest and during exercise which ultimately oxygen transport and delivery
      resulting in exercise intolerance.  Exercise is therapeutic medicine for patients with CF
      and this investigation represents a major breakthrough in the approach to begin
      understanding the physiological mechanisms which contribute to exercise intolerance in these
      patients.
