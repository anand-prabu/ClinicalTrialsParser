Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal interleukin-12 in\n      patients with Mullerian carcinoma (closed to accrual as of 8/23/01), gastrointestinal\n      carcinoma, or peritoneal mesothelioma (closed to accrual as of 8/23/01). II. Determine the\n      qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this regimen in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive intraperitoneal\n      interleukin-12 over 30 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for\n      up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients\n      with stable or responsive disease may receive an additional 6 courses. Patients receive\n      escalating doses of intraperitoneal interleukin-12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is established, additional patients are\n      accrued to receive interleukin-12 at the recommended dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2\n      years."
