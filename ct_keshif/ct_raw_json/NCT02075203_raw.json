The trial will be conducted at the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine\n      Initiative (SATVI) site in the Western Cape region of South Africa, where epidemiological\n      studies involving thousands of adolescents have been conducted over the last decade to\n      characterize rates of Mtb infection and active TB disease in this age group. Subjects will\n      be enrolled in two sequential cohorts and within each cohort subjects will be randomized in\n      a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either AERAS-404 or saline placebo on Days 0 and 56, or BCG Vaccine\n      SSI on Day 0. The first 90 subjects (30 from each arm) will form the Safety & Immunogenicity\n      Cohort and will be subject to more intensive collection of safety data, with data reviewed\n      by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), principal investigator and local medical monitor.\n      Selected immunogenicity assays, including whole blood intracellular cytokine staining (ICS),\n      will also be performed in this cohort. The remaining 900 subjects will be enrolled into the\n      Correlates Cohort. All 990 subjects in the study will be evaluated for safety and biomarker\n      outcomes, and for prevention of Mtb infection.\n\n      The primary Mtb infection endpoint will be QFT-GIT conversion from a negative to positive\n      test, using the manufacturer's recommended threshold of 0.35 IU/mL, at any time-point after\n      Day 84 and through end of follow-up for the primary endpoint. The 84-day 'wash-out' period\n      is stipulated in order to exclude subjects who may have already been Mtb infected, but not\n      yet converted their QFT-GIT test at screening, thus subjects who convert their QFT-GIT at\n      Day 84 will not be included in the analyses of prevention of Mtb infection."
