  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, only three radiotracers, (2-[18F]FA, 6-[18F]FA and [18F]AZAN), are available for
      studying α4β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α4β2-nAChR) in human brain using PET
      imaging. A crucial problem for 2-[18F] FA, 6-[18F] FA and ([18F] AZAN is low binding
      potential (BP) in extrathalamic (ET) regions, including hippocampus, cortex and caudate
      which have lower receptor densities than the thalamus. The importance of imaging
      ET-α4β2-nAChRs (ET-nAChR) has emerged from the post-mortem demonstration of altered
      densities of ET-nAChRs (but not thalamic nAChR) in neurodegenerative diseases and
      schizophrenia. PET imaging of ET-nAChR may prove to be useful in both detecting early
      changes and following functional deterioration in neurodegenerative diseases such as
      Alzheimers disease.  Furthermore, PET imaging of ET-nAChR may allow investigation and
      development of new therapies acting on the acetylcholine system.

      The imaging drawbacks of the presently available nAChR radioligands have initiated the
      development of radioligands with greater binding potential by several research groups.  The
      available pre-clinical data on our new radioligand [18F](-)-JHU86428 ([18F]XTRA) suggest
      that this radioligand is superior to 2-[18F]FA for quantitative PET imaging of α4β2-nAChR
      (Gao, J. Med. Chem,  2008). In baboon PET studies [18F]XTRA exhibits 200% greater brain
      uptake, 300% higher BPs and reaches steady-state in approximately 1.5 h in cortical regions
      post-bolus administration versus 6-8 h for 2-[18F]FA. In vitro binding assays shows greater
      binding affinity of XTRA and similar nAChR-subtype selectivity in comparison with 2-FA. Both
      ligands bind selectively with the β2-subtypes that are predominant nAChR subtypes in the
      mammal brain and display little binding affinity at ganglionic α3β4-nAChR.

      The current planned human protocol will be conducted to (1) determine brain distribution
      (brain uptake) and test the reproducibility (in test-retest design) of [18F]XTRA brain PET
      scans for validation of the radioligand; (2) generate estimates of the whole body and
      internal organ radiation absorbed doses from exposure to single iv administrations of
      [18F]XTRA in healthy human subjects; and (3) determine brain distribution of [18F]XTRA in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The population consists of healthy adults 18-85 years of age. There is no race or sex bias
        in our recruitment.

        a. Inclusion criteria.

          1. healthy volunteer, 18-80 years of age, and in portion 2, patient with Alzheimer's
             disease or patient with mild cognitive impairment (age 60-80 years)

          2. screening laboratory tests will be obtained for subjects within a 10-day period prior
             to the PET study and the results must be within normal limits for gender and age.
             These tests will be repeated with a 10-day window following the PET study.

          3. ECG conducted within a 10-day period prior to the PET study.  The ECG will be
