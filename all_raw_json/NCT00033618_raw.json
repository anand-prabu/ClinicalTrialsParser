To determine the response rate and toxicity of BMS-247550 given in two dosing schedules\n      in taxane-na\u00efve and taxane-exposed patients.\n\n      II. To provide information about the response rate and toxicity of BMS-247550 given in two\n      dosing schedules.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To measure surviving expression and correlate with the therapeutic responsiveness to\n      BMS-247550.\n\n      II. To determine the changes in tumor vascular density and endothelial cell apoptosis in\n      response to therapy and the correlation of these changes to outcome.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior taxane\n      therapy (yes vs no) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Arm II: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat\n      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      In both arms, patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR\n      if a minimum of 6 courses have been administered.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years."
