The present study has the character of a pilot study and\n      the results are intended to be used to develop a standardized protocol for imaging and\n      analysis of these corneal lesions. Based on this protocol, further studies investigating the\n      pathophysiology of corneal lesions or evaluating therapeutic success can be planned."
