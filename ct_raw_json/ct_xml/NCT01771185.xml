  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric bypass surgery resolves type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without the need for
      diabetes therapy in ~80% of patients. Moreover, improvement in insulin sensitivity and
      glucose homeostasis occurs within days after surgery before significant weight loss is
      achieved. This observation has led to the notion that bypassing the upper gastrointestinal
      (GI) tract has specific therapeutic effects on insulin action and glucose metabolism. In
      fact, both surgical and endoscopic procedures that bypass the upper GI tract are currently
      being studied in human subjects. Recently, a new surgical technique, duodenal-jejunal bypass
      surgery (DJBS), has been developed specifically to treat T2DM. Data from preliminary studies
      have shown that DJBS results in glycemic control in 87% of overweight and obese patients
      with T2DM.These subjects will undergo metabolic studies at the University Hospital in Sao
      Paulo before and after their surgical procedure. Washington University investigators will:
      1) provide technical support and guidance to the physicians performing the studies in
      Brazil, 2) process and analyze blood samples obtained from the study at the Washington
      University Center for Human Nutrition, and 3) be involved in analyzing the data and writing
      the final manuscripts. The effects of DJBS on the following clinical and metabolic
      parameters will be evaluated
