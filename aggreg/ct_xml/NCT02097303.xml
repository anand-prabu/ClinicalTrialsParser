      This is an open label study designed to examine the effects on concurrent administration of
      Radium Ra 223 dichloride and Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone in subjects with
      symptomatic castrate resistant prostate cancer and with bone metastases, in both the pre-
      and post- chemotherapy setting. Both medications are approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration for this indication.

      Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled to obtain 30 evaluable subjects.  All subjects
      will receive Radium Ra 223 dichloride every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses over 24 weeks and
      concurrent Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone for a minimum duration of 26 weeks.

      Subjects will be evaluated 30 days after the last dose of Radium Ra 223 dichloride.  All
      adverse events deemed to be study related will be followed until resolution.  Including
      screening, the total duration of the study is 32 weeks.

    <description>Radium Ra 223 dichloride - A targeted alpha particle-emitting pharmaceutical (a radiopharmaceutical drug) is a ready-to-use solution for intravenous injection containing the drug substance radium dichloride. The active moiety is the alpha particle emitting nuclide Ra-223, present as a divalent cation (223Ra2+) and Abiraterone Acetate - A CYP17 inhibitor, indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of subjects with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Administration of Abiraterone Acetate may result in mineralocorticoid-related adverse events (AEs), due to CYP17 inhibition.  Therefore, Abiraterone Acetate is administered in combination with Prednisone to reduce the frequency of these AEs.</description>
