    <textblock>
      Often the decision for chest tube removal or trial of chest tube clamping is based on
      subjective assessment. This can lead to delay in chest tube removal.  Recently, monitoring
      and recording of air leaks has been done using digital pleural drainage devices.  This
      provides us with objective and continuous recording of air leaks as well as changes in
      pleural pressure. Our hypothesis is that the use of the ATMOS digital pleural drainage
      system will result in shorter hospital stay in comparison to traditional pleural drainage
      systems.

      Technology has become a driving force in surgery.  From robotics to digital monitoring of
      oxygen saturation, it has revolutionized the way we care for patients.  However, new
      technology comes at a cost to our healthcare system. It is therefore important to ensure
      that new devices actually improve outcomes.  One example of this is minimally invasive
      surgery, which decreases morbidity to patients and reduces length of hospital stay.
      Unfortunately, despite this advance in lung surgery, delays in discharge from hospital are
      still prevalent due to prolonged air leaks.  Many intra-operative methods have been explored
      in order to limit this issue with underwhelming success.  This is why we are proposing a
      randomized controlled trial comparing a digital pleural collection system by ATMOS to
      traditional pleural collection devices by Atrium.

      Our research question is: Can the use of a digital air leak monitoring system decrease
      hospital stay in patients undergoing anatomical lung resection when compared to traditional
      pleural drainage systems?

    <description>The primary objective of this study will be the length of hospital stay from the day of surgery until the day of hospital discharge.  The average length of hospital stay is 7 days.
A subgroup analysis will be done to determine the impact of a video-assisted operative approach on length of stay and duration of chest tube drainage in comparison to thoracotomy.</description>
