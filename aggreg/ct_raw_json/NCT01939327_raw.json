            "textblock": "The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is steadily increasing worldwide. At present,\n      it is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer in France, with 10 000 estimated new cases\n      and 5200 deaths annually. An increasing NHL incidence at a rate of 3-4% per year was\n      observed for the 1970s and 1980s. This stabilized in the 1990s, nevertheless still with an\n      annual rise of 1-2%, resulting in almost a doubling of the NHL incidence during last 40\n      years. This rise has been noted worldwide, particularly in elderly persons >55 years.\n      Increases in high-grade NHL and extranodal disease are predominant. There is about 80% of\n      B-cell histology, approximately 90% of follicular lymphomas and about 70% of aggressive\n      lymphoma patients present with disseminated disease at diagnosis. The prognosis of NHL\n      depends on the histological type, stage and treatment. Indolent lymphomas have a relatively\n      good prognosis with survival time as long as 10 years, but they are usually incurable in\n      advanced stages. Aggressive NHL constitutes about 50% of all cases of NHL in Western Europe.\n      Approximately 50 - 60% of these patients can be cured with immuno-chemotherapy regiments.\n      Subsequently, almost 50% of patients will eventually relapse or become refractory to\n      treatment. The prognosis for patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive NHL is\n      generally poor. The response rates to salvage therapy regimens range from 20 to 40%.\n      Patients who present with refractory disease have the worst prognosis, with a median\n      survival of less than six months. Only a minority of patients can be given high dose\n      chemotherapy, the majority being ineligible due to disease progression.\n\n      By modulating the immune system through dendritic cells and NK cells, by changing the\n      cytokine milieu, and by their anti-angiogenic effects, IMiDs in combination with mabthera\n      (rituximab) resulted in augmented in vitro and vivo antitumor effects against B-cell\n      lymphoma.\n\n      As concerns the timing of administration and doses of medications, phase I/II studies are\n      ongoing with R-CHOP in combination with Revlimid (Lenalidomide) in DLBCL. The latest\n      presentation is by Nowakowski et al. at ASCO meeting in June 2010. This study determined the\n      maximum tolerated dose of Revlimid(Lenalidomide)administered on days 1-10 with standard\n      R-CHOP (R2-CHOP). NO DLT was found and 25 mg of Revlimid(Lenalidomide)was the recommended\n      dose for phase II with enrollment of 32 patients. These encouraging results permit to\n      introduce in our much less toxic protocol 25 mg of Revlimid(Lenalidomide)as initial dose,\n      with progressive reduction in case of toxicity.\n\n      As regards the dose and timing of Mabthera(Rituximab), in DLBCL it was traditionally used as\n      a single 375 mg/m2 injection/cycle. Pre-clinical data suggests that for the optimal NK\n      enhancement Revlimid(Lenalidomide)must be administrated several days (approx. 7 days) before\n      Mabthera(Rituximab)injection. So, our protocol provides Mabthera(Rituximab)IV administration\n      at day 7 of Revlimid(Lenalidomide).\n\n      Performed parallel biological investigation of NK status will permit to confirm this\n      hypothesis with possible correction of timing and number of administrations of\n      Mabthera(Rituximab)par cycle."
