Fertilization will be achieved by standard IVF or\n      intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Fertilized eggs will be cultured in 6% CO2, 5% O2, 89% N2\n      atmosphere in microdrops. In the treatment group EmbryoGen culture medium (EG, Origio,\n      M\u00e5l\u00f8v, Denmark) will be adopted throughout the culture period. In the control group,\n      inseminated oocytes will be cultured in standard culture conditions, i.e. IMS1 medium (ISM1,\n      Origio, M\u00e5l\u00f8v, Denmark), maintaining unchanged all other culture conditions.\n\n      Procedures of embryo transfer, will be carried out on day 2 using EmbryoGen or ISM1\n      respectively. The endometrial support will be the same in the two groups."
