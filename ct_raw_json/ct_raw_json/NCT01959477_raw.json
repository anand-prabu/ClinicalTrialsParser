Giving chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer\n      cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are\n      collected from the patient's peripheral blood or bone marrow and stored. The stem cells are\n      then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the\n      chemotherapy. Monitoring the dose of busulfan may help doctors deliver the most accurate\n      dose and reduce toxicity in patients undergoing stem cell transplant."

To compare the incidence of adverse events including mucositis, liver toxicity, seizures,\n      and pulmonary toxicity with TDM of once daily IV busulfan compared to historic controls.\n\n      II. To compare the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), with TDM of once daily IV\n      busulfan compared to historic controls.\n\n      III. To determine the proportion of patients who would not have achieved desired busulfan\n      level with weight-based busulfan dosing and therefore required TDM.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days -9 to -6, etoposide IV\n      continuously over 24-36 hours on days -5 and -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 4 hours on\n      days -3 and -2.
