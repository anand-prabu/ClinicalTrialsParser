Retrospective record reviews in\n      several countries have shown that 2,9% to 16,6% of patients in acute hospitals experience\n      one or more AEs. A patient with an AE may require a higher level of care.  Although all AEs\n      are important, preventable AEs that result in an upgraded level of patient care are of\n      particular concern. In this study it's defined as an unplanned admission to intensive care\n      unit (ICU) or a Mobile Emergency Team (MET) intervention. The objectives of this study are\n      to determine the incidence of (preventable) adverse events requiring ICU admission or MET\n      intervention and to assess the level of harm of each AE."
