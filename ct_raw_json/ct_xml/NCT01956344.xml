    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to measure changes in brain activity with functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after cognitive-behavioral therapy for
      compulsive hoarding. Cognitive-behavioral therapy aims to help people change the thoughts
      and behaviors that maintain symptoms of hoarding. The investigators intend to enroll
      approximately 80 people with hoarding disorder and 40 people with no psychiatric disorder,
      between the ages of 20 and 60, for this study. The investigators believe that after
      treatment there will be changes in the brain activity of individuals with compulsive
      hoarding.

      The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve clinical outcomes for Hoarding
      Disorder (HD), a common and potentially debilitating condition that poses a severe public
      health burden. The PI has developed and tested a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that
      appears moderately effective, although there is clear room for improvement. In the present
      study, the investigators propose to merge this line of research with the PI's recent
      NIH-supported neuroimaging research that points to specific functional abnormalities in
      regions of interest (ROIs) related to cognitive and affective decisionmaking processes.
      Patients with HD n = 80) will be randomized to CBT or wait list (WL). At pre-treatment,
      mid-treatment, and post-treatment, patients will undergo functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) during an acquiring and discarding decision-making task that has been used
      successfully in the investigators' previous work. In addition, patients will complete a
      number of laboratory tasks designed to assess decision-making capacity and impairment. A
      group of healthy control (HC) participants (n = 40) will also complete these measures as a
      normative control group. The primary aim of the proposed study is to determine the extent to
      which the observed patterns of neural activity in HD change following CBT. Under this aim,
      the investigators predict that HD patients (vs.HCs) will show greater hemodynamic activity
      in ROIs associated with cognitive and affective aspects of decision-making. The
      investigators further predict that HD patients receiving CBT (vs. WL) will show decreased
      activity in those ROIs, and will no longer differ from HCs following CBT. A secondary aim of
      the proposed study is to determine the relationship between change in activity in brain
      regions of interest and hoarding-related symptoms and impairments. The investigators expect,
      that hemodynamic activity in the target ROIs will correlate with symptoms of HD and with
      performance on decision-making tasks; and that change in brain activity will correspond to
      both symptom and mechanism changes over the course of treatment. Finally, an exploratory aim
      is to explore, using both data-driven and model-constrained approaches, patterns of
      pre-treatment neural activity that predict response to CBT. The investigators predict that
      among treated HD patients, pre-treatment activity in the target ROIs will correlate
      significantly with HD symptom change from pre- to posttreatment. Results of the proposed
      study are expected to elucidate the neural mechanisms of successful response to CBT
      treatment for hoarding patients, and to set the stage for further treatment development and
      possible improvements in outcome for this disorder.

    <description>The CGI is a widely used measure of global symptom severity (CGI-S) and symptom improvement after treatment (CGI-I). On the CGI-S the scale ranges from 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (extreme symptoms). On the CGI-I the scale ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The CGI can be used in both a self-report and clinician administered version and this study utilizes both formats.</description>
