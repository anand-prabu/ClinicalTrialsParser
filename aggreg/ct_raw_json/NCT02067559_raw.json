(2) The investigators hypothesize that compared to participants in\n      the psychoeducation and TAU groups, those subjects exposed to an ICU diary, and those\n      exposed to both ICU diary + psychoeducation conditions, will have significantly reduced\n      rates of PTSD at follow-up.

Patients will be randomized\n      to 4 different conditions (1) treatment as usual (TAU) (2) ICU diary (3) psychoeducation (4)\n      ICU diary + psychoeducation. The ICU diary will be created and maintained by nurses and\n      family members for each patient randomized to condition (2) and (4), and will be given to\n      patients by a research nurse upon discharge from the ICU. The patients in conditions (3) and\n      (4) will receive a psychoeducational brochure detailing general treatment and sedation\n      patients receive in the ICU, and the psychological symptoms such as depression and PTSD that\n      can occur after a stay in the ICU. This brochure will also be sent to their follow-up\n      physician. Patients in all conditions will be assessed at one week post-ICU for recollection\n      of delusional memories using ICU Memory Tool (ICUMT), at one- and three-month post-ICU for\n      baseline PTSD symptoms using Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), a commonly used measure\n      of PTSD symptomatology, as well as measures of anxiety/depression, social support, and\n      general health. At one and three month follow-up, the investigators will also ask patients\n      if they had contact with their health care providers/follow-up physicians, sought mental\n      health treatment, their general impressions of the intervention they received (diary,\n      psychoeducation, both), and whether/how often they reviewed the document (if in conditions\n      2-4). The investigators will ascertain feasibility from the health care provider and family\n      perspective by appending a short questionnaire to the diary, to be filled out each time an\n      entry is made."
