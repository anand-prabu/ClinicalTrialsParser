This has not previously been evaluated in patients\n      receiving antiHER2 therapy alone and as such is novel and potentially practice changing. The\n      results from this phase 2 biomarker study will be used to plan a randomized study using a\n      predefined cut point for SUV decline such that the investigators can further attempt to\n      identify a group of individuals with HER2-positive early breast cancer who do not require\n      cytotoxic chemotherapy in addition to anti-HER2 agents. This non-invasive biomarker approach\n      will be of great interest to breast cancer oncologists and patients by facilitating a\n      personalized approach to managing patients with HER2-positive disease that will undoubtedly\n      spare toxicity and reduce the costs associated with anti-cancer strategies, without\n      compromising efficacy."

Note:  If there are any imaging concerns that the patient may not be\n             suitable for quantitative PET/CT (e.g., a metallic device directly overlies the\n             breast), discussion with the local and central radiologists is required to confirm\n             eligibility for the trial.  Also, it is expected that subjects have all PET/CT\n             imaging done on pre-qualified machines for the study; if baseline imaging done on\n             another machine, please contact the Protocol Chair/designee for guidance prior to\n             confirming eligibility.\n\n          -  The patient, if of childbearing potential, is willing to use effective, non-hormonal\n             contraception while on treatment and for at least 6 months following the last dose of\n             therapy.\n\n          -  Patient understands the study regimen, its requirements, risks, and discomforts, and\n             is able and willing to sign an informed consent form.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Received prior or ongoing local (e.g radiation) or systemic treatment (chemotherapy\n             or endocrine therapy) for the current breast cancer.
