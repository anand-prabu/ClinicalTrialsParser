  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how difficult life-events that women experienced
      during their childhood might affect their babies.

      Women who are asked to participate in this study will fill out forms about their physical
      and mental health, have 3D ultrasounds of their baby's adrenal gland, have their stress
      responses measured and have their baby's development and stress responses assessed.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of maternal psychosocial stress and
      physiologic arousal on fetal adrenal gland volume across pregnancy. Maternal stress may have
      an adverse impact on the developing fetus by causing abnormal programming of the fetal
      Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which could lead to medical and behavioral health
      problems later in life. Non-invasive measurements of fetal adrenal gland volume by 3-D
      ultrasound may allow us to understand if maternal stress can impact fetal adrenal gland
      size. In addition, the investigators can begin to discern whether fetal adrenal size has
      behavioral ramifications for the offspring through assessment of the infants HPA axis
      response to novelty. This study presents a non-invasive, novel approach to understanding the
      impact of maternal stress on fetal and infant developments.

Adverse Childhood Events (ACE) Questionnaire;
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS);
A general health and demographic questionnaire.
All women who are screened will be asked if they would be willing to allow the study team to access their delivery report.
Women who do not list any adverse childhood events will be invited to continue in the study as part of the Women without Prepubertal Adversity cohort. We aim to have 125 women in this cohort.</description>
