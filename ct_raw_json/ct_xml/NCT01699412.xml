  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing
      the topical treatment with clobetasol or dexamethasone for symptomatic oral lesions of
      chronic graft-versus-host disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with symptomatic oral lesions of cGVHD were included in the study. Exclusion
      criteria were patients with 12 years or less of age, history of allergy to any of the
      studied medications and patients already under other topical treatment for oral lesions of
      cGVHD. Patients were randomly assigned between two study groups: one group rinsed with a
      solution of clobetasol propionate 0.05% associated to nystatin 100,000 UI/mL; and another
      group rinsed with a solution of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/ml associated to nystatin 100,000
      UI/mL. Patients were instructed to use the solution 3 times a day, during 1 minute, for 28
      days. Clinical exams were performed at baseline and after 28 days. Patients were evaluated
      by an oral medicine expert, previously calibrated for evaluation of oral cGVHD lesions. Oral
      lesions of cGVHD were diagnosed according to NIH 2005 criteria, and graded according to the
      modified oral mucositis rating scale. Evaluation of the symptoms of the oral mucosa and of
      xerostomia were performed through visual analogue scale. Samples for fungal culture were
      obtained  before and after the topical treatment. Results were submitted to a descriptive
      analysis. Chi-square was used for the comparison of categorical variables. Mann-Whitney and
      Wilcoxon tests were used for the comparison of measurable data inter and intra-groups,
      respectively. Significance level was set at 5%.
