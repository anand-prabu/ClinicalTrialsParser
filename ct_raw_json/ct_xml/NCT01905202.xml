  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secretrol administered over a 6 month period to patients with Barrett's Esophagus will be
      safe and well tolerated. Further, pH control will be evaluated in the distal esophageal
      mucosa and just below the squamocolumnar junction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A majority of patients with Barrett's esophagus have poor distal esophageal pH control.
      Such patients frequently receive more than one dose of PPI per day in an attempt to improve
      esophageal pH control.  Nocturnal pH control is notably difficult to achieve in many
      patients suffering from Barrett's esophagus.  Recently, adverse effects have been associated
      with prolonged PPI use (defined as 1 year or longer).  These include hypomagnesemia, bone
      fractures, Clostridium difficile induced diarrhea.  High dose PPI as well as very high dose
      PPI usage (such as that used in hypersecretory conditions) has generally not been found to
      produce a different side effect or tolerability profile in humans.  This study will evaluate
      the effects of Secretrol on tolerability, adverse effects and pH control of the distal
      esophagus and just below the squamocolumnar junction.
