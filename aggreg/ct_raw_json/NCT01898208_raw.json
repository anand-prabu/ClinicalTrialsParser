To test this hypothesis we\n      propose a prospective, randomized controlled study comparing outcomes among patients with\n      positive blood cultures who receive either: Standard culture and antimicrobial\n      susceptibility testing (AST) of positive blood culture bottles as is done today (control),\n      standard culture and AST of positive blood culture bottles plus the FilmArray Blood Culture\n      ID Panel (intervention group 1), or standard culture and AST of positive blood culture\n      bottles plus the FilmArray Blood Culture ID Panel testing along with expert infectious\n      diseases phone consultation (intervention group 2). In both intervention groups, results of\n      the FilmArray test will be communicated by phone to the primary service, along with\n      templated comments about optimal antimicrobial therapy, based on the result. (Templated\n      comments will also be used in the control group). In intervention group 2, an infectious\n      diseases pharmacist or physician will provide patient-specific recommendations to modify\n      antimicrobial therapy, if appropriate, based on microbiology results and clinical\n      information obtained through medical record review and discussion with the primary service."
