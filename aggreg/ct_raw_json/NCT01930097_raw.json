A dual-hormone closed-loop system would\n      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.\n\n      The objective of this project is to assess whether a dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would\n      alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D)\n      without a significant degradation in post-meal glucose control.\n\n      Our primary hypothesis is that meal-announcement strategy (pre-meal CHO-independent bolus)\n      is equivalent to meal-and-carbohydrate-announcement strategy (full CHO-matching bolus)\n      during closed-loop regulation of glucose levels in adults with T1D. Our secondary hypothesis\n      is that closed-loop strategy with meal-announcement strategy (pre-meal CHO-independent\n      bolus) or meal-and-carbohydrate-announcement strategy (full CHO-matching bolus) is better\n      than conventional pump treatment in regulation of glucose levels in adults with T1D."
