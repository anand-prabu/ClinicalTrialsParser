  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that an acute bout of aerobic exercise positively effects cognition,
      mainly executive functioning; however the effect is not observed among all people and it is
      not clear whether only aerobic exercise can produce this effect or possibly also resistant
      exercise.  The main purpose of our study is to examine whether genetic variation is a
      moderator of this effect and whether resistant exercise is comparable to aerobic exercise in
      improving cognition following a single bout of exercise.

    <description>Genetic variation will be analyzed by extraction of genomic DNA from blood leukocytes, using a salting out procedure, and then by using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment lengths polymorphism (PCR-RELP) methods for detection of single nucleotide polymorphism.  A mutation will be discriminated by digestion with specific restriction endonucleases.</description>
