  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is currently estimated that above 50% of new cancer cases are diagnosed in the elderly
      population[1].  With the increased life expectancy in the industrialised countries, the
      incidence of head and neck cancers has significantly increased in the last decade with rates
      estimated between 24-40% in patients over 70 years old [2-4]. It is estimated that with the
      improvement in quality of life and treatment modulation, the incidence will continue to rise
      in the coming years. Because the current available prospective studies often exclude
      patients above 65 or 70 years old, the data and guidelines on head and neck treatment for
      these patients population remain limited.

      Treatment of elderly patients with advanced stage III-IV oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma
      with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) using RapidArc® or Helical Tomotherapy® at a
      dose of 70 Gy in 33 fractions to the PTV (GTV) and 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions to the first
      disease-free lymphatic relay bilaterally as well as a combination Cisplatin chemotherapy at
      a reduced dose.

    <description>Obtain a locoregional control that is similar to historical data, therefore above 90%, while decreasing toxicity rates related to treatment in an elderly population at risk. We aim to recruit 10 patients for a confidence interval of 72 to 96% on the locoregional control rate. Kaplan-Meier curves will be obtained to calculate the locoregional control rate for these patients. Analysis will be conducted after each group of 5 patients. If a recurrence is document in 1 patient or more outside the CTV in each 5 patients group, the study will be interrupted.</description>

             proven by biopsy.

             2. Age ≥70 years but less than 80 years 3. Score ≤ 14 at the G8 questionnaire and a
             score deficit in ≥2 aspects of the SCGA without contra-indication CTRT (formal

             investigations:

               1. Medical history and physical examination within 28 days of enrolment to the
                  study.

               2. PET-CT-scan of the neck and MRI of the neck within 6 weeks of enrolment to the
                  study.

               3. CT-Chest or PET scan 6. Performance status: ECOG 0-2 7. Adequate renal, liver
