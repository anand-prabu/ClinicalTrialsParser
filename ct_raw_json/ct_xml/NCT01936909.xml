    <textblock>
      The RED-HART is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study of Anakinra (IL-1
      blocker) in patients with recently decompensated heart failure to determine the safety and
      efficacy in terms of aerobic exercise capacity and ventilatory efficiency measured with a
      cardiopulmonary exercise test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All 6 criteria need to be met for enrollment of the patient in the study

          1. Primary diagnosis for hospitalization is decompensated heart failure established as
             the finding at admission of all 2 conditions listed below:

               1. dyspnea or respiratory distress or tachypnea at rest or with minimal exertion;

               2. evidence of elevated cardiac filling pressure or pulmonary congestion (at least
                  one of the conditions must be met);

                    -  pulmonary congestion/edema at physical exam OR chest XRay;

                    -  plasma BNP levels ≥200 pg/ml;

                    -  invasive measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure &gt;18 mmHg or
                       of   pulmonary artery occluding pressure (wedge) &gt;16 mmHg.

          2. The patient has a prior documentation of impaired left ventricular systolic function
             (ejection fraction &lt;50%) at most recent assessment by any imaging modality (within 12
             months).

          3. The patient is now clinically stable and meets standard criteria for hospital
             discharge as documented by all the 3 conditions listed below:

               1. absence of dyspnea or pulmonary congestion/distress at rest;

               2. absence of pitting edema in the lower extremities, or in any other region;

               3. stable hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, heart rate).

          4. The patient is of age ≥21 years old, and is willing and able to provide written
             informed consent.

          5. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol (i.e. self administration
             of the treatment, and exercise protocol).

          6. The patient has screening plasma C-reactive protein levels &gt;2 mg/L.

        Exclusion Criteria Subjects will not be eligible if they meet any of the following 15
        exclusion criteria.

          1. The primary diagnosis for admission is NOT decompensated heart failure, including
             diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, hypertensive urgency/emergency, tachy- or
             brady-arrhythmias.

          2. Concomitant clinically significant comorbidities that would interfere with the
             execution or interpretation of the study including but not limited to acute coronary
             syndromes, uncontrolled hypertention or orthostatic hypotension, tachy- or
             brady-arrhythmias, acute or chronic pulmonary disease or neuromuscular disorders
             affecting respiration.

          3. Recent (previous 3 months) or planned cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT),
             coronary artery revascularization procedures, or heart valve surgeries.

          4. Previous or planned implantation of left ventricular assist devices or
             heart-transplant.

          5. Chronic use of intravenous inotropes.

          6. Recent (&lt;14 days) use of immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory drugs (not including
             NSAIDs).

          7. Chronic inflammatory disorder (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis,
             systemic lupus erythematosus).

          8. Active infection (of any type);

          9. Chronic/recurrent infectious disease (including HBV, HCV, and HIV/AIDS).

         10. Prior (within the past 10 years) or current malignancy.

         11. Any comorbidity limiting survival or ability to complete the study.

         12. End stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy.

         13. Neutropenia (&lt;2,000/mm3) or Thrombocytopenia (&lt;50,000/mm3).

         14. Pregnancy.

         15. Angina, arrhythmias, or electrocardiograph (ECG) changes that limit maximum exertion
             during cardiopulmonary exercise testing obtained during the baseline testing.
