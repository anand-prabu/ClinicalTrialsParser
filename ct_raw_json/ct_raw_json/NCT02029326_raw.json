This allows assessment of multiple TKI treatment targets, their activation\n      status, as well as down stream signaling proteins using very tiny amount of tissue that can\n      be obtained by FNA or CTCs.\n\n      We planned this study to explore biomarkers predictive of clinical response to\n      cetuximab-based treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer using the Prometheus Platform. We\n      will also elucidate signal transduction pathway attributable to cetuximab resistance,\n      monitor changes in the RTK activation status during cetuximab treatment using circulating\n      tumor cells and analyze correlation between the quantity of circulating tumor cells and\n      treatment response to cetuximab."
