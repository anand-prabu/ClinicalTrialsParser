            "textblock": "The goal of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a consequent anti-CD20\n      therapy with the antibody ofatumumab in the context of allogeneic HCT. Allogeneic HCT itself\n      is not a study intervention and is triggered by the availability of an HLA-compatible stem\n      cell donor. The study is divided into an induction part and a maintenance part. During\n      induction where the antibody is combined with high dose dexamethasone, the main goal is to\n      reduce the tumor load prior to allogeneic HCT. Patients who achieved disease control (CR, PR\n      and SD) by the antibody proceed to maintenance therapy with the antibody. Patients with\n      progressive disease go off study. The idea behind maintenance therapy is that ofatumumab may\n      contribute to tumor control early after allogeneic stem cell transplantation while T-cell\n      based graft-versus leukemia effects are still not fully established. External tumor control\n      could lower the pressure to taper immunosuppressive drugs early after transplantation and\n      could thereby indirectly contribute to better GVHD-prophylaxis. Furthermore, anti-CD20\n      antibodies have proven activity in the treatment of chronic GVHD. In summary, the concept of\n      a consequent CD20 blockade in the context of allogeneic transplantation could result in\n      better leukemic control and better GVHD prophylaxis, which is a highly attractive goal."
