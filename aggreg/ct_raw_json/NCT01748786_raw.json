The\n      mindfulness training program is expected to produce greater day-to-day improvements than the\n      education condition in individuals' efficacy for coping with pain and stress, positive and\n      negative affect, and positive engagement in social relations assessed via online diaries\n      completed each evening during the intervention period."
