  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to explore the effect of adalimumab on the fecal
      Calprotectin level of UC (Ulcerative Colitis) patients and the correlation with their
      general well-being (QoL), work ability and disease activity.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, observational study in which Humira (adalimumab) is prescribed
      in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with
      regards to dose, population and indication. The assignment of the patient to a Humira
      containing regimen has to be decided in advance and has to be current practice. The
      prescription of Humira is clearly separated from the decision to include the participant in
      this study.

             tuberculosis].

          -  Previous therapy with TNF-alpha (Tumor necrosis factor alpha) blocker

          -  no signed written authorization to use data

          -  Contraindication to adalimumab therapy according to the Summary of Product
