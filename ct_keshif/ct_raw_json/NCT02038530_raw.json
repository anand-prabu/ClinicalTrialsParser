The new diagnostic\n      strategy is designed to reduce the use of ultrasound testing on the day of presentation, and\n      reduce repeat ultrasound testing a week after an initial normal test. Less ultrasound\n      testing will be performed because: i) more patients will have deep vein thrombosis excluded\n      by combinations of Clinical Pretest Probability and D-dimer results on the day of\n      presentation; and, ii) in those who still need an ultrasound, a repeat ultrasound a week\n      after a normal result will only be performed if the D-dimer result is markedly abnormal at\n      initial presentation. The safety of this management strategy will be established by\n      demonstrating a very low rate of proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism during\n      90 days follow-up in patients who had anticoagulant therapy withheld in response to negative\n      diagnostic testing. Diagnostic test utilization will be assessed. All clinical outcomes will\n      be adjudicated by a central independent adjudication committee that will be blind to initial\n      D-dimer measurements and patient management."
