NITFBUT was evaluated noninvasively with a Tearscope. One eye from each participant was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye contributed to the analysis.  The percentage of participants with a lengthening in tear film break up time relative to baseline is reported. A positive value indicates an improvement in film stability, which may improve dry eye symptoms in dry eye sufferers.",
