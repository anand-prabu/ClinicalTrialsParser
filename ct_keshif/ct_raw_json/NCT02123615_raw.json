ASIS device correctly,\n      automatically, and consistently delivers therapeutic agents, yet requiring little skill of a\n      practitioner - providing the steady and safe infusion into subdermal bloodless space of\n      virtually any injectable product in addition to Botox, including GAMMAGARD LIQUID, Enbrel,\n      Insulin, and Fillers, etc. According to the FDA, \"This innovation will have major impact on\n      the healthcare industry.\""

            "textblock": "Aim 1 would require 6 months, to demonstrate ASIS device's consistent performance on 60\n      subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency (PI), and the particular skin affected by this\n      disease.\n\n      30 subjects will receive Gadolinium subcutaneously, and 30 subjects will receive Gadolinium\n      subdermally with ASIS device. An MRI will be taken promptly after Gadolinium injection, as\n      starting reference, to which subsequent MRI taken at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs later will be\n      compared for Persistent %. Since there isn't a way to measure level of Gadolinium within it,\n      or any other (e.g.\n\n      GAMMAGARD) for that matter, at least the Prolongation of Gadolinium may be approximated by\n      the greater or longer Persistent % on MRI. However, this approximation can only work if the\n      variables are minimized to the same population with Primary Immunodeficiency (PI), and the\n      particular skin affected by it. Case in point, Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) patients are\n      prone to infection, and tend to have scared skin with less vascularity, so expectantly will\n      have prolonged Gadolinium subcutaneously Persistent %, which will be very different from the\n      skin of normal patients, while the Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % may or may not\n      change. Therefore, the Relative Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally\n      over that of total Persistent % subcutaneously, will be different and very specific for the\n      particular skin affected by Primary Immunodeficiency. However, they are valuable indicators\n      that will help us modify the GAMMAGARD dosage and duration to inject into that \"unknown\"\n      subdermal space for Aim 2.\n\n      Aim 2 would require 12 months, using GAMMAGARD, instead of Gadolinium, to demonstrate the\n      advantages of ASIS device subdermally over subcutaneously, for the same Primary\n      Immunodeficiency subjects. Of course that Relative Prolongation Ability Score in Aim1 will\n      be valuable, but it isn't absolutely required to start Aim 2, because GAMMAGARD's\n      Pharmacokinetics will be studied anyway, by following Peak and Trough levels of\n      immunoglobulin G.\n\n      However, the Pharmacokinetics of subdermally injected GAMMAGARD will be just dependent on\n      GAMMAGARD's diffusion out of that subdermal bloodless space; therefore, if GAMMAGARD getting\n      into the bloodstream becomes so severely inhibited, then we can just change the osmolality\n      of GAMMAGARD in the end. The therapeutic advantages of GAMMAGARD with ASIS device\n      subdermally over subcutaneously will also be studied by comparing the reduction of Validated\n      Acute Serious Bacterial Infections, adverse reactions, and injection site pain."
