Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Tirapazamine may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining\n      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and tirapazamine may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy with\n      tirapazamine and radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage III\n      non-small cell lung cancer."

Beginning on day 1, patients\n      undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks. Beginning 4-5 weeks after\n      completion of radiotherapy, patients with stable or responding disease receive consolidation\n      chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on\n      days 1 and 22.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tirapazamine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
