    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ACZ885 on
      aneurysmal growth rate in subjects with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The purpose of the
      study is to provide data to enable decisions regarding the further development of ACZ885 for
      subjects with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The design of this study addresses the primary
      objective of evaluating the change in aneurysmal size in subjects with AAA as a result of
      treatment with ACZ885.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects age ≥45 years of age

          2. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with maximum diameter: for men ≥40mm and ≤50mm;
             for women ≥38mm and ≤48mm.

          3. On a stable medical regimen for at least 2 weeks prior to dosing, per investigator
             assessment.

          4. Have an evaluable ultrasound image at screening for the quantitative determination of
             the AAA size, per imaging core lab assessment.

          5. At screening, vital signs should be within the following ranges: (a) oral body
             temperature between 35.0-37.5°C; (b) systolic blood pressure, 90-170 mm Hg; (c)
             diastolic blood pressure, 50-100 mm Hg; (d) pulse rate, 40 - 100 bpm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 half-lives
             of enrollment.

          2. Known diabetes by medical history, an HbA1c of ≥6.5% at screening, or on an active
             diabetic medical regimen.

          3. History of malignancy of any organ system other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin, treated or untreated, within the past 5 years.

          4. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during
             dosing and 30-day follow up period of the study.

          5. Donation or loss of 400 ml or more of blood within eight (8) weeks prior to initial
             dosing, or longer if required by local regulation.

          6. Subjects on the following medications:  (a) Chronic systemic steroid treatment or
             other systemic immunosuppression; (b) Any biologic drugs targeting the immune system,
             along with a history of any previous use of such drugs.

          7. Presence of a non-healing wound or infection, including active urinary tract
             infections, or any recent process requiring significant tissue healing per
             investigator assessment.
