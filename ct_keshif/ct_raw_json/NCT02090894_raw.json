            "textblock": "The objective of this study is to examine the ability of dermal rejuvenation therapies to\n      protect geriatric skin from ultraviolet light (UVB)-induced carcinogenesis.  Skin cancers\n      (including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) are the most common types of\n      malignancy and are related to UVB exposure in sunlight.  UVB-irradiation of skin causes\n      specific DNA damage to keratinocytes that can lead to cancer-causing mutations if they are\n      allowed to persist in proliferating cells.  Moreover, the incidence of skin cancers is much\n      greater in elderly over younger individuals. The objective of the present study is to build\n      upon our previous data and test the effect of a non ablative Nd:YAG laser (LaserGenesis) of\n      a localized area of skin on dermal IGF-1 production and UVB-mediated keratinocyte effects.\n      Treatment of skin using a non ablative high-peak power microsecond pulsed 1064 nm Nd:YAG\n      laser (Cutera's LaserGenesisTM laser) leads to papillary dermal heating. The laser targets\n      the microvasculature and stimulates collagen production while protecting the epidermis.\n      Generally, Laser Genesis is used clinically to improve irregularities in the contour,\n      texture, and color of the skin.  Laser Genesis is also used to help treat photoaging by\n      increasing collagen formation, suggesting that it stimulates fibroblast activity and thus\n      possibly increases levels of protective IGF-1."
