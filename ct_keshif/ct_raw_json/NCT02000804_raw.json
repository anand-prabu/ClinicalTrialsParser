All Subjects will receive 160 mg of enteric\n      coated micronised free-base darapladib as a single dose and as repeated daily doses for 28\n      days.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)\n      and safety of single and repeat oral dose of darapladib in healthy Chinese Subjects.  The\n      primary endpoints for safety are: clinical safety data from spontaneous adverse event\n      reporting, 12-lead electrocardiogram recording, vital sign measurement, nursing/physician\n      observation and clinical laboratory tests.  The primary PK parameters of interest are area\n      under plasma concentration time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of\n      darapladib, while the secondary PK parameters of interest are: time of occurrence of Cmax\n      (Tmax) and apparent terminal phase half-life (t1/2) of darapladib as well as AUC, Cmax, Tmax\n      and t1/2 of the metabolite, SB-553253.  Finally, the PD endpoint of interest is plasma Lp\n      PLA2 activity, as expressed in terms of percent inhibition relative to baseline."
