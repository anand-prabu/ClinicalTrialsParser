Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining these treatments before surgery may kill more tumor cells in patients with\n      non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy with radiation\n      therapy before surgery in treating patients who have stage IIB non-small cell lung cancer or\n      stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer."

Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity. At approximately 4 weeks after completion of\n      chemoradiotherapy, patients with stable or regressive disease undergo surgical resection. If\n      disease is unresectable, patients receive an additional 2 weeks of radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
