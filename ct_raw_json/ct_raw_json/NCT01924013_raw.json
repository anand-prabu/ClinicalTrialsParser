Infants enrolled in the study will be followed for 2 years to document the\n      persistence of any observed effects measured at 1 year of age. This study aims to enroll\n      1300 pregnant women in the 2nd trimester at a maternity hospital in Dhaka. Participants will\n      be randomized to one of three doses of vitamin D3 (4200 IU/week, 16,800 IU/week, or 28,000\n      IU/week) or placebo throughout pregnancy. Women in the 28,000 IU/week group will be\n      additionally randomized to either placebo or a continuation of 28,000 IU/week for 6 months\n      postpartum. In addition to linear length, the trial will include analyses of inflammatory\n      and hormonal determinants of infant growth, epigenetic phenomena that affect vitamin D\n      metabolism, and diarrheal and respiratory morbidity in the infants."
