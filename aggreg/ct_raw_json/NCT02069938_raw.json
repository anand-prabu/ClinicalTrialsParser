Current issues with\n      noninvasive BCIs include exhausting motor imagery tasks and long training times required to\n      achieve competent control. The investigators will address these issues within this protocol,\n      examining new approaches to reduce the effort required by subjects to control a physical\n      object in the task.\n\n      The PI's hypothesis is: Control of a physical robotic device will increase the performance\n      of subjects in BCI tasks that are analogous to virtual tasks due to greater engagement with\n      a physical output."
