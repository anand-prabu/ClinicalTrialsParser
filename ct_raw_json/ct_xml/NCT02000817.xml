  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase I/IIa study is to identify a safe and tolerable dosage regimen of
      intravenously administered otelixizumab.  In addition, the C-peptide decline in new onset
      type 1 diabetes mellitus (NOT1DM) patients and possible immunological mechanisms will be
      investigated with a view to identifying trends and early immunological biomarkers which
      could predict response in halting/slowing Beta-cell destruction in this patient population.

      This exploratory study will explore the safety and tolerability between the well tolerated
      but non-efficacious cumulative dose of 3.1 mg and a cumulative dose of 48 mg at which
      efficacy based on C-peptide analysis was demonstrated, albeit with evidence of Epstein Barr
      Virus (EBV) reactivation and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).  Exploration of the
      tolerability dose response is considered a necessary first step to determining the
      therapeutic index of otelixizumab.

             use contraception for 2 weeks prior to dosing and for 60 days after the last dose of
             study drug or has only same-sex partners (refrains from heterosexual intercourse),
             when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one
             of the contraception methods listed in study protocol.  This criterion must be
             followed from 2 weeks prior to dosing and for 60 days after the last dose of study
             drug.

             subject eligibility and withdrawal, QTcF will be used.  For purposes of data
             analysis, QTcF will be used as primary.  The QTc should be based on single or
             averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief
             recording period.

             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new investigational drugs within 12 months prior to the
             first dosing day.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

             sinusitis, localized cellulitis, candidiasis, or urinary tract infections, must be
             assessed on a case-by-case basis by the investigator regarding whether they are
             serious enough to warrant exclusion).
