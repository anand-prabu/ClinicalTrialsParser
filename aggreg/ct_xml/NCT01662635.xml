  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because ALK-positive lung cancer constitutes less than 5% of all lung cancers, it is
      critically important to select those patients who are more likely to have the ALK mutation.
      Clinical characteristics of patients with mutations in the target gene should also be known,
      so that the incidence of a given target mutation is established in a specific population.
      There is not incidence known in Mexican population, but it is believed it is greater.

      Lung adenocarcinoma studies. The only inclusion criterion was the availability of tissue for
      biomarker studies. To identify ALK rearrangements, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      studies were performed on 3 to 4 mm thick paraffin sections from NSCLCs. The commercially
      labeled Vysis LSI ALK Dual Color (split-apart), break-apart rearrangement probe (Abbott
      Molecular, Abbott Park, IL) was used to detect any rearrangement involving the ALK gene. The
      probe hybridizes to band 2p23, on either side of the ALK gene breakpoint. Criteria for probe
      signal interpretation in at least 200 interphase nuclei were as follow: 1) separated green
      and orange signals or single red signals identified cells with rearranged ALK; 2)
      overlapping of red and green signals (yellowish) indicated cells in which ALK was not
      rearranged.

      FISH-positive samples for ALK rearrangement were defined as having cells with a clearly
      separated pair of probe signals, or with &gt;15% of cells having loss of the 5´(centromeric)
      probe. The higher threshold for loss is necessary because parts of probes can be lost during
      sectioning Clinical details of these patients were included in a database. Further results
      will be analyzed with the program SPSS17

      To identify ALK rearrangements, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were
      performed on 3 to 4 microm thick paraffin sections from NSCLCs. Reverse transcription of
      total RNA was performed using High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Appied Biosystems, CA) each
      reaction containing 10 microg RNA, 1x RT buffer, 4 mM dNTP mix, 1x random hexamer primers,
      50 U reverse transcriptase and 20 U RNAse inhibitor in a total volume of 100 microl.
