Approximately 60 HCV\n      Genotype 1 patients who fail to achieve RVR at wk 4 but achieve undetectable HCV RNA at wk 8\n      (<50 IU/ml) will be recruited into 2 arms(30 in each arm). Patients must receive pegylated\n      IFN-\u03b12b at 1.5 \u03bcg/kg of body weight/week and ribavirin 800~1400 mg/day for 12 wks before\n      entering this study.\n\n      Study Duration:\n\n      The estimated recruitment period is 12 months; the follow-up duration is 72 weeks (longest\n      treatment period plus 6 month- f/u period); the total study duration (FPE->LPLV) is\n      estimated to be 2.5 years\n\n      Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Justification:\n\n      A. The study is not primarily designed for hypothesis testing; thus the sample size\n      calculation is not based on the primary objective, Approximately 60 subjects (30 in each\n      arm) will be recruited into this study B. For descriptive statistics, the continuous\n      variables will be expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and the categorical variables will\n      be performed the number of cases and the corresponding percentages.\n\n      The primary analysis will focus on the efficacy response to the shortened HCV treatment\n      course (36 wks) compared with standard course (48 wks). The between-group difference for\n      efficacy endpoint will be assessed by the difference in the percentage of virologic\n      responder after 24 wks of HCV treatment. For univariate analyses, comparisons of independent\n      samples (shortened vs. standard course) will be assessed with Student's t test. The\n      comparisons of categorical variables will be assessed using the chi-square test. Regarding\n      the multivariate analysis, the proportion of patients achieving virologic responder will be\n      compared among groups using a logistic regression analysis with terms of potential\n      confounding factors. The OR estimates will be derived from the logistic regression model and\n      the corresponding 95% CIs will be used to quantify the each effect of treatment course\n      length and confounding factors.\n\n      All randomized patients who take at least one dose of HCV regimen will be included in safety\n      assessment. Fisher's exact test will be used to compare between-group incidences of AEs. For\n      patients with any clinical AEs, treatment related AEs, serious AEs, or discontinuations\n      because of AEs, the data among groups will be provided as well. Statistical significance\n      will be determined at the 0.05 level for all tests."
