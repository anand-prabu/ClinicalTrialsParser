This substudy is a clinical physiologic proposal designed to determine the effects of long-term (6 months) ASV on cardiac energetics and SN function in patients with chronic stable HF and sleep apnea extending our previous evaluation of short-term CPAP in patients with OSA and HF.\nAll subjects consenting to the ADVENT primary trial will be eligible to participate in the substudy.\nSubstudy consenting patients will have [11C]acetate and [11C]HED PET imaging; HR variability; plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels, urine normetanephrine levels within 2 weeks of the sleep study. Baseline measurements will be repeated after 6 months in all patients."

            "textblock": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA)  and heart failure (HF) are states\n      of metabolic demand and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. In patients with sleep\n      apnea and HF, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) initially may reduce left\n      ventricular (LV)stroke volume (SV) but subsequently improves  and LV function. This may\n      relate to an early beneficial effect on myocardial energetics through early reduction in\n      metabolic demand that subsequently leads to improved efficiency of LV contraction. However,\n      it is not clear whether long-term adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) favorably affects cardiac\n      energetics. Any such benefit may also relate to reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS)\n      activation.  However its effect on myocardial SNS function is also not well studied.\n\n      In a pilot study we demonstrated early (6 week) beneficial effects of CPAP in patients with\n      OSA and HF.   The current proposal (AMEND) is a unique substudy of the recently funded\n      ADVENT-HF trial (Adaptive Servo Ventilation for Therapy of Sleep Apnea in HeartFailure)\n      (NCT01128816; CIHR; D. Bradley, PI).\n\n      We propose to evaluate the long-term (6 month) effects of ASV on daytime 1) oxidative\n      metabolism; 2) the work metabolic index (WMI) as an estimate of mechanical efficiency; 3)\n      myocardial sympathetic nerve (SN) pre-synaptic function; and 4) heart rate (HR) variability\n      in patients with HF and coexisting OSA or CSA.  In conjunction with echocardiographic\n      measures of LV stroke work, positron emission tomography (PET) derived [11C] acetate\n      kinetics will be used as a measure of oxidative metabolism, to determine the WMI. [11C]\n      hydroxyephedrine (HED) retention will be used to measure cardiac SN pre-synaptic function.\n\n      Primary Hypotheses: In patients with chronic stable HF and CSA or OSA without excessive\n      daytime sleepiness (EDS), long-term (6-month) ASV therapy yields:\n\n        1. Beneficial effects on daytime myocardial metabolism leading to a reduction in the rate\n           of oxidative metabolism as measured by [11C]acetate kinetics using PET imaging;\n\n        2. Improvement in energy transduction from oxidative metabolism to stroke work as measured\n           by an increase in the daytime work-metabolic index."

OSA\n      often coexists with HF.\n\n      Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by: reductions in central respiratory drive\n      during sleep that leads to episodes of partial or complete cessation of airflow. CSA often\n      co-exists with HF.\n\n      Continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) delivers air through a nasal or oral interface to\n      preserve upper airway patency. It is a treatment for symptomatic OSA or some patients with\n      CSA.\n\n      Adaptive Servoventilation (ASV) is effective in alleviating OSA and CSA. It provides\n      expiratory positive pressure to alleviate OSA, and inspiratory positive airway pressure to\n      eliminate CSA.\n\n      Oxidative metabolism: utilization of substrates via the tricarboxylic acid cycle for\n      Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production; it is linked to myocardial oxygen consumption and\n      can be measured with [11C]acetate PET.\n\n      The work-metabolic index (WMI) is the external work (minute-work) of the left ventricle\n      corrected for the rate of oxidative metabolism and is an estimate of mechanical efficiency.\n\n      Myocardial sympathetic neuron (SN) presynaptic function is the measure of uptake and storage\n      of neuronal catecholamines in the heart measured by [11C]hydroxyephedrine (HED) PET."
