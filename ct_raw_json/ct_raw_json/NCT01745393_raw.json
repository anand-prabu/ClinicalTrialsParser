This project will\n      test the effectiveness of a comprehensive multilevel intervention to reduce young children's\n      SHSe in minority and medically underserved communities known to have the highest\n      SHSe-related morbidity and mortality risk. First, we will provide a clinic-level quality\n      improvement (CQI) intervention to improve the care of pediatric patients with SHSe in four\n      pediatric clinics in North and West Philadelphia. We will then randomize eligible parents\n      visiting the CQI clinics into either a home-level behavioral counseling intervention\n      (CQI+BC) or a home-level attention control intervention (CQI+A). In addition to clinic-level\n      intervention, CQI+BC provides personalized, behavioral counseling with intensive skills\n      training and support where SHSe occurs (in the home), as well as systems navigation to\n      facilitate access to and effective use of reimbursable nicotine replacement therapy and\n      smoking cessation medication. Participants will complete assessments at pre-treatment,\n      3-month end of treatment, and 12-month follow-up."
