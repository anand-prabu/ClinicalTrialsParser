Clinical analyses have discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with\n      tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few\n      studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF signaling in ICC cells and its possible\n      mechanism in regulating ICC growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal\n      in ICC growth,proliferation and apoptosis."
