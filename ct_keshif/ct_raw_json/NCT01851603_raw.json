            "textblock": "AVL-3288, a \"first in class\" small molecule, selective allosteric modulator of the \u03b17 nAChR,\n      is implicated in the cognitive deficit in patients with neurologic and psychiatric\n      disorders, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity\n      disorder. The mechanism of action, the allosteric modulation of \u03b17 nAChR and improvement of\n      cognitive and memory function both in relevant animal models and patients has been clearly\n      described in recent literature. The effect of AVL-3288 strongly supports the rationale for\n      use in schizophrenia given the dose effect relationship, peaking at a low dose in rats (HED\n      3 mg), in rodent schizophrenia and memory models.  Phase I, single-center, inpatient,\n      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalating study to evaluate the safety,\n      tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of single oral doses of AVL-3288 in healthy\n      subjects.  Subjects will be hospitalized in the University of Colorado Clinical Research\n      Center (CTSA) for a 12 hour period after the single dose. Then there will be an ambulatory\n      24 and 48 hour observation and washout period of 10.  Patients will receive an evoked\n      potential measurement, the P50 sensory gating paradigm, and the Repeatable Battery for\n      Assessment of Neuropsychological Status."
