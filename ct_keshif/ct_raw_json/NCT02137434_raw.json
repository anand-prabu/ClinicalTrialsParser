Fatty meals lead to oxidative and inflammation which seems to\n      interfere in postprandial dismetabolism, a predictor of cardiovascular events. To\n      investigate calcium acute influence over the postprandial effects of a fatty meal a\n      crossover, controlled, and randomized clinical trial will be conducted with obese adult\n      women who will be randomized into one of the three interventions, characterized by a fatty\n      meal with different contents of calcium: low calcium (40 mg), high dietary calcium (540 mg\n      from non-fat milk), and high supplementary calcium (540 mg from calcium carbonate). Each\n      participant will receive all three meals and one of them every week. Before meals' intake\n      blood sample will be collected and endothelial function assess will be performed.\n      Participants will eat the specific meal and endothelial function will be assessed again\n      after 120 minutes. Blood sample collections will be repeated every 60 minutes after meal's\n      intake to perform latter biochemical analyzes to determine: 8-isoprostane levels, to assess\n      oxidative stress status; triglycerides; glucose; insulin; and serum calcium. Blood pressure\n      will be continuously assessed during 25 minutes before meals' intake and during 2 hours\n      after it."
