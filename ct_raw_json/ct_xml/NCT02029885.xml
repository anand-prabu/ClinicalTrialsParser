      targeting and tracking is a safe and effective treatment of moderate and severe resistant
      hypertension.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center trial wherein each eligible subject will receive
      the investigational externally focused ultrasound renal denervation therapy. It will be
      conducted on a maximum of fifty subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and have signed
      the informed consent form.  Candidate subjects will be recruited by the investigator from
      his patient population. The research protocol does not require withholding or postponing any
      medically indicated health care.

      After completing screening testing, the Kona Medical Surround Sound Treatment will be
      administered.  Both the left and right side will be treated sequentially during the same
      treatment session. Safety and functional evaluation occurs three weeks, six weeks and three,
      six, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months after completion of the treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 years of age.

          2. Average SBP ≥ 140 mmHg, measured per Appendix A.

          3. 24 hour average ABPM daytime SBP ≥ 130 mmHg.

          4. No medication changes for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to screening.

          5. At minimum, subject must be on at least three antihypertensive medications, with one
             being a diuretic, and each must meet one or more of the following full dose criteria:

               1. Highest labeled dose according to medication's labeling;

               2. Highest usual dose per clinical guidelines JNC-7[13];

               3. Highest tolerated dose; and/or

               4. Highest appropriate dose for the subject per the PI's clinical judgment.

          6. Subject has two functioning kidneys.

          7. Subject has an eGFR value of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (MDRD formula).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has hydronephrosis as seen on ultrasound.

          2. Subject has evidence of clinically significant renal artery stenosis as determined by
             flow rate, velocity and Doppler analysis on ultrasound

          3. Subject has kidney stones that are of a size and location that are determined at
             discretion of the investigator to potentially interfere with treatment

          4. Subject has a history of abdominal surgery within the past six months

          5. Subject had a previous renal denervation within the past six months

          6. Subject has heterogeneities in the kidney such as large cysts or tumors that are
             determined at discretion of the investigator to potentially interfere with treatment.

          7. Subject has residual pyelonephritis as seen on MRI or ultrasound.

          8. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension in past year.
