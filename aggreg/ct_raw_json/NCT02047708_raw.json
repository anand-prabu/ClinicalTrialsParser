            "textblock": "Many patients with scleroderma have damage to their kidneys caused by the disease. There is\n      limited evidence for treatments to prevent this damage or stop it progressing. Blocking a\n      substance in the blood called endothelin has helped treat some aspects of scleroderma. The\n      purpose of this study is to see how effective a new endothelin blocker called Zibotentan is\n      in treating patients who have scleroderma and have gone on to develop reduced kidney\n      function as a complication. It will be given in addition to the accepted treatments used for\n      scleroderma. There will be three parts to this study each for a different group of patients:\n\n        -  ZEBRA 1 for patients with mild or moderate kidney disease caused by scleroderma\n\n        -  ZEBRA 2A for patients with a more severe, acute form of kidney disease caused by\n           scleroderma (scleroderma renal crisis) who do not require dialysis\n\n        -  ZEBRA 2B for patients who have had scleroderma renal crisis and are on dialysis"

Scleroderma (Systemic sclerosis) is a multisystem rheumatic disease that results\n      in vascular damage and fibrosis of target organs.This project will focus specifically on the\n      evaluation and treatment of renal disease in scleroderma.\n\n      Renal involvement in Scleroderma occurs with a variety of different pathologies\u037e\n      hypertensive scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) being the most dramatic manifestation but milder\n      forms of chronic renal disease are frequent and represent an important clinical feature."
