  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to show whether a standard oral steroid dose pack
      can be used as a  screeening tool to assess the effectiveness of a susequent epidural
      steroid injection (ESI). If an oral steroid does not give a patient significant temporary
      relief  of pain from a herniated lumbar disc  then an epidural steroid injection will not
      either. Therefore the risk and expense associated from the interventional pain management
      procedure for those patients could be avoided and other treatment modalities pursued.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years and older

          -  Diagnosed by participating physicians during the study enrollment period as having
             intervertebral disk herniation and persistent symptoms with or without some
             nonoperative treatment for at least 4 weeks

          -  Radicular pain (below the knee for lower lumbar herniations, into the anterior thigh
             for upper lumbar herniations)

          -  Evidence of nerve-root irritation with a positive nerve-root tension sign (straight
             leg raise-positive between 30° and 70°) or a corresponding neurologic deficit
             (asymmetrical depressed reflex, decreased sensation in a dermatomal distribution)

          -  Undergone either MRI or CT scan  showing disc herniation (protrusion, extrusion, or
             sequestered fragment) at a level and side corresponding to the clinical symptoms

          -  Patients with multiple herniations can be included if only one of the herniations is
             considered symptomatic

          -  Preenrollment nonprocedural care can include: education/counseling, physical therapy,
             chiropractic therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, opioid analgesics, adjuvant
             analgesics such as anticonvulsants and antidepressants

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior lumbar surgery

          -  Cauda equina syndrome

          -  Vertebral fractures

          -  Spine infection or tumor

          -  Severe motor deficit

          -  Inflammatory spondyloarthropathy

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Cardiac or pulmonary comorbid conditions contraindicating interventional   procedures

          -  Diabetes

          -  Inability/unwillingness to have spinal injections
