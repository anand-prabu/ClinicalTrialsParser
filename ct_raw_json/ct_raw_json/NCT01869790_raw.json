Total fat content in lunches B-D will be the same.  Subjects will\n      receive identical insulin doses (calculated using the subject's usual\n      insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio) for the meals.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that, despite identical carbohydrate content,the lunches\n      higher in saturated fat will lead to more postprandial hyperglycemia than the lunch\n      containing minimal fat and the lunch high in monounsaturated fat.\n\n      The hypothesis is that from time points 0-180 minute area under the curve for Lunches A, B,\n      C, and D will be the same, whereas from time points 180-360 minutes for Lunch B and D will\n      be greater than that of Lunch A and C."

Subjects will have several admissions and, in random order, will receive\n      lunches with identical carbohydrate content but different fat content: lunch A will minimal\n      fat content, lunch B will contain added butter, lunch C will contain added olive oil, and\n      lunch D will contain added cheese.
