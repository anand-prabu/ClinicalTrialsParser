Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive a low fat, high fiber diet daily for 3 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive a control diet containing the standard amounts of fat and\n           fiber.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      6 months."
