      The Cryotop method for oocyte vitrification is classified as &quot;open system&quot;, which means that
      it requires direct contact with liquid nitrogen during the vitrification process. The system
      has an external straw to protect the samples during storage, but the device is not
      hermetically sealed. Instead closed systems are devices that are hermetically sealed before
      vitrification and remain sealed during storage. Open systems have proven highly effective in
      achieving similar outcomes with vitrified oocytes compared to those achieved with fresh
      ones. On the contrary, closed systems have failed to be as effective as open ones when used
      for oocyte vitrification. Although open systems have proven to be highly efficient, where
      many other methods have failed, they have been related to a theoretical risk of
      contamination due to direct contact with liquid nitrogen. Though to date there have been no
      reported cases of transmission of disease after cryo-transfers either for slow freezing or
      vitrification, some European countries prohibit the use of open systems for vitrification.
      In this study, we will evaluate the results after the donor oocyte vitrification, using a
      modification of a current device (Cryotop®), which makes it capable of being hermetically
      sealed. The current study is a prospective randomized trial aimed to assess the outcome of
      ovum donation cycles conducted with vitrified oocytes using the closed device versus oocytes
      vitrified using the traditional open device.
