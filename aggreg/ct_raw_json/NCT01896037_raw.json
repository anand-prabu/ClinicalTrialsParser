            "textblock": "People with a spinal cord injury (SCI) characteristically have low levels of high-density\n      lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c; \"good cholesterol\") and high levels of low-density\n      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c; \"bad cholesterol\"), and are at a higher risk of developing\n      cardiovascular health problems, such as heart disease, heart attack and stroke, than the\n      able-bodied population.  A common way for able-bodied people to improve their lipid profile\n      is through exercise; however, SCI people, especially tetraplegics, are often unable to\n      achieve and maintain a level of exercise needed to obtain these benefits.  It is therefore\n      clinically important to find an effective, safe and inexpensive method of increasing HDL-c\n      levels in people with chronic tetraplegia.  This study will investigate the effects of\n      omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the lipid profile of people with tetraplegia.  The\n      investigators hypothesize that 5 months of daily consumption of high doses of omega-3 fatty\n      acids will increase plasma levels of HDL-c in those with tetraplegia, leading to decreased\n      risk of cardiovascular health issues."
