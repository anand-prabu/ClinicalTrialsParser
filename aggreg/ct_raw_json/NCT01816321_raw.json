These findings\n      provide a strong rationale for a definitive large RCT. The COMPORT study will provide\n      conclusive evidence regarding the superiority or not of this novel protocol with\n      corifollitropin alfa followed by hpHMG for the treatment of young poor ovarian responders\n      fulfilling the Bologna criteria."

However, a limited number of\n      studies has been published to date including patients with poor ovarian response according\n      to the \"Bologna criteria\", whereas no randomized trial is published or ongoing for this\n      population.\n\n      Preliminary reports in \"Bologna poor responders\" highlight the limited prospects for these\n      women. Natural cycle IVF has been shown to result in disappointingly low live birth rates,\n      regardless of patients' age and ovarian stimulation with widely accepted treatment\n      modalities, e.g. short agonist protocol, did not appear demonstrate substantial benefits.\n\n      Nonetheless, despite the disappointing results from the vast majority of the preliminary\n      studies in this population, a recent pilot study by our group has shown that a specific\n      protocol may indeed be a promising option for women of younger age fulfilling the \"Bologna\n      criteria\". Corifollitropin alfa followed by highly purified hMG in an antagonist protocol\n      demonstrated an ongoing pregnancy rate of 28% in women <40years, strongly suggesting the\n      conduction of a future randomized trial testing this novel treatment protocol"
