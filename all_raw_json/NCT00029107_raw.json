            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Rituximab (anti-CD20) in the\n      treatment of patients with hepatitis C associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (HCV-CV) who\n      have failed or are intolerant to interferon-alpha/ribavirin therapy.  Up to 75 patients may\n      be screened to enroll 34 adult patients with active HCV-CV in this randomized, non-blinded\n      phase I/II trial.  Patients will be randomized to receive either Rituximab 375 mg/M(2) on\n      days 1, 8, 15 and 22 beginning at the time of enrollment or standard therapy.   Patients in\n      both groups will be maintained on stable doses of any immunosuppressive therapies that they\n      were receiving at the time of enrollment.  Response to Rituximab will be assessed by\n      clinical and laboratory parameters.\n\n      Although the cause of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is not known, a critical component is the\n      presence of cryoglobulins-abnormal proteins that white blood cells called B lymphocytes\n      produce in response to the chronic hepatitis C infection. Rituximab decreases the number of\n      B cells. The Food and Drug Administration approved Rituximab in 1997 for the treatment of\n      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with hepatitis C and signs and symptoms of\n      cryoglobulinemic vasculitis may be eligible for this study. They must have failed, or been\n      unable to tolerate, treatment with IFN-a and ribavirin. Candidates will be screened with a\n      history and physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood and urine tests, 24-hour\n      urine collection and chest X-ray, if clinically indicated.\n\n      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive Rituximab upon entering the study or 6\n      months after entering the study. Those whose treatment is delayed 6 months will be followed\n      once a month at NIH for disease evaluation and blood tests during that time.\n\n      Patients will be given Rituximab intravenously (through a vein) once a week for 4 weeks. For\n      the first dose, patients will be admitted to the hospital for at least 24 hours after the\n      infusion for monitoring. Subsequent infusions will be given on an inpatient or outpatient\n      basis, depending on how the infusion is tolerated. The day before each infusion they will\n      have a history and physical examination, blood work, and other tests, such as X-rays, as\n      clinically indicated.\n\n      After the four infusions, patients will be followed for drug side effects and response to\n      treatment. They will have blood tests every week for 4 weeks and will then return to NIH for\n      1 day every month for 12 months for a physical examination, blood tests, and X-rays, if\n      medically indicated. Visits may be more frequent, if necessary, and patients may be asked to\n      stay longer than a day if test findings requ..."

Rituximab decreases the number of\n      B cells. The Food and Drug Administration approved Rituximab in 1997 for the treatment of\n      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with hepatitis C and signs and symptoms of\n      cryoglobulinemic vasculitis may be eligible for this study. They must have failed, or been\n      unable to tolerate, treatment with IFN-a and ribavirin. Candidates will be screened with a\n      history and physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood and urine tests, 24-hour\n      urine collection and chest X-ray, if clinically indicated.\n\n      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive Rituximab or standard therapy for 6 months\n      after entering the study. All patients will be followed once a month at NIH for disease\n      evaluation and blood tests during that time.\n\n      Patients will be given Rituximab 375 mg/m2intravenously once a week for 4 weeks.  The day\n      before each infusion they will have a history and physical examination, blood work, and\n      other tests, such as X-rays, as clinically indicated.\n\n      After the four infusions, patients will be followed for drug side effects and response to\n      treatment. They will have blood tests every week for 4 weeks and will then return to NIH for\n      1 day every month for 12 months for a physical examination, blood tests, and X-rays, if\n      medically indicated.
