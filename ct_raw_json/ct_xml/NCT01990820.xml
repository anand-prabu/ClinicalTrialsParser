  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis, a common diagnosis in children, remains a poorly understood disease.
       Adenoidectomy (surgery to take out the adenoid pads- infection fighting glands in the back
      of the throat) is performed since the adenoid pad may trap germs that enter a child's body
      and can get so swollen with bacteria that they become infected themselves. Functional
      endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and adenoidectomy are currently the most common surgeries
      performed on children with this disease.  Another treatment is  adenoidectomy and irrigation
      of the maxillary sinus without FESS.  New technology has emerged using a balloon catheter to
      dilate (open) the sinus passage in addition to the adenoidectomy and irrigation.  This study
      seeks to answer if children with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo adenoidectomy with
      balloon dilation of the maxillary sinus passage and irrigation experience improved quality
      of life outcomes compared to children with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo an
      adenoidectomy with maxillary sinus irrigation without dilation of the sinus passage.

    <description>A rigid nasal endoscopy will be performed. After decongesting with oxymetazoline hydrochloride, the balloon catheter device will be inserted and the wire/balloon will be threaded through the maxillary sinus ostia. Confirmation of location will be per manufacturer's recommendation with either fluoroscopy or illumination. Following confirmation, the balloon will be dilated under visualization per manufacture's recommendation. After the visualization of the dilated ostia, cultures for aerobic/anerobic examination will be taken and irrigation with 10ml of isotonic sodium chloride will be performed.
Adenoidectomy will be performed using either the microdebrider or suction electrocautery in the usual manner.</description>

    <description>A rigid nasal endoscopy will be performed. After decongesting with oxymetazoline hydrochloride, the maxillary sinuses will be entered via middle meati punctures using either a sterile spinal needle or a curved suction. Sinus contents will be aspirated and sent for aerobic/anaerobic cultures. Irrigation with 10ml of isotonic sodium chloride will be performed. If no material is aspirated initially, the sinus contents will be re-aspirated after irrigation and sent for aerobic/anaerobic cultures.
Adenoidectomy will be performed using either the microdebrider or suction electrocautery in the usual manner.
After adequate hemostasis, the patient will be awakened and brought to the recovery room. Depending on the recovery, the child will either be admitted or discharged home.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Sinonasal symptoms of at least 12 weeks' duration or recurrent sinusitis &gt;3x/year

          2. Failure to respond to 3-week course of antibiotic and 3 month course of nasal steroid
             preparations or antihistamines as well as saline nasal irrigation

          3. Rhinosinusitis documented by CT scan following oral antibiotic course.

        Computer tomographic findings considered to be consistent with sinusitis include partial
        or complete sinus opacification.

        Allergy and immunology workup will be recommended on an individual basis -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with extensive sinonasal polyps, extensive sinonasal osteoneogenesis,
             sinonasal tumors

          2. History of facial trauma that distorts sinus anatomy

          3. Ciliary dysfunction

          4. Pregnancy will be excluded.

          5. Patients with cystic fibrosis, craniofacial anomalies, metabolic disorders, or
             immunodeficiencies

          6. Patients who have had their adenoids removed and thus may be candidates for
             functional endoscopic sinus surgery will also be excluded.

          7. Patients with a history of sinus surgery or significant anatomic abnormalities on CT
             scan that would require endoscopic sinus surgery or septoplasty would also be
             excluded.

        Of note, children who will be undergoing concurrent surgeries will not be excluded.
