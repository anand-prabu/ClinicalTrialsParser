Udenafil is being tested to treat\n      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and\n      for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). This study will look at the change in lower\n      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in\n      erectile dysfunction (ED) in people who take Udenafil.\n\n      The study will enroll approximately 950 patients. Participants taking BPH or ED medication\n      will enter a 4-week wash out period. Patients not previously treated and those who\n      accomplished the wash out period will enter a placebo (dummy inactive pill) lead-in period\n      of another 4 weeks. Participants will then be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a\n      coin) to one of the four treatment groups\u2014which will remain undisclosed to the patient and\n      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):\n\n        -  Udenafil 25 mg\n\n        -  Udenafil 50 mg\n\n        -  Udenafil 75 mg\n\n        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has\n           no active ingredient\n\n      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the\n      study, and will be asked to keep a Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary.\n\n      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Mexico. The overall time to participate in this\n      study is up to 20 weeks. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic."
