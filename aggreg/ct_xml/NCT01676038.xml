  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of total knee arthroplasty depends on a number of factors including
      pre-operative range of movement, obesity, medical comorbidities, prosthesis design,
      preparation and implantation of the prosthesis, soft tissue balancing, as well as implants
      alignment. Optimal placement of the implants within 3° of the mechanical axis of the lower
      limb has been proven to reduce wear and early implant failure.

      Compared to conventional techniques, computer-Aided Navigation total knee arthroplasty has
      been widely used in the last decade and have been proven to improve the accuracy of
      prosthesis placement and lower limb alignment by reducing the number of outliers with more
      than 3° deviation from the mechanical axis. However, its use also involves a steep learning
      curve, high initial capital cost and longer duration of surgery.

      Traditional computer-navigated TKA using optical tracking systems also requires fixation of
      the femoral and tibial reference arrays to bone using anchoring pins. Complications reported
      with the use of these pins include either femoral or tibial fracture, pin site pain, pin
      site infection and osteomyelitis. The investigators study aims to investigate the accuracy
      of a new pinless navigation system for TKA that will avoid these complications.

      The duration of surgery and length of hospital stay were recorded for all patients. Three
      radiographic measurements were recorded on the coronal films: 1) Hip-Knee-Ankle Angle (HKA),
      the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the femur (line between the centre of the femoral
      head and the centre of the knee) and the mechanical axis of the tibia (line between the
      centre of the talus and the centre of the knee); 2) Coronal Femoral-Component Angle (CFA),
      the angle formed by the femoral component and the mechanical axis of the femur; 3) Coronal
      Tibia-Component Angle (CTA), the angle formed by the tibia base plate and the mechanical
      axis of the tibia. The post-operative radiographic measurements were compared with the
      intra-operative readings from the pinless navigation system. The accepted values used in our
      study for normal alignment were: 1) 0° ± 3° varus/valgus for HKA; 2) perpendicular (± 3°) to
      the mechanical axis of the femur; 3) perpendicular (± 3°) to the mechanical axis of the
      tibia.
