  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will invite a convenience sample of up to 45 enrolled subjects to participate in an
      optional, self-administered blood specimen collection procedure. Participants will be
      recruited to this one-time assessment during their follow-up visits. After completing a
      consent procedure specific to this study component, participants will be provided with
      instructions on how to fully self-administer the procedure of a finger stick and also
      blotting to collect a blood specimen using a 1, 3 or 5 blood spot specimen collection card.
      These specimens will be labeled with the participant's unique identification number, and no
      other identifying information. The dried blood spots will be evaluated by a laboratorian to
      assess quality, but will not be tested for HIV. This evaluation will help determine what
      number of self-collected dried blood spots yields the highest usable quantity of sample for
      HIV testing. There will be a separate monetary incentive of $30 for this procedure.

        Participants will be enrolled or previously enrolled in the InvolveMENt Study through
        Emory University. They will be assesed for study interest either at the end of their
        scheduled appointment with InvolveMENt, or will be contacted if consent to contact them
        for future studies was previously obtained through InvolveMENt.
