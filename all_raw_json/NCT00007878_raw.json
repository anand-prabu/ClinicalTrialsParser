Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor\n      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib\n      together with chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for solid tumors."

To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PS-341\n      (bortezomib) when administered as a bolus injection two times a week (on days 1 and 4) for 2\n      weeks followed by one week of rest.\n\n      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of PS-341 by determining the 20S proteasome and nuclear\n      factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) inhibition in blood of\n      patients treated with intravenous PS-341 combined with weekly fluorouracil (5-FU) and\n      leucovorin calcium (LV).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To identify any objective tumor response in patients treated with intravenous PS-341.\n\n      II. To evaluate the relationship between inhibition of the 20S proteasome and NFkB and\n      clinical toxicity.\n\n      III. To obtain preliminary data on molecular correlates of response to PS-341 and 5-FU and\n      LV including genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation and\n      adhesion/angiogenesis based on the mechanisms of PS-341 IV. To examine the pharmacokinetics\n      of 5-FU when co-administered with PS-341.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.\n\n      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 4 and fluorouracil IV and\n      leucovorin calcium IV on day 1 weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."
