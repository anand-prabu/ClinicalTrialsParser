            "textblock": "Non small cell lung cancer represents the second most common type of cancer in both men and\n      women in the Western world. The availability of new active regimens in the first line\n      setting has prompted several investigators to consider second line therapy for patients with\n      advanced NSCLC, since a substantial percentage of patients maintain a good PS upon\n      recurrence. On the basis of the results of phase III trials docetaxel, erlotinib, gefitinib,\n      or pemetrexed are considered as \"standard\" choices for second-line therapy.\n\n      However, despite the increased availability of different drugs, NSCLC remains a devastating\n      disease with median OS which rarely exceeds 12 months.\n\n      Preclinical data of cabazitaxel have demonstrated antitumor activity in models resistant to\n      paclitaxel and docetaxel. In cell lines resistant to cytotoxic agents, cabazitaxel induced\n      further tumor regression.\n\n      The recommended phase 2 doses for Cabazitaxle were 20 and 25 mg/m2. Cabazitaxel showed\n      antitumor activity in solid tumors including docetaxel-refractory metastatic\n      castration-resistant prostate cancer and breast cancer."
