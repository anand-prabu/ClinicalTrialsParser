The study population will include\n      patients treated with lung SBRT at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre (OCC) over a specified 1\n      year time period who have consented to participating in the study.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Patients who consent to the study will be randomized into either the control group or\n      intervention group.  Simple randomization will be completed using a computer-generated\n      random number table.  Baseline ESAS scores will be collected on the last day of radiation\n      treatment for both groups.  Patients in the control group will have the standard follow up\n      plan as outlined earlier (CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis prior to follow-up with the\n      radiation oncologist 4 months after the completion of their treatment) and will be asked to\n      complete a questionnaire to assess their opinions regarding follow up during their clinic\n      appointment.  Patients in the intervention group will be telephoned by the CSRT 4-6 weeks\n      after completion of their treatment to assess any symptoms.  A second follow up telephone\n      call will be made at 12 weeks post treatment if required in order to address treatment\n      related side effects that were identified during the first call and any interventions that\n      were recommended.  When the patient returns to clinic for their first regularly scheduled\n      follow-up appointment, ESAS will be completed as well as a questionnaire to assess their\n      opinions regarding their follow up.\n\n      Inclusion criteria:\n\n      \u2022 Any patient treated with lung SBRT over a specified one year time frame.\n\n      Exclusion criteria:\n\n        1. Patients who are not 18 years of age or greater\n\n        2. Patients whose first language is not English and require translation.\n\n        3.
