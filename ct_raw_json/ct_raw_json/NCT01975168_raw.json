Group 1 receives laser acupuncture therapy first while Group 2\n      receives sham laser acupuncture therapy first. After 12 weeks of treatment and 14 days of\n      washout, Group 1 switch to sham laser acupuncture therapy while Group 2 switch to laser\n      acupuncture for 12 weeks. The subjects are treated with a gallium aluminum arsenide\n      Handylaser Trion, which is used to apply at each of the acupuncture points for 10 seconds\n      every time, 3 times per week. The measurements of outcomes are performed in the beginning,\n      weekly during treatment, and monthly after treatment for 3 months."
