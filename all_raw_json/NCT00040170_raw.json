The TG4010 is given as an injection under the skin\n      (subcutaneous) once a week for six weeks followed by a schedule of every three weeks or\n      every three weeks for the first twelve (12) weeks. If the therapy is working, it can be\n      continued for up to 9 months until no further improvement or until the patient gets worse\n      for as long as it is tolerated."
