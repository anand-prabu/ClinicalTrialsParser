Although several clinical tests for the diagnosis and monitoring of DES are\n      available, currently no gold standard for the assessment of DES exists. It has, however,\n      been hypothesized that the assessment of tear film osmolarity may be a new and promising\n      approach of an objective and non-invasive method for diagnosis and monitoring of treatment\n      success.\n\n      Recently, a new commercially available instrument (TearLab\u00ae, OcuSens Inc, San Diego, USA)\n      for the assessment of tear film osmolarity has been introduced. This instrument allows for\n      the easy and non-invasive determination of tear film osmolarity. Unfortunately, no data\n      about reproducibility are yet available. Consequently, the current study sets out to\n      investigate the short time reproducibility of tear film osmolarity measurements using the\n      TearLab\u00ae instrument."
