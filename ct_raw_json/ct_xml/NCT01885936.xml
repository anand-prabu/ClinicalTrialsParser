      In this study the study team proposes to investigate the efficacy of albuterol on motor
      function of individuals with Late Onset Pompe Disease (LOPD) who are receiving enzyme
      replacement therapy, given albuterol was well-tolerated in patients with Late Onset Pompe
      Disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Pompe disease by blood acid alpha-glucosidase assay and acid
             alpha-glucosidase gene sequencing,

          2. Age: 18+ years at enrollment.

          3. Receiving enzyme replacement therapy at standard dose (20 mg/kg every 2 weeks) for at
             least 52 weeks.

          4. Subjects are capable of giving written consent.

          5. 6 minute walk test latency &lt;85% of expected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Continuous invasive ventilation (via tracheostomy or endotracheal tube).

          2. Clinically relevant illness within two weeks of enrollment including fever &gt; 38.2 C,
