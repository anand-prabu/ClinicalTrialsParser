Spasticity and co-contraction of the rectus femoris muscle following stroke is\n      responsible for a lack of knee flexion in the swing phase of gait named stiff knee gait.\n\n      The rectus femoris spasticity is usually treated by oral medications, physical therapy and\n      botulinum toxin A injections (1,2). As botulinum toxin A has a transient effect, injections\n      must be repeated supporting to promote a permanent surgical treatment such as the rectus\n      femoris tenotomy (3). However, no study has evaluate neither compare the effect of the\n      rectus femoris tenotomy on gait and on the 3 domains of the International Classification of\n      Functioning Disability and Health .\n\n      OBJECTIVE\n\n      To compare the effect of the rectus femoris tenotomy and of the botulinum toxin A injections\n      for stiff knee gait after stroke according to the 3 domains of the International\n      Classification of Functioning Disability and Health\n\n      METHODS\n\n      The investigators will recruited 20 chronic stroke patients presenting with stiff knee gait.\n      The patients will be randomly assigned to a surgical group treated by rectus femoris\n      tenotomy (10 patients) and to a medical group treated by rectus femoris botulinum toxin A\n      injections.\n\n      Patients will be assessed before treatment, 2 months and 6 months after treatment by an\n      assessor blinded therapist among the 3 domains of the  International Classification of\n      Functioning Disability and Health\n\n      PERSPECTIVE\n\n      The investigator hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of the rectus femoris tenotomy as a\n      treatment of stiff knee gait after stroke"
