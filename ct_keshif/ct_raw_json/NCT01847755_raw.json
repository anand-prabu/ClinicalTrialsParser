MRI, CT or SPECT scans showing changes consistent with Traumatic Brain Injury\n      (TBI)and or medical history of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)as evidenced by medical records\n      will be screened for treatment with Hyperbaric.

Cognitive assessment will include the Trail Making Test Parts A and B.\n      Patient will be seen by physician to assess level of disability at each interval; the United\n      States Department of Veteran Affairs' Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Subjective\n      Symptoms (VAECI) (2012) tool will be utilized during the physician's evaluation as an\n      objective measure of the patient's level of disability.\n\n      Hyperbaric treatments may be adjusted for patient comfort. If the SPECT scan, cognitive\n      assessment and physician evaluation show improvement after 40 treatments, another 40\n      Hyperbaric(HBO)treatments will be administered. Treatments will be discontinued after a 40\n      session interval if the SPECT scan, cognitive assessment and physician evaluation show no\n      improvement. The patient will also have a SPECT scan and cognitive assessment follow up 3\n      months after final Hyperbaric(HBO) treatment.The time points for evaluation of cognitive\n      status and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan will be at at\n      40,80,120 Hyperbaric(HBO)treatments. Treatment will occur 5 times per week for approximately\n      24 weeks with another follow up 3 months post treatment. This will provide all data points\n      for outcome measure."
