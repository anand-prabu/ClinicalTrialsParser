Furosemide is also used in the treatment of hypertension.\n\n      Absorption of furosemide from the gastrointestinal tract is fairly rapid. Bioavailability is\n      reported as 60-70%, but is variable and not predictable. The rate and extent of absorption\n      show a large intra- and inter-individual variability and are influenced by dosage form,\n      underlying diseases, and by the presence of food after oral administration. Results obtained\n      with an animal model indicate that furosemide administered into the stomach is more rapidly\n      absorbed than if is is administered into the small intestine.\n\n      To increase the residency of furosemide in the stomach after oral administration, a\n      gastroretentive dosage form (GRDF) of furosemide has been developed. In this study, the new\n      formulation(30mg furosemide coated tablet) will be tested  in healthy male subjects.\n      Absorption will be characterised by imaging technique - Magnetic Marker Monitoring (MMM),\n      which is the most effective and safe imaging technique currently available. MMM is based on\n      a iron-III-oxide (Fe3O4) added to the drug product to generate magnetic signal that can be\n      used to localize the administered medication in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n      Fe3O4 is frequently used as colouring pigment in medicinal products. It does not exhibit own\n      pharmacodynamic activity and thus, it is considered as clinically inactive ingredient. Fe3O4\n      exhibits a dipole moment and thus, after magnetisation of solid oral dosage forms containing\n      homogenously distributed Fe3O4, the product generates a magnetic signal, which can be used\n      for localisation of the dosage form in the gastrointestinal tract by Magnetic Marker\n      Monitoring technique.\n\n      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the GRDF formulation of furosemide for: gastric\n      residence, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics   under fasting and fed\n      conditions. As part of the study, the subjects will be hospitalized for 1 day during each\n      drug administration (i.e. a total of two days).  The duration of the stay will depend on the\n      intestinal behaviour of the investigational product. The MMM monitoring be performed for up\n      to 12 h after furosemide administration. For pharmacokinetic determinations, liquid\n      chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) will be used to analyze\n      furosemide in plasma."
