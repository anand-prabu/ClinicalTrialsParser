  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if CC100, given by mouth, is safe and is tolerated in
      increasing doses.  How long the drug remains in the body will also be calculated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 18 healthy subjects will be randomized to receive by mouth either 3 single
      increasing doses of CC100 or 1 dose of placebo and 2 increasing doses of CC100.  Dosing will
      occur every 2 to 7 days for a study duration of 5 to 15 days from the 1st dose.  Subjects
      are required to stay in the Clinic for approximately 24 hours following each dose.  Subjects
      may choose to have an optional lumbar puncture following the 3rd dose of study drug.
