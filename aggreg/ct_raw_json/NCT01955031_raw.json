The French High Health Authority recommends a therapeutic\n      education on lifestyle and dietary rules in first-line treatment of Type 2 Diabetes\n      Mellitus. Despite these recommendations, patients often have difficulties to implement\n      dietary recommendations every day. The objective of EDUC@DOM is to help people with diabetes\n      to improve lifestyle and equilibrium of glycaemia in order to avoid or delay chronic\n      complications of diabetes. Our main goal is to assess effectiveness of our telemonitoring\n      program in type 2 patients' care compared to a usual care of diabetes, on the glycaemia of\n      the patients. It is expected that our program leads to a better monitoring of health status,\n      a greater adherence to medical and non-medical prescriptions, an empowerment of the patient,\n      and as a consequence, a more efficient health care consumption."
