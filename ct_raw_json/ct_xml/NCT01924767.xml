  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BI 10773 with
      repeat dosing for eight days and the exploration of the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of BI 10773 after multiple dosing, including dose proportionality and
      assessment of steady state.
