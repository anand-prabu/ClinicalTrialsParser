The SBHC allows inner-city children who face barriers to accessing health care the\n      opportunity to receive health care in their school. The primary aim of this study is to\n      determine utilization of the SBHC. The secondary aims are a) to assess whether attending the\n      SBHC resulted in important changes in health outcomes, and b) to compare rates of\n      absenteeism from the first year of the SBHC to the year prior to implementation.\n      Establishing feasibility of the SBHC would support further development and expansion of this\n      program into other inner city schools."
