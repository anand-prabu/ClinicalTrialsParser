            "textblock": "Diabetes type two is a debilitating disease that leads to chronic morbidity such as\n      accelerated microvascular disease. Accelerated microvascular disease may produce blindness,\n      end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and limb ischemia. Strategies to\n      prevent or delay microvascular disease have the potential to improve the lives of millions\n      and prevent catastrophic illness. The major focus of prevention of microvascular disease in\n      diabetes has been on the endothelium and its role in protection of blood vessels. An\n      unexpected means to prevent microvascular disease in diabetes may be coupled to the function\n      of vitamin C in red blood cells (RBCs) of diabetic subjects. Based on new and emerging data,\n      vitamin C concentrations in RBCs may be inversely related to glucose concentrations found in\n      diabetes. Based on animal data, we hypothesize that RBCs with low vitamin C levels may have\n      decreased deformability, leading to slower flow in capillaries and microvascular hypoxia,\n      the hallmark of diabetic microangiopathy. Low vitamin C concentrations in RBCs of diabetic\n      subjects may be able to be increased, by using vitamin C supplements. Findings in animals\n      may not accurately reflect effects in humans because of species differences in mechanisms of\n      vitamin C entry into RBCs. Therefore, clinical research is essential to characterize vitamin\n      C physiology in RBCs of diabetic subjects. In this protocol we will investigate physiology\n      of vitamin C in RBCs of diabetic subjects as a function of glycemia, with and without\n      vitamin C supplementation. We will screen type II diabetic subjects on insulin and select\n      those with low vitamin C levels and hemoglobin A1C concentrations of 8-12%. Selected\n      subjects will be hospitalized twice, each time for approximately one week. As inpatients,\n      subjects will have two venous sampling periods each of approximately 24 hours. For the first\n      sampling period, controlled hyperglycemia will be induced by withdrawing insulin and\n      providing a high carbohydrate load diet (70-75% carbohydrate). Hyperglycemia will not exceed\n      9 hours, and will be reversed by reinstituting insulin. The second sampling period, also for\n      24 hours, will be performed under conditions of euglycemic control.\n\n      During the two sampling periods, samples will be withdrawn via venous catheter for RBC\n      deformability and vitamin C concentrations.  At discharge, subjects will be placed on a\n      vitamin C supplement and seen as outpatients at weekly intervals. After 3 or 6 weeks\n      (depending on RBC vitamin C levels), subjects will be hospitalized again, and sampling\n      repeated as described. In this manner, each subject serves as his/her own control, and\n      deformability of red blood cells can be determined in relation to glycemia and to vitamin C\n      concentrations in RBCs and plasma."
