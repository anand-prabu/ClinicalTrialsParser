The initial diagnosis of asthma must have been made\n             before the patient's age of 40.\n\n          4. All patients must have a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 = 60% predicted and = 90% of\n             predicted normal at Visit 1.Variation of absolute pre-bronchodilator FEV1 values at\n             Visit 1 and Visit 2 must be within \u00b1 30%.\n\n          5. Patient's diagnosis of asthma has to be confirmed at Visit 1 with bronchodilator\n             reversibility (ie 10 minutes prior to and 15-30 minutes after inhalation of 400 \u00b5g\n             salbutamol) defined as an FEV1 increase of = 12% and = 200 mL.\n\n          6. All patients must have a diagnosis of moderate persistent asthma and must be\n             symptomatic despite their current maintenance treatment with medium doses of ICS.\n\n          7.

Patients must be able to use the Respimat inhaler correctly.\n\n         11. Patients must be able to perform all trial related procedures including technically\n             acceptable pulmonary function tests and use of the AM3 (e-diary) compliance of at\n             least 80% is required.\n\n         12. Patients taking a chronic pulmonary medication allowed by the study protocol must be\n             willing to continue this therapy for the entire duration of the study (exception:\n             times of acute disease deterioration).\n\n        Exclusion criteria:\n\n          1. Patients with a significant disease other than asthma. A significant disease is\n             defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may (i) put the\n             patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or (ii) influence the results\n             of the trial, or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate\n             in the trial.\n\n          2. Patients with a clinically relevant abnormal screening hematology or blood chemistry\n             at Visit 1 if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined in exclusion\n             criterion no. 1.\n\n          3. Patients requiring more than 12 puffs of rescue medication (salbutamol MDI) per 24\n             hours for more than 2 consecutive days between Visit 1 and Visit 2 (screening\n             period).\n\n          4. Patients with a recent history (ie six months or less) of Acute Coronary Syndrome\n             (STEMI, non-STEMI, Unstable Angina Pectoris) prior to Visit 1 (screening).\n\n          5. Patients who have been hospitalised for cardiac failure during the past year prior to\n             Visit 1 (screening).\n\n          6.

Patients with lung diseases other than asthma (eg COPD).\n\n          8. Patients with known active tuberculosis.\n\n          9. Patients with malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation\n             therapy or chemotherapy within the last five years prior to Visit 1 (screening).\n             Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed.\n\n         10. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a\n             history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion\n             criterion no. 1.\n\n         11.

Pregnant or nursing women, including female patients with positive \u00df-HCG test at\n             Visit 1.\n\n         15. Female patients of child-bearing potential not using highly effective method of birth\n             control. As defined in ICH (M3) [R09-1400], note 3, highly effective methods of birth\n             control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure\n             rate (ie less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as\n             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices\n             (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner. Barrier contraceptives (eg male\n             condom or diaphragm) are acceptable if used in combination with spermicides (eg foam,\n             gel).\n\n             Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically\n             sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or\n             post-menopausal for at least two years.\n\n         16. Patients who have been treated with restricted medication prior to Visit 1 and/or\n             during the screening period.\n\n         17. Patients with any asthma exacerbation or any respiratory tract infection in the four\n             weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period.\n\n             Visit 1 and/or Visit 2 should be postponed in case of an asthma exacerbation or\n             respiratory tract infection. Refer to Section 6.1 for information on re-scheduling of\n             visits.\n\n         18. Patients who are currently participating in another trial or who have been\n             participating in another trial within one month prior to Visit 0, and  patients who\n             have previously been randomised in this trial."
