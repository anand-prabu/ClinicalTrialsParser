             complete remission (CR) i. complete remission is defined per morphologic,
             cytogenetic, FISH, molecular, and radiographic imaging studies appropriate for each
             condition listed

             1. AML, ALL

          -  Normal values for absolute neutrophil count (&gt;1000/microL) and platelet count

          -  Less than 5 percent blast cells present in the bone marrow 2. MDS

          -  Bone marrow with ≤5 percent myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines

          -  Peripheral blood demonstrates hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL, platelets ≥100 x 109/L,

          -  No clonal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood by immunophenotyping

          -  bone marrow with no evidence of clonal CLL (by flow cytometry and/or
             immunohistochemistry 4. NHL

          -  No clinical evidence of disease or disease-related symptoms

          -  Typically FDG-avid lymphomas: a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted
             as long as it is PET negative.

          -  Variably FDG-avid lymphoma/FDG avidity unknown: all lymph nodes normal size by CT.

          -  Spleen and liver non-palpable and without nodules

          -  If pretreatment bone marrow biopsy was positive, repeat bone marrow biopsy must be
             negative; if morphologically indeterminate, immunohistochemistry should be negative
             If pretreatment bone marrow biopsy was positive, repeat bone marrow biopsy must be
             negative; if morphologically indeterminate, immunohistochemistry should be negative

             5. HL

          -  No clinical evidence of disease or disease-related symptoms

          -  A post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative

          -  Spleen and liver must be non-palpable and without nodules

          -  If a pre-treatment bone marrow biopsy was positive, an adequate bone marrow biopsy
             from the same site must be cleared of infiltrate; if this is indeterminate by
             morphology, immunohistochemistry should be negative 6. MM

             evidence of soft tissue plasmacytoma

             cells

          -  In patients who lack measurable M proteins in the serum and urine being monitored
             using the FLC levels, the definition of CR requires a normalization of the FLC ratio
             in addition to the above criteria ii. MDS - may have achieved CR through either
             hypomethylating agent therapy, induction chemotherapy, or other therapy iii. MDS -
             low/intermediate-1 IPSS risk category patients are eligible only if they have failed
             prior therapy or are transfusion-dependent

          -  Peripheral blood WBC greater than 2,000 per microliter (required for collection of
             dendritic cell precursors)

          -  Adequate vital organ function:

        LVEF ≥ 45% by MUGA scan FEV1, FVC, and DLCO ≥ 50% of predicted values on pulmonary
        function tests Transaminases (AST, ALT) &lt; 3 times upper limit of normal values Creatinine
        clearance ≥ 50cc/min

          -  Infectious disease criteria:

             a. No active infection; infection controlled with antimicrobial therapy is not
             excluded b. HIV negative by ELISA or RT-PCR [if ELISA is positive and RT-PCR is
             negative, the ELISA is considered false positive] c. Hepatitis B and C negative by
             serology or RT-PCR d. Must complete full screening panel: i. HIV 1, 2 serology and
             RT-PCR ii. HTLV 1,2 serology iii. RPR serology iv. EBV serology v. CMV serology vi.
             HSV serology vii.VZV serology

          -  Performance status:  Karnofsky Performance Status Score ≥ 60%.

          -  Agreement to utilize effective contraceptive methods during the study (for one year)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those with any Sorror's co-morbidity factors with score &gt; 3

          -  2 or more Sorror's factors with composite score of ≥ 3

          -  Important modification to co-morbidity index calculation

             a. DLCO will not be included in assessment of pulmonary risk, excepting those with
             DLCO &lt; 50%, who will merit a score of 3 and thereby be excluded from the trial.
