      Primary Objective: To investigate the pretreatment quantitative factors as shown in SD-OCT
      images that correlate with posttreatment VA in patients who underwent intravitreal Lucentis
      (Ranibizumab) for RVO.

      Secondary Objectives: Correlations between posttreatment BCVA and pretreatment factors were
      evaluated, including age, pretreatment BCVA, photoreceptor outer segment (PROS) length,
      central foveal thickness (CFT), outer foveal thickness (OFT), and outer nuclear layer
      thickness (ONLT). The factors influencing posttreatment BCVA were evaluated using multiple
      regression analysis.

      Detailed information on macular morphology, such as the photoreceptor IS/OS junction and
      ELM, can be obtained in SD-OCT.  Some OCT studies evaluated other quantitative factors in
      eye disease. It was reported that PROS length was correlated with BCVA in patients with
      DME.¹ Other investigators suggested that the thickness, area, and volume of the outer layer
      were correlated with BCVA in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).²
      Outer foveal thickness (OFT) and relative reflectivity of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) were
      associated with BCVA in patients with macular hole.3, 4 The volume of the ONL was found to
      be associated with BCVA in patients with AMD.5 The aim of this study was to investigate the
      pretreatment quantitative factors as shown in SD-OCT images that correlate with
      posttreatment VA in patients who underwent intravitreal Lucentis (Ranibizumab) for RVO.
