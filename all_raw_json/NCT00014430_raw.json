Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor\n      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vinorelbine plus trastuzumab in\n      treating patients who have refractory or metastatic breast cancer."

Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of vinorelbine until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-35 patients will be accrued for this study."

The HER proteins regulate cell growth, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation\u2014functions that are amplified or weakened in cancer cells. In some cancers, notably some breast cancers, HER2 is over-expressed, and causes breast cells to reproduce uncontrollably.",
