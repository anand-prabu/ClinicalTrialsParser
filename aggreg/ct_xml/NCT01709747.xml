      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of hydromorphone hydrochloride
      administered by intrathecal delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm safety study to evaluate the safety of hydromorphone
      hydrochloride given by continuous intrathecal infusion using an implantable pump device.
      This study will enroll both subjects on a current opioid intrathecal medication as well as
      na√Øve subjects now current on intrathecal opioid medications.  All subjects currently on
      intrathecal opioid treatment will be converted from their current intrathecal therapy to
      intrathecal hydromorphone hydrochloride according to standard medical practice.  After an
      optimal dose for pain relief is achieved, subjects will remain on therapy for a total of 12
      months or until discontinuation from the study. During this continuous dosing period, dose
      adjustments (up or down) are permitted to manage pain or side effects provided a maximum
      dose of 5 mg/day is not exceeded.  Subjects will be assessed for pain intensity using a
      VASPI instrument at each study visit.

      Subjects will be evaluated for side effects and clinical complications associated with the
      use of intrathecal hydromorphone.  Events will be classified by intrathecal drugs used and
      concentrations.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this trial is Safety.  There is no formal efficacy assessment planned in this open-label safety study.  The patient status will be assessed by providing a VASPI score at each study visit. Subjects who drop out provide a VASPI assessment prior to discontinuation from the study.</description>
