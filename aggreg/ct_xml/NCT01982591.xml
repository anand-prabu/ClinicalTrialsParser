    <textblock>
      This research trial studies heavy metal exposure in predicting peripheral neuropathy in
      patients with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Studying samples of blood
      and urine in the laboratory for heavy metal exposure from patients receiving chemotherapy
      may help doctors find out whether side effects from chemotherapy are related to heavy metal
      exposure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the correlation, if any, of specific heavy metals with high grade symptoms of
      peripheral neuropathy, defined as grade &gt;= 3 peripheral neuropathy, (utilizing the Common
      Terminology Criterial for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v.] 4.0) in a cohort of breast
      cancer patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant taxane chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the range of specific heavy metals in a cohort of breast cancer patients
      undergoing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy treatment.

      II. To evaluate the reproducibility of sera and urine testing of heavy metal levels by
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) testing in a cohort of breast cancer
      patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant taxane chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo serum and urine sample collection for heavy metal analysis by ICP-MS at
      baseline and at the completion of treatment. Patients also complete neurotoxicity assessment
      questionnaire at baseline and at the completion of treatment.
