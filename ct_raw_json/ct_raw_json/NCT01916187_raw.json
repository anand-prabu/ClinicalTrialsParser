Laboratory\n      studies suggest imetelstat may increase the activity of 13-cis-retinoic acid, which is used\n      to treat neuroblastoma, although this is not yet proven in patients."

It will be the responsibility of the local\n             participating investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance, and to indicate\n             in writing to the NCIC CTG Study Coordinator that such clearance has been obtained,\n             before the trial can commence in that centre.\n\n          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this\n             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there\n             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: two hour's driving distance)\n             placed on patients being considered for this trial.\n\n          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days of patient registration.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with >25% bone marrow involvement will not be enrolled.\n\n          -  Patients must be able to take oral medication and have no gastrointestinal\n             abnormalities (e.g. bowel obstruction or previous gastric resection) which would lead\n             to inadequate absorption of 13-cisretinoic acid.\n\n          -  Known HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections.\n\n          -  Imetelstat animal and in vitro studies suggest it is not genotoxic or teratogenic.\n             However, 13-cis-retinoic acid is known to be teratogenic. Pregnancy tests must be\n             obtained in girls who are post menarchal. Males or females of reproductive potential\n             may not participate unless they have agreed to use two reliable contraceptive\n             methods. Pregnant or breast-feeding females will not be entered on this study due to\n             the potential fetal and teratogenic adverse effects.\n\n          -  Concurrent Medications:\n\n               -  Patients receiving other investigational agents will not be enrolled.\n\n               -  Patient receiving other anti-cancer agents will not be enrolled.\n\n               -  Patients with CNS metastasis will need to submit to a baseline MRI obtained\n                  within 21 days prior to registration. Patients with evidence of current or prior\n                  CNS hemorrhage will be excluded. Patients who in the opinion of the investigator\n                  may not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study\n                  will not be enrolled."
