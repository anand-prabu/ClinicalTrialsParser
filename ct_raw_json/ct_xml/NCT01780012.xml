  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by reduced bone mass and increased skeletal
      fragility, predisposing to an increased fracture risk. The presence of a low trauma fracture
      is a powerfull predictor of future fractures and about 50% of patients with a fragility
      fracture will suffer a subsequent fracture in the next 10 years (Center JR, 2007).
      Osteoporotic fractures are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality but also
      high financial costs. However, less than 20% of patients presenting a low trauma fracture
      receive an appropriate post-fracture osteoporosis management (Little and Eccles, 2010). The
      hypothesis of a lack of information and an under assessment of consequences by both patients
      and physicians has been raised to explain this gap between recommanded care and usual
      practices.

      The aim of the PREVOST program is to assess the efficiency of patient-centered osteoporosis
      prevention program, after a fragility fracture of the upper limb, to improve post-fracture
      management of osteoporosis (ie BMD test and / or osteoporosis treatment) in women over 50
      years old.

      This open randomized controlled trial aims to compare the BMD or osteoporosis treatment
      prescription rate at 6 months after inclusion between two groups: &quot;intervention&quot; receiving
      information on fracture and osteoporosis (oral and written), phone call reminders and
      written information to give to their family physician, and &quot;control&quot; receiving usual care
      without information.
