Previous studies have shown that weight loss via lifestyle\n      modifications is associated with a decrease in large artery (aorta) stiffness. However,\n      along with decreases in fat mass, hypocaloric diet reduces muscle mass. Whole body vibration\n      results in similar increases in muscle mass and strength than those observed after\n      resistance exercise and is feasible for special populations such as the obese and the\n      elderly.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis is that weight loss via diet combined with whole body vibration\n      training would additively reduce arterial stiffness and blood pressure in obese women. The\n      investigators also hypothesize that the improved arterial function with weight loss would be\n      associated with beneficial changes in the main mechanisms involved in BP regulation."

Static exercises will be performed without movement in the joint angles described previously.
