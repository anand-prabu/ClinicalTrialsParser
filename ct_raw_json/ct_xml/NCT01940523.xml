  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether topical or intravenous administration of
      tranexamic acid during unilateral total knee replacement is more effective at reducing
      bleeding in the first 24 hours following surgery. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic drug that
      has been shown to reduce blood drain output and the need for blood transfusions in both its
      topical and intravenous forms and is commonly used in orthopedic surgery. We hypothesize
      that IV and topical administration of tranexamic acid will be equally good at reducing the
      loss of blood and the need for transfusion immediately following total knee replacement.

      This randomized controlled trial compares the blood loss of patients undergoing unilateral
      total knee replacements who randomly receive either the topical or the intravenous form of
      tranexmamic acid during surgery. Patients in the intravenous arm of the study will receive 1
      gram of tranexamic acid in 10 milliliters of solution prior to inflation of the tourniquet
      and 1 gram of tranexamic acid in 10 milliliters of solution during closure. For patients in
      the topical arm of the study, prior to the release of the tourniquet they will receive 3
      grams of tranexamic acid in 75ccs of solution directly on the site of the incision.

      The primary result measurement will be blood drain output from the knee at 24 hours after
      surgery.

    <description>The amount of blood lost during surgery is the primary outcome measure. Blood loss is determineusing an equation that calculates the patient's blood volume based on their height and weight, then multiplies the patient's blood volume by the change in their hematocrit after surgery compared to before surgery.</description>

    <description>3 vials of tranexamic acid (1g tranexamic acid in 10cc each) must be mixed in the operating room by the team at the start of surgery with 45cc of saline solution (for a total of 3g tranexamic acid in 75mL solution). This solution will be applied to the open joint surfaces with two 60mL syringes (one with 60mL and one with 15m). The solution will be left in contact with the tissues for five minutes. The surgeon will suction away excess solution. The site may be irrigated before or after the tranexamic acid bath as long as the solution is in contact for at least five full minutes. After that, the tourniquet will be released and the rest of the surgery will proceed according to the standard of care.</description>
