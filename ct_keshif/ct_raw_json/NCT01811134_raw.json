A new\n      endovascular technique has recently been developed, using flow diverter stents without\n      associated coils. Clinical results already published are encouraging but have to be\n      confirmed. Furthermore, these medical devices are expensive in comparison to the coiling\n      strategy. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and\n      cost-effectiveness of endovascular coiling and endovascular flow diversion for unrupted\n      saccular intracranial aneurysms."
