    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, North and South America, Asia and Europe. The purpose of
      the trial is to compare the effect of once-weekly dosing of two dose levels of semaglutide
      versus insulin glargine once-daily on glycaemic control after 30 weeks of treatment in
      insulin-naïve subjects with type 2 diabetes.
