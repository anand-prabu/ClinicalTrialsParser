The investigators hypothesize that smokers that receive multiple TTA visits will be\n      more likely to (1) use smoking cessation resources and (2) quit compared to smokers who\n      receive a single visit."

All smokers who\n      enroll in the study at a particular PHD receive the same intervention. Smokers at control\n      sites receive written materials that offer strategies for quitting and information about\n      availability of treatment programs, as well as a one-time meeting with a Tobacco Treatment\n      Advocate (TTA). The intervention group receives the same written materials but also has much\n      more extensive interactions with a TTA. TTAs provide peer counseling (Peer Counseling is\n      defined as: performance of limited counselor functions, under counselor supervision, by\n      person of similar age,gender, race, ethnicity and/or SES of  the counselee) to smokers\n      during in- person Motivational Enhancement meetings (target range 7-9) as well as additional\n      in person and phone contacts, as needed for each participant, over a 6-month period. TTAs\n      receive intensive training in motivational interviewing and smoking cessation counseling\n      deliver the intervention components (counseling activities and provision of environmental\n      supports) in addition to encouraging utilization of smoking cessation treatment programs\n      such as the Smokers' QuitLine (SQL) and clinic-based programs. In order to avoid the\n      potential for contamination due to TTAs interacting with participants at both intervention\n      and control sites, meetings with participants at control sites are conducted by special\n      Control TTAs. Data are collected from study participants at baseline, 3 months, 7 months and\n      12 months, and also from the SQL and clinics."
