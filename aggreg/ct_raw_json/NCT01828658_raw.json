In the\n      interventional arm, the prescribed dry weights of the patients were strictly maintained  in\n      the ideal weight interval (+/- 1.1 kg) proposed by the BCM device.\n\n      Primary outcome was all cause-mortality compared in the strict bioimpedance  arm versus the\n      clinical  (control) arm and was assessed at 2,5 years.\n\n      Secondary end-points, assessed during the randomization period (2,5 years), were to compare\n      blood pressure (determined pre dialysis), arterial stiffness  and relative fluid overload\n      (RFO = overhydration/ total body water), as measured by the BCM device.\n\n      During the last year of the study, all patients were left free of any intervention, and only\n      arterial stiffness was assessed a third time at 3,5 years."
