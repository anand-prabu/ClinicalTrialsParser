To compare the time to progression(TTP).\n\n        2. To compare the tumor response and disease control rate according to Response Evaluation\n           Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST), modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid\n           Tumors(mRECIST) and European Association of Liver Disease(EASL) criteria.\n\n        3.

To explore the prognostic value of AFP response after treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase 3, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Patients undergo the first conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)\n      within 3-7 days after the first administration of sorafenib. The conventional TACE consists\n      of an injection containing a mixture of chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin) and lipiodol\n      followed by embolization with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) until complete stasis was achieved in\n      the tumor-feeding vessels. Tumor-feeding vessels should be selected/superselected whenever\n      possible. TACE will be repeated \"on demand\" depending on the radiological response.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive two tablets of sorafenib (200 mg tablets) twice daily (each morning\n      and evening).\n\n      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Standard follow-up evaluations include contrast-enhanced CT scan and\n      laboratory assessment. Laboratory assessment will be performed every 4 weeks. Radiological\n      follow-up (contrast-enhanced CT scan in liver and chest X-ray) will be performed during week\n      4 and week 8 after initiation of treatment and thereafter every 8 weeks."
