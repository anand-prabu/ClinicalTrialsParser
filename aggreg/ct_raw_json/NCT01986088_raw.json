The goal of the current study was to extend the findings of that study by examining\n      the efficacy of eletriptan compared with both 50- and 100-mg doses of sumatriptan; and to\n      evaluate the comparative efficacy of eletriptan and sumatriptan across additional important\n      clinical outcomes. In particular, early response (at 1 hour), sustained response (without\n      need for additional treatment) at 24 hours, and consistency of response across multiple\n      attacks were examined."
