  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Providing feedback on patient progress to therapists improves clinical outcomes for
      patients, particularly those who are failing to improve with therapy. The encouraging
      research has been carried out by a small group of researchers, largely working in the United
      States health care context. The samples studied have been young people attending university
      counselling services, suffering from mild mental health disorders. The group studies are
      therefore not similar to patients seen for psychological therapy in the NHS. Also given that
      therapists are not necessarily alert to treatment failure, have an overly optimistic view of
      their patients progress even when provided with evidence to the contrary, clinical
      supervision may be a more effective method through which to provide patient informed
      clinical outcomes than directly to therapists themselves.

      We will assess if providing feedback through the supervision process is more effective than
      providing this information to therapists themselves in terms of improving clinical outcomes,
      particularly for patients who are failing to improve with routine NHS Psychological therapy.
