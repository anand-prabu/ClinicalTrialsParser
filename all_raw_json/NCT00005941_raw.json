            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, and radiation therapy\n      before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.\n      It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated\n      stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer\n      cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor\n      lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the\n      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal\n      cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from\n      happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well donor peripheral stem cell transplant plus\n      chemotherapy and total-body irradiation followed by donor white blood cell infusion work in\n      treating patients with recurrent metastatic or locally advanced cancer of the cervix or\n      vagina that is associated with human papillomavirus."

Filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic peripheral\n      blood stem cells are infused on day 0.\n\n      Patients also receive oral cyclosporine twice daily on days -3 to 35 and then tapered until\n      day 56. Mycophenolate mofetil is administered orally twice daily on days 0-27.\n\n      Patients with disease progression and no graft-versus-host disease on day 56 receive\n      nonmobilized donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) over 30 minutes on day 65. DLI may be repeated\n      every 65 days for up to 4 doses.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, monthly for 6 months, every 6 months for 2 years,\n      and then annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study."
