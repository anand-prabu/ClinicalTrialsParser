            "textblock": "IL-12 has a number of effects in vitro that could be relevant to HIV disease including\n      promotion of TH1 cell development, enhancement of HIV-specific T cell responses in cells\n      from subjects with AIDS, and, of particular relevance to MAC disease, increasing secretion\n      of cytotoxic cytokines such as IFN-gamma from both T lymphocytes and NK cells.\n\n      Part A (36 patients with less than 50 CD4+ cells/mm3):\n\n      Patients are randomized within one of three sequential dose cohorts and receive either\n      rhIL-12 or matching placebo by subcutaneous injection twice weekly for four weeks. Eligible\n      patients will participate in only 1 of the 3 dosing cohorts. Dose escalation to a new cohort\n      of patients in Part A will occur only if all 3 of the following occur:\n\n      (1) At least 9 patients in the rhIL-12 arm have been enrolled in the current dose group and\n      have either been on study drug for at least 4 weeks (temporary discontinuation is allowed)\n      or have permanently discontinued study drug due to a primary toxicity endpoint.\n\n      [(2) AS PER AMENDMENT 6/16/97: Fewer than 2 of the 12 patients receiving rhIL-12 at 30 or\n      100 ng/kg have had a primary toxicity endpoint.] (3) Adequate data from a Genetics\n      Institute/Wyeth Ayerst-sponsored dose escalation trial have been obtained and analyzed to\n      demonstrate the safety of the dose to be administered to the next cohort.\n\n      Note: If 3 or more patients in the rhIL-12 arm of a given dose in Part A experience a\n      primary toxicity endpoint, then accrual and further drug administration will be\n      discontinued.\n\n      [AS PER AMENDMENT 6/16/97: If a cohort has exactly two patients in the rhIL-12 arm that\n      experience a primary toxicity endpoint, then the next cohort receives study drug at the same\n      dose as the current cohort, but administered only once a week. If a cohort receiving study\n      drug administered once a week has at least two subjects experience a primary toxicity\n      endpoint, then further drug administration in Part A is stopped. Any cohort that receives\n      study drug once a week is the last cohort in Part A; no further dose escalation is\n      performed].\n\n      Part B (18 subjects with 300-500 CD4+ cells/mm3):\n\n      Patients are randomized to receive either the maximum tolerated dose (determined in Part A)\n      of rhIL-12 or matching placebo subcutaneously twice a week for 4 weeks.\n\n      [AS PER AMENDMENT 01/29/99: Because of slow accrual for cohort 3 of Part A, concurrent\n      enrollment will begin for Part B while cohort 3 of Part A is completed.  There will be no\n      further dose escalation in Part A.  Part A will remain open to accrual until the final\n      enrollee to Part B completes 4 weeks of study treatment.  For Part B, 27 patients will be\n      randomized with equal probability to one of two rhIL-12 doses or placebo.  Semiweekly\n      injections are given for 4 weeks.]"
