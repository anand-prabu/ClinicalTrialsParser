Inflamm Bowel Dis 2008; 14: 542-549), the\n      incidence and prevalence of IBD in Korea are still low compared with those in Western\n      countries, but are rapidly increasing. However, the long-term trends of epidemiology of CD\n      and UC together with their characteristics and prognosis in Korea are uncertain yet. The\n      investigators therefore aim to elucidate the incidence and prevalence of CD and UC over a\n      30-year period, from 1986 to 2017, in the Songpa-Kangdong district of Seoul, Korea. In\n      addition, the investigators also aim to reveal the clinical features at the time of\n      diagnosis of IBD, long-term evolution of disease and prognosis."
