However, health coaching has not been adequately assessed in\n      the community health care setting in individuals with T2DM. The purpose of this study is to\n      determine the effect of diabetes health coaching in adults with T2DM in the community health\n      care setting on clinical outcomes, self-care behaviours and health care utilization.\n\n      Research Questions: In adults with T2DM who are referred to a community based diabetes\n      program, does assignment to a diabetes health coach that provides remotely delivered\n      frequent personalized education and support, behaviour modification counselling and\n      reinforcement, and psychosocial support improve glycated hemoglobin (A1C) over diabetes\n      education alone? Secondary Questions include: i) Does the assignment to a diabetes health\n      coach improve: a) body mass index (BMI); b) diabetes self-care activities; and c) quality of\n      life, more than standard diabetes self-management education alone after one year? ii) What\n      is the incremental cost-effectiveness of the diabetes health coach relative to standard\n      diabetes self-management education?\n\n      Proposed Design and Intervention:\n\n      The study design will be an open-label randomized controlled trial of adults with T2DM in a\n      Community Health Centre (CHC) setting. Upon randomization to the intervention group, study\n      participants will receive one-year access to diabetes health coaching, which comprises: a)\n      weekly access to a coach, via secured messaging or telephone; b) diabetes case management;\n      c) personalized diabetes education; d) behaviour modification, goal setting and\n      reinforcement; and d) psychosocial support. All study participants will have access to their\n      standard diabetes care and access to the Virtual Lifestyle Management program, an internet\n      based deliverable program which comprises the National Institutes of Health's Diabetes\n      Prevention Program (DPP) protocol and curriculum, proven to be effective for weight\n      management. Education includes 24 modules with streaming audio narration; and b) tracking\n      tools to record dietary and physical activity results. All participants will also receive an\n      accelerometer to measure physical activity (steps).\n\n      Outcome:\n\n      The primary outcome is the difference the mean A1C in the diabetes health coaching program,\n      compared to the mean A1C in the control group at 1 year. Secondary outcomes will include: a)\n      BMI; b) diabetes self-care activities; c) quality of life; and d) cost-effectiveness.\n\n      Implications:\n\n      The findings from this trial may support a new strategy to complement and/or enhance\n      diabetes self-management services in the community.  Coaching may be delivered remotely and\n      may demonstrate to be a cost-effective or cost-neutral service to support those living with\n      diabetes."
