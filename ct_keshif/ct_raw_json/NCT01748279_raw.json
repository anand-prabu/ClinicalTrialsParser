All subjects will have spirometry, lung volumes, DLCO, SGRQ, 6MWD,\n      serum lipids and hs-CRP measured before and after treatment. Bronchoscopy and transbronchial\n      lung biopsy (TBB) will be carried out at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment, and TBB\n      specimens will be processed for histology, immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis."
