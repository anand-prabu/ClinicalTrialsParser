Preoperative MRI and targeted biopsies + random biopsies .\n\n        2. Random biopsies (gold standard).\n\n      Only patients with a positive MRI were included in this collateral study.\n\n      The cytological imprints (negative/positive) of each targeted biopsy is compared to the\n      histology (negative/positive) and Gleason score."
