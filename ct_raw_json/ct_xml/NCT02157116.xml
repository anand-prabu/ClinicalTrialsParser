  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dose-dense chemotherapy is a chemotherapy treatment plan in which drugs are given with less
      time between treatments than in standard chemotherapy.  The two chemotherapy drugs used in
      this study, docetaxel and cisplatin, are approved for the treatment of lung cancer when
      given every 21 days.  This study is exploring the response to chemotherapy when these drugs
      are given every 14 days.   In addition, genetic tests will be performed on pre-treatment
      specimens to identify signatures that may predict chemotherapy sensitivity or resistance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive induction chemotherapy with cisplatin  and docetaxel.
      Pegfilgrastim will be administered approximately 24 hours following the end of the day 1
      chemotherapy infusion.  Cycles will be repeated every 2 weeks for 3 cycles. Patients deemed
      to be resectable will undergo surgical resection followed by postoperative thoracic
      radiotherapy. Patients deemed inoperable will additionally receive concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy. Response, using radiographic and/or pathologic means, will identify two
      cohorts; responders and nonresponders.Gene expression profiling will then be performed on
      pre-treatment specimens to identify signatures that predict for chemotherapy sensitivity or
      resistance.
