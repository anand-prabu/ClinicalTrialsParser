      The Objective of this study is to investigate the long-term efficacy of intranasal oxytocin
      in improvement of symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who have residual symptoms dispute
      being on adequate treatment with antipsychotic medication.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The three subscales of the PANSS include the Positive scale (7 items), the Negative scale (7 items), and the General Psychopathology scale (16 items). The total PANSS score is the sum of all 30 items of which each item is scored on a 1-7 rating system (7 indicating the worst symptoms). The items on the PANSS focus on symptoms that are common in patients with psychotic disorders and include hallucinations, delusions and disorganization as well as mood disturbances.</description>
