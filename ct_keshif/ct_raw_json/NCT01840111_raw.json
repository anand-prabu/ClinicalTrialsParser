            "textblock": "The overarching goals of this proposal are to 1) identify the network of brain regions\n      specifically activated by personal smoking environment cues and 2) to evaluate the effects\n      of exposure to these cues on smoke self-administration and subjective reactivity. The\n      results of this study will inform the development of novel and more efficacious\n      cue-exposures therapies targeted at helping smokers quit smoking and will provide novel\n      mechanism information regarding the influence of environmental context on drug taking.\n\n      The investigator hypothesizes that cue-exposure treatments (CETs), in which drug use is\n      prevented during exposure to drug cues (e.g. lit cigarette) have been of limited efficacy in\n      part because they have not included cues representative of the contexts in which drug use\n      occurs. By demonstrating that context cues have a differential and robust influence on brain\n      and behavioral responses, we will have provided a substantial basis for including such\n      stimuli in the context of treatment. At the same time, we will have identified novel\n      mechanisms by which such stimuli promote continued drug use and relapse."
