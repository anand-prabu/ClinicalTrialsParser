This system includes the FDA-cleared Visualase Cooled Laser Applicator System\n      (VCLAS), which allows delivery of laser energy while the patient is being imaged by an MRI\n      unit. The Visualase\u00ae System works via real-time MR thermal imaging (MRTI) to provide\n      information on the thermal dose delivered to the target, resulting in a more precise and\n      controlled delivery which has heretofore not been possible with previous non-image guided\n      laser technology. We hypothesize that the Visualase system can be used in patients\n      refractory to medication therapy in a minimally invasive procedure to destroy epileptogenic\n      focal lesions in the brain."
