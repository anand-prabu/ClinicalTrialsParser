      The purpose of this study is to assess the changes in language processing of patients with
      chronic, post-stroke aphasia following the application of brain stimulation. The brain
      stimulation the investigators administer is called transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS). It involves passing a weak electrical current through the brain between two
      electrodes in the form of damp sponges. One sponge will be placed over a specified area on
      the damaged left hemisphere, while the other sponge will be placed on the right scalp.
      Computer-controlled speech-language treatment will be administered during the application of
      tDCS.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States. Approximately
      one-third of all strokes result in acute language impairment (aphasia), with approximately
      one-fifth suffering from chronic aphasia. Unfortunately, the prognosis for moderate to
      severe chronic aphasia remains grim, as current behavioral treatment approaches usually
      offer only limited-to-modest benefit. Recent advancements in understanding the relationship
      between low current electrical brain stimulation and cortical plasticity suggest that the
      effect of behavioral aphasia treatment could possibly be enhanced using anodal transcranial
      direct current stimulation (A-tDCS). Indeed, we have shown how A-tDCS can significantly
      boost the effect of behavioral aphasia treatment. Based on these results as well as our
      other studies aimed at understanding how favorable brain plasticity correlates with positive
      treatment outcome in aphasia, we propose to conduct a Phase II clinical trial utilizing a
      futility design. Consistent with the goals of Program Announcement PAR-08-204 by the
      National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), we plan to
      &quot;evaluate whether there is sufficient evidence of short term improvement in humans to
      justify a phase III trial.&quot;
