            "textblock": "Effectiveness of screening colonoscopy in cancer prevention relies on the detection and\n      removal of adenomatous polyps. However, a substantial rate of adenomas is missed during a\n      colonoscopy. It has been estimated that two thirds of missed adenomas are located on the\n      proximal aspect of colonic folds. Attaching a transparent cap to the tip of a colonoscope\n      may allow examination of the proximal aspect of colonic folds, and some early studies have\n      suggested an increased polyp and adenoma detection using this technology. However, the\n      studies have in part substantial methodological limitations (e.g. missing polyp histology,\n      single endoscopist study, polyps not removed at the time of detection). Therefore, at this\n      point it is unclear whether cap assisted colonoscopy may improve adenoma detection. The\n      objective of this study is to evaluate whether cap assisted colonoscopy improves adenoma\n      detection.\n\n      The investigators propose a two-center multiple endoscopists randomized controlled trial.\n      Patients will be randomized to cap assisted colonoscopy or standard high definition white\n      light colonoscopy. The cap is a 4mm commercially available transparent cap that is attached\n      to the tip of the colonoscopy. Primary outcome measure is the adenoma detection rate (mean\n      number of adenoma per patient). The investigators will assess and adjust for possible\n      variables that can affect adenoma detection, including withdrawal time and quality of colon\n      preparation. As a secondary outcome of interest the investigators will evaluate a possible\n      learning curve effect among all endoscopists (a minimum of six) new to this method. In\n      addition the investigators will evaluate whether cap assisted endoscopy improves real time\n      prediction of polyp histology."

Patients will be randomized to one of two\n      groups:\n\n        1. Standard colonoscopy, or\n\n        2. Cap assisted colonoscopy. All colonoscopies will be performed using state of the art\n           high-definition wide angle colonoscopy. The transparent cap, which is attached to the\n           tip of the colonoscope, has a 4mm margin extending beyond the tip of the colonoscope.\n           All patients will undergo a careful endoscopic examination. A timer will provide\n           feedback on the time of insertion and the withdrawal time. Detected polyps will be\n           assessed with standard white light and narrow band imaging to predict polyp histology\n           (adenoma versus no adenoma), then resected and sent for histological evaluation\n           according to standard of care. At least 8 experienced endoscopists at the participating\n           centers will participate. Each endoscopist will perform  at least 50 cap assisted\n           colonoscopies as part of the study. Each endoscopist will be asked to complete a survey\n           after 10 and after 50 cap assisted colonoscopies.\n\n      Patients will be randomized in blocks of four allocated to each examiner. The order of\n      randomization will be computer generated. Information on randomization will be contained in\n      sealed envelopes assigned to each examiner and individually opened immediately before the\n      procedure after a patient's All participating endoscopist will fill out a questionnaire\n      regarding the use of cap assistance colonoscopy after the initial 10 cap assisted\n      colonoscopies and after at least 50 cap assisted cap colonoscopies. Endoscopists will also\n      undergo a training session with respect to real time polyp diagnosis before study\n      commencement and after each 20 colonoscopies enrollment."
