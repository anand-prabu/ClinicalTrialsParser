Determine immune reactivity in HLA-A2 positive patients with resectable stage\n      IIA or IIB melanoma treated with vaccine comprising tyrosinase peptide and gp100 antigen\n      emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51) alone or in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF).\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage\n      (IIA vs IIB). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive\n      vaccine comprising tyrosinase peptide and gp100 antigen emulsified in Montanide ISA-51\n      (ISA-51) alone subcutaneously (SQ) once a week on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 26. Arm\n      II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) SQ for 5 days\n      after each vaccination. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for\n      3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      3 years."
