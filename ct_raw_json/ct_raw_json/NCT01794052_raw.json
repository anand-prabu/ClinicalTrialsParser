Although these\n      two conditions can be detected much early in life and are amenable to interventions at\n      primary health care level, the health system in India fails to provide adequate\n      interventions at primary health care level which translates to huge burden of undiagnosed\n      and uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes in the community. This study aims to design a\n      feasible and sustainable evidence-based, decision support-enabled, health care delivery\n      model for the management of hypertension and diabetes in the primary health care facilities\n      of Himachal Pradesh. The study will be conducted at the 5 Community Health Centers (CHCs)\n      and District Hospital of Solan District, Himachal Pradesh using both qualitative and\n      quantitative methods. The design and development of the model will be carried out in the\n      initial six months followed by piloting the services at the CHCs and District Hospital. The\n      impact of the model on quality of care will be assessed in a pre-post design measuring\n      changes in both clinical and process indicators."
