Giving the drugs directly into the tumor after surgery and\n      combining them with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining surgery, chemotherapy, and\n      radiation therapy in treating patients who have peritoneal cancer."

Approximately 3-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive intraperitoneal (IP)\n      chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin IP over 2 hours once weekly on weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10\n      and cisplatin IP and gemcitabine IP once weekly on weeks 2, 5, 8, and 11. Patients also\n      receive interferon gamma IP once weekly on weeks 13-16.\n\n      At approximately week 18-20, patients undergo second-look surgery. Patients with no gross\n      disease receive hyperthermia mitomycin IP and cisplatin IP over 90 minutes.\n\n      Approximately 2-4 weeks after second-look surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a\n      week for 5-7 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study."
