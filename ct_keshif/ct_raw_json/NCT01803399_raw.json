The primary objective of this study is to separately\n      assess the effects of a therapeutic and supratherapeutic dose of GSK1322322 on the cardiac\n      conduction (corrected QT interval [QTc]) compared with placebo in eligible healthy male and\n      female subjects. Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) will be used as an open-label positive\n      control in order to validate the sensitivity of the study in detecting QTc change.\n      Approximately 56 healthy subjects will participate in the study for approximately 9 weeks\n      i.e. 30 day Screening period, 4-week Treatment period, and a 7-10 day Follow-up period.\n      There will be 4 treatment periods separated by at least 1 week. Subjects will be admitted to\n      the clinical unit on Day -1 of each dosing period. Each subject will receive each of the\n      four treatment sequences (GSK1322322 1200 milligram [mg] intravenous [IV] over 60 minutes x\n      1 dose, GSK1322322 3000 mg IV over 60 minutes x 1 dose, GSK1322322 Placebo IV over 60\n      minutes x 1 dose, moxifloxacin 400 mg administered orally x 1 dose) on Day 1 of each\n      Treatment period in a randomized fashion. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous\n      Holter monitoring, laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and serial pharmacokinetic\n      samples will be collected for up to 24 hours following each treatment. If no clinically\n      significant abnormalities are noted, subjects will be discharged from the clinical research\n      unit after the completion of all assessments on Day 2 in each period and return\n      approximately one week later for the next dosing period. Each individual subject will follow\n      the same dosing schedule at every period. A Follow-up visit will be conducted 7-10 days\n      after administration of the last dose of study medication in treatment period 4."
