Compare the percentage of patients whose fever\n      defervesces and who have no signs or symptoms of infection with and without therapeutic\n      modification. III. Compare the percentage of survival of patients treated with these 2\n      regimens with no therapeutic modifications. IV. Compare the overall survival of patients\n      treated with these 2 regimens regardless of therapeutic modifications. V. Compare the time\n      to resolution of fever in patients treated with these regimens. VI. Compare the\n      microbiologic response by pathogen and site of infection in patients treated with these\n      regimens. VII. Compare the percentage of patients whose fever defervesces only after\n      resolution of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count at least 500/mm3) with no therapeutic\n      modification.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to type of malignancy (solid tumor, including lymphoma vs leukemia), prior\n      prophylactic antibiotics (yes vs no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to\n      one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive levofloxacin IV over 90 minutes once\n      daily for 14-28 days. Arm II: Patients receive cefepime IV over 30 minutes every 8 hours for\n      14-28 days. Patients may receive additional antifungal, antibacterial, or antiviral therapy\n      if condition has deteriorated, no response is seen in 72 hours, or and infection is\n      suspected or documented. Patients are followed at 1-3 and 7-12 days and then at 3-4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 260-400 patients (130-200 per treatment arm) will be\n      accrued for this study."
