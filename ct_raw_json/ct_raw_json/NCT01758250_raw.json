The microvascular changes will be compared to overall\n      treatment response in patients with scleroderma and chronic GVHD as assessments will be made\n      before and after the patients start treatment for their diseases and determine if these\n      imaging techniques provide valuable and reproducible data when assessing a patient's\n      response to treatment for those diseases.  In addition, the application of Acoustic\n      Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) in determining cutaneous thickness in patients with SSc, GVHD\n      and morphea will be evaluated.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the vascular and dermal structures are altered in\n      patients with autoimmune disease, SCD and chronic GVHD. In addition, they hypothesize that\n      imaging modalities such as LDF, LDI, OCT, NVC, OPSI and ARFI can quantify such structural\n      alterations and can be used to 1) detect early disease activity, 2) quantify and assess\n      response to therapy and 3) quantify and correlate with overall disease activity."
