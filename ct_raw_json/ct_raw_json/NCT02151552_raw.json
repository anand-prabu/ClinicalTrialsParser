PET is\n      a machine that detects radiation and generates pictures using a donut-shaped scanner similar\n      in appearance to an x-ray \"CAT\" or computed tomography (CT) scan or an MRI.  Inflammation is\n      the way our bodies react to irritation or injury, and involves red, warm, and often painful\n      swelling of the affected tissue.  An enzyme called inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)\n      contributes to the development of lung inflammation."

            "textblock": "The investigators plan to use three radioactive tracers to produce the PET images for\n      measuring lung inflammation:  [18F](+/-)NOS (the F stands for fluorine and NOS stands for\n      Nitric Oxide Synthase, which targets iNOS), O-15 carbon monoxide ([15O]CO), and O-15 water\n      ([15O]H2O).  The NOS tracer gives information specifically about lung inflammation, while\n      the carbon monoxide and water tracers give information about whether the lung inflammation\n      causes more blood or water to be retained in the area of lung inflammation.\n\n      In order to show that [18F](+/-)NOS-PET is related to the amount of inflammation, the\n      investigators first need to create a state of controlled lung inflammation that can be\n      measured and quantified.  \"Controlled lung inflammation\" means a reaction in the lungs that\n      is similar to that which occurs during lung infection (increased respiratory secretions and\n      cough).  It is \"controlled\" because the investigators will not be using anything alive or\n      contagious (it does not spread from one part of the body to another, and cannot spread to\n      another person), and a small area in only one lung will be affected.  In order to created\n      this state of controlled lung inflammation, the investigators plan to place a small amount\n      of a purified bacterial substance called endotoxin into a single small section of the lung\n      using a bronchoscope (a long, flexible narrow tube that is passed through the mouth into the\n      airways of the lung).  This use of endotoxin is considered investigational, and the\n      investigators have received permission from the FDA to use endotoxin in this research study."
