    <description>To assess the safety of treatment with allogeneic stem cells from adipose tissue in acute ischemic stroke patients (Follow-up 24 months):
Adverse events (AES) reported spontaneously or in response to questions not addressed. Serious adverse events.  These will be recorded in each visit during all the study period (24 months).
Neurological and systemic complications: deteriorating stroke, stroke recurrences, brain oedema, seizures, hemorrhagic transformation, respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, gastrointestinal haemorrhage… These will be recorded in each visit during all the study period (24 months).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Male or female acute ischemic patients aged 60-80 years with symptoms of acute
             cerebral infarction of less than 12h from stroke onset. If the time of symptom onset
             is unknown, it shall refer to the last time the patient was asymptomatic seen.

          -  Patients should be treated within two weeks from the onset of stroke symptoms.

          -  Patients with a measurable focal neurological that must persist to the time of
             treatment without clinically meaningful improvement.

          -  Patients must have computerized tomography (CT) and / or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) compatible with the clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke in the
             territory of the middle cerebral artery before being included in the study.

          -  Patients must have a score on the NIH Stroke Scale 8-20, with at least 2 of these
             points in Sections 5 and 6 (motor deficit) at the time of inclusion.

          -  Immediately (i.e. few minutes) before the stroke, patients should have a score on the
             mRS ≤ 1 (no symptoms at all or no significant disability despite symptoms, able to
             perform everyday tasks and activities).

          -  Women of childbearing age should have a negative pregnancy test performed prior to
             inclusion.

          -  Obtaining informed consent signed (after a detailed explanation of the nature and
             purpose of this study, the patient or guardian or legal representative must give
             their consent to participate by signing the informed consent document). Assent from a
             relative or career if the patient is unable to give meaningful consent (e.g. in cases
             of dysphasia, confusion, or reduced conscious level).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Comatose patients. Patients with a score of 2 or more in the item 1a of the NIHSS
             related to the degree of awareness.

          -  Evidence on neuroimaging (CT or MRI) of brain tumour, cerebral oedema with midline
             shift and clinically significant compression of ventricles, cerebellar infarction or
             brainstem, or intraventricular, intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage.

          -  Current drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.·        Active
             infectious disease, including HIV, hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, etc.

          -  Pre-existing dementia.

          -  Specify health status or any clinical conditions (e.g., life expectancy, co-existing
             disease) or other characteristics that precludes appropriate diagnosis, treatment or
             follow-up in the trial.

          -  Patients who are participating in another clinical trial.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of individual or legal guardian/representative to give
             written informed consent.
