Previous studies have showed, that\n      IPS has an effect on employment when offered to people with severe mental illness. Further\n      studies are crucial to demonstrate whether the modified IPS, the Sherpa method, has an\n      effect when offered to people with affective disorders or anxiety disorders who are not yet\n      chronified.\n\n      Methods/design:The trial design is a randomized, assessor-blinded, clinical trial of the\n      Sherpa method in addition to treatment as usual compared to treatment as usual alone for 434\n      participants diagnosed with an affective disorder or anxiety disorder, living in the Capital\n      Region of Denmark. The primary outcome is competitive employment or education. Secondary\n      outcomes are days of competitive employment or education, disease symptoms, level of\n      functioning, quality of life, empowerment, number and duration of hospital admissions and\n      out-patient treatment at follow-up 12 and 24 months after baseline."
