Tissue and cells are examined for p53 mutation\n      and DNA microsatellite repeat alterations. Patients undergo adjuvant radiotherapy and/or\n      chemotherapy, as appropriate for clinical staging and histopathology, at the discretion of\n      the participating clinician.\n\n      Patients do not receive results of genetic testing and the results do not affect treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total 530 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years."
