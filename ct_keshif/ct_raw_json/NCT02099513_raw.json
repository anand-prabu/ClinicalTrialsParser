This will\n      allow for just-in-time interventions that adapt both the content and timing, not just\n      initially, but also over time based upon prior outcome data, responses to an intervention,\n      current environmental and social context, activity level, location, time, and an\n      individual's psychophysiological state.1,2\n\n      Aim 1: To develop the initial interface of the mobile health platform that will allow\n      patients to report and receive data representing multiple health domains including blood\n      pressure, pO2 (pulse oximeter), values, weight, physical activity, calories burned, sleep,\n      and self-report survey measures such as pain and fatigue.\n\n      Aim 2: To assess feasibility of the mobile health platform to receive and deliver data\n      representing multiple health domains over 1 month through a single-case study design (N=6).3\n      Aim 3:  To develop an algorithm using the diet data collected in Aim 1 that will facilitate\n      adaptive work by providing patients with automated real time feedback on their progress.\n\n      Aim 4: To develop an algorithm using the diet data collected in Aim 1 that will that will\n      facilitate adaptive approaches by alerting clinicians on the progress of their patients."

Participants will also\n      collect blood pressure (BP), pO2, and pulse using the iHealth blood pressure device.\n      Physical activity and sleep activity will be measured using the fitbit device.
