Sometimes the transplanted cells can\n      make an immune response against normal tissues. Methotrexate and cyclosporine may prevent\n      this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of treatment with methotrexate and\n      cyclosporine after bone marrow transplantation to provide protection against acute\n      graft-versus-host disease."

Determine the efficacy of a combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine,\n      administered after grafting, to prevent the development of acute graft versus host disease\n      (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1,3,6, and 11. Patients also receive\n      cyclosporine IV twice a day until the patient is eating, then it is administered orally\n      twice a day. Cyclosporine begins on day -1 and continues until day 180. The dose is reduced\n      beginning on day 50.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Accrual will continue until further notice."
