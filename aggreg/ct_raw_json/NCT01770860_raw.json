Four of the wounds will be covered by different bandages and one will be left\n      uncovered.  Participants will visit the clinic every day for 2 weeks or until all the wounds\n      are healed (whichever comes first).  At the clinic, the bandages will be removed, the doctor\n      will score the wounds, a picture will be taken of the wounds, and new bandages will be\n      applied.\n\n      It is expected that some pain and itching will be experienced, because they are part of the\n      normal wound healing process.  Subjects will be asked about adverse events at each visit and\n      will have the opportunity to discuss issues or concerns with the investigator or the doctor\n      during the course of the trial.  It is expected that the wounds will be completely healed\n      within 14 days, but if not, the participant will need to return to the clinic for follow-up\n      treatment until the wounds are completely healed.\n\n      We will see if the different bandages help with the healing of the wounds during the study."
