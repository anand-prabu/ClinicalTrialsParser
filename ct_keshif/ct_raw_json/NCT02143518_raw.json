In vertebrate DNA CpG motifs are also usually methylated. Bacterial CpG-DNA motifs are recognized by the human innate immune system via Toll-like Receptor-9 (TLR-9), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptor that is expressed, in particular, by antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Interactions between CpG-DNA and TLR9 rapidly activate antigen-presenting dendritic cells to upregulate co-stimulatory molecules and to produce Th1-polarizing cytokines such as interleukin-12 and interferon gamma. CpG 10104 is a short synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide of the following sequence: 5'-TCG TCG TTT CGT CGT TTT GTC GTT-3'.",
