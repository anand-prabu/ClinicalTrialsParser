    <textblock>
      The phase 3 Trial 31-12-291 is part of the aripiprazole IM depot clinical development
      program and has been designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole IM
      depot for the treatment of adults experiencing an acute relapse of schizophrenia. Subjects
      receive treatment during a 12-week double-blind acute treatment phase. The current trial
      (31-12-297) will allow the subjects who complete Trial 291 to enter this open label trial at
      the investigator's discretion, where additional safety and tolerability data will be
      collected.

             reliably rated on assessment scales.

             for the acute treatment of adults with schizophrenia

          -  Subjects who, in the investigator's judgment, require chronic treatment with
             antipsychotic medication and would benefit from extended treatment with an IM depot
             formulation.

          -  Outpatient status at the Week 12 in Trial 291, with the exception of those subjects
             eligible to enter Trial 297 due to a positive interim analysis.

          -  Sexually active males of childbearing potential who do not agree to practice 2
             different methods of birth control or remain abstinent during the trial and for 180
             days after the last dose of trial medication. Sexually active Women of Childbearing
             Potential who do not agree to practice 2 different methods of birth control or remain

             serious risk of suicide.

          -  Subjects requiring any antipsychotic(s) other than aripiprazole IM depot after
             completion of Trial 291.

          -  Subjects likely to require prohibited concomitant therapy during the trial

          -  Laboratory test and ECG results which are exclusionary
