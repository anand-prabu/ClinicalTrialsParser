  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how  budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate
      (Symbicort Â©) affects dynamic hyperinflation in patients with obstructive disease using
      Optoelectronic Plethysmography (OEP). This study is unique as it will be the first
      randomized, doubleblind, crossover study with a placebo inhaler and budesonide/formoterol
      fumarate dihydrate as the intervention which will evaluate the effects on ventilatory
      mechanics through the use of OEP. The investigators plan to demonstrate that
      budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate impacts dynamic hyperinflation which can be
      detected with OEP, and that budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate may have an effect in
      the short term on exercise capacity during a constant load exercise test. The changes in
      ventilatory mechanics measured after budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate by OEP will
      provide a unique evaluation of budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate in a controlled
      setting also demonstrating the utility of OEP in evaluating of the effects of a medical
      treatment on hyperinflation in individuals with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD).

        1. Primary Objective/Hypothesis: Our objective is to measure baseline, post treatment and
           post exercise spirometry and evaluate exercise dynamic hyperinflation before and after
           treatment using OEP. The investigators hypothesize that budesonide/formoterol fumarate
           dihydrate will decrease dynamic hyperinflation as measured by OEP.

        2. Primary Endpoint: Our primary endpoint is the change in dynamic hyperinflation,
           specifically end expiratory volumes, dynamic lung volumes and diaphragmatic paradoxical
           breathing as measured by OEP.

        3. Secondary Objective: Our secondary objective is to evaluate duration of steady state
           exercise and exercise capacity before and after treatment. Our secondary hypothesis is
           that decreases in dynamic hyperinflation during exercise will lead to improvements in
           dyspnea with exercise, and allow for increases in exercise capacity.

        4. Secondary endpoint: Exercise time, change in Borg scale at rest vs. Borg scale at
           steady state vs. Borg at end exercise.

      This study will be a prospective, randomized, double blind, crossover interventional design.
      The crossover allows for equality in number of subjects assigned to each treatment and for
      subjects to be their own controls. Baseline spirometry will be taken prior to exercise test.
      Subjects will be prepared for OEP. All exercise will take place on an electromagnetically
      braked cycle ergometer. Throughout the protocol heart rate, blood pressure, O2 saturation,
      ventilation, and metabolic data will be recorded. A modified exercise induced asthma
      protocol will be used. Unlike prior studies, ventilatory kinematics (with isolated
      diaphragmatic function) will be monitored throughout exercise using biomechanical motion
      analysis (OEP). This OEP analysis involves compartmentalization of the chest into three
      sections; 1) pulmonary rib cage, 2) diaphragmatic rib cage, and 3) abdomen to determine the
      contribution of each component to total lung volume. By measuring the percent contribution
      of compartment, we are able to better understand its impact on respiration. OEP will be able
      to quantify and assess the distortion effects of dynamic hyperinflation and obstruction.

      Twenty moderate to severe COPD patients will be recruited. Subjects will refrain from their
      usual inhaled medications for 24 hours prior to the testing session. All subjects will be
      asked to verify that this is acceptable with their pulmonologist prior to participation.
      Subjects will also be asked to have their short acting bronchodilators and other regular
      medications available to be taken if symptoms should occur. During the initial screening,
      subjects will be familiarized with all procedures. Then baseline pulmonary function testing,
      and baseline resting OEP measurements will be performed. The subjects will then be
      randomized to receive either budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate or a placebo. At that
      time, they will receive treatment with either placebo or budesonide/formoterol fumarate
      dihydrate and after 45 minutes, they will repeat spirometry and OEP and submaximal exercise
      testing with OEP. After one week, subjects will be tested again and switched to the opposite
      treatment (i.e. if on budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate initially then switch to
      placebo and vice versa). The one week washout period between tests will include a resumption
      of the usual medications. The subjects will refrain from their inhaled medications for 24
      hours before the second testing session, but use all of their other usual medications.
