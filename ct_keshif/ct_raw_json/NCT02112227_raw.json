            "textblock": "Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause of hospitalization in older adults. The month\n      after hospital discharge represents a vulnerable period, when patients are at increased risk\n      of death and readmission to hospital. Research has shown that certain discharge-planning\n      services can reduce death and readmissions, but these have not been widely implemented. In\n      this study, we will group evidence-informed discharge-planning services into\n      'Patient-centered Care Transitions in HF' (PACT-HF), a model of care that will prepare\n      patients for their transition from hospital to home. Through PACT-HF, patients will benefit\n      from a comprehensive assessment of their health care needs, learn to recognize and manage\n      symptoms of HF, and receive the information and follow-up care needed to optimize their\n      health. We will introduce PACT-HF to 16 Ontario hospitals over a number of time periods. We\n      will compare the outcomes of patients in hospitals with PACT-HF to those in hospitals\n      without PACT-HF. We anticipate that patients hospitalized at the sites with PACT-HF will\n      have fewer readmissions, emergency visits, and deaths after discharge; report a better\n      quality of life; and feel more prepared for discharge. We also anticipate that overall,\n      PACT-HF will reduce health system costs."
