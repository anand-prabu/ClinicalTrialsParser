The study is designed as a two-arm\n      prospectively controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the study\n      or control catheter using a 1:1 schema.\n\n      Enrollment:\n\n      Four hundred sixteen (416) patients will be enrolled at four (4) to eight (8) study sites in\n      order to obtain 354 evaluable patients.\n\n      Study Objectives:\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the incidence of catheter-related\n      venous thrombosis in patients receiving either the 5 Fr BioFlo\u2122 PICC catheter or the control\n      catheter, i.e., the 5 Fr Dual-Lumen PowerPICC SOLO2\u00ae catheter.\n\n      Secondary objectives of this study are to investigate:\n\n        -  Incidence of other catheter-related complications, inclusive of catheter occlusion,\n           catheter-related infection, technical failures, and premature catheter removals\n\n        -  Incidence of catheter occlusion (independently from other catheter-related\n           complications)\n\n      Additionally, economic outcomes with respect to medical resource utilization requirements\n      will be compared between the two catheter groups (at US sites only)."
