            "textblock": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and the development\n      of cardiovascular disease. It is unclear how OSA results in endothelial dysfunction, but\n      given the association between OSA and obesity, adipose-derived hormones (adipokines) are\n      likely to be involved. Leptin, an adipokine upregulated in patients with OSA, has been shown\n      to be associated with deleterious effects on vascular function resulting in impaired\n      endothelial function. This proposal is directed at investigating the molecular mechanisms of\n      endothelial dysfunction in OSA patients.  We hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction\n      associated with OSA is a result of molecular alterations within endothelial cells. As a part\n      of these studies we will look at NO signaling pathways in adipose tissue and microvessels\n      from normal and OSA subjects."

The right brachial artery, proximal to the antecubital fossa, will be imaged longitudinally using a linear-array transducer. Flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation will be assessed by measuring the brachial artery diameter at baseline and during reactive hyperemia. Reactive hyperemia will be induced by deflating a cuff previously inflated to 200 mmHg for 5 minutes in the forearm. Variables will be measured for three consecutive cardiac cycles and the average will be taken.",
