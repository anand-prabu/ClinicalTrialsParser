  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with heart attacks, the treatment of choice is to restore blood flow with
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (use of stents (metal meshes) to open blockages).
      After PCI, the standard drug treatment includes aspirin and clopidogrel.  These medications
      block full function of the platelet cells, which are responsible for clotting.  Despite
      their use, patients after PCI are at risk for heart attacks, sudden clotting of stents or
      death.  A major contributor may be resistance to clopidogrel.  New more potent drugs, which
      can overcome the resistance, are now available; however, they come with an increase chance
      of severe bleeding and costs.  An ideal solution would be to identify at-risk patients and
      selectively treat them with more potent drugs, while lower-risk patients continue with
      clopidogrel.  This type of strategy (personalized strategy) would decrease heart attacks and
      death (compared to clopidogrel), while also preventing bleeding complications (compared to
      treating all patients with the new drugs).

      Of resistant patients, many carry genes (inherited units) that prevent proper absorption of
      clopidogrel.   Our group has developed and tested a new bedside genetic test, which
      identifies carriers of at-risk genes.  However, this technique alone does not identify all
      at-risk patients.  Consequently, we have now devised a novel tool, which combines genetics
      with patient characteristics to identify high-risk patients.

      The present study combines this new tool into a strategy for personalized treatment.
      Patients with heart attacks who undergo PCI will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 strategies:
      a) new personalized strategy, b) clopidogrel strategy (previous standard drug) or c)
      ticagrelor strategy (stronger approved drug).  The function of the platelet cells will be
      measured at 1 month to determine potential benefits.  Evaluation of this new personalized
      strategy is important for improving patient outcomes after PCI.   The hypothesis is that
      patients receiving a personalized strategy will have decrease risk for future heart attacks
      and bleeding.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients outside of the &quot;therapeutic window&quot; in the personalized therapy (PN) arm compared to the ticagrelor (TG) arm at 1 month.  The &quot;therapeutic window&quot; will be defined by platelet function values (VerifyNow P2Y12 assay - P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) ≤ 208 (correlated with decreased ischemic outcomes) AND % platelet inhibition ≤ 90% (correlated with decrease bleeding).
