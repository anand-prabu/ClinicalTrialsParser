Subjects will be assigned to D-serine (60mg/kg) or placebo to be taken 1x\n      each week during the SBR sessions.  Subjects will receive study drug 30 minutes prior to\n      session.\n\n      Subjects will under go three sessions of tone matching SBR, followed by 3 sessions  of\n      emotion recognition SBR.  In total subjects will have 6 treatment sessions, and as before,\n      treatment days will be separated by 1 week. Electrophysiology will be conducted at baseline\n      and after the third weekly SBR session, and  social cognitive and safety measures will also\n      be completed at baseline and final.\n\n      Double blind SBR intervention: First three sessions will be similar to SBR for pilot, with\n      base tones limited to 100-400 Hz (emotionally relevant range). This will be followed by\n      three sessions in which subjects are trained on identifying emotionally relevant tones.\n      Tones will be developed based on previous research (Kantrowitz 2011).\n\n      Kantrowitz JT, Leitman DI, Lehrfeld JM, Laukka P, Juslin PN, Butler PD, et al.

All\n             women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the\n             baseline visit.  We require an IQ of \u226585 to ensure that subjects will have a capacity\n             to learn.  In our cross-sectional studies, we have observed an IQ\u226585 in over 90% of\n             candidates, suggesting that this is not an overly restrictive criterion."
