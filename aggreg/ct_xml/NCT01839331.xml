      A Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of
      two Doses of Intra-Articular Injection of Ampion™ in Adults with pain due to osteoarthritis
      of the knee.

      The primary trial objective is to evaluate the greater efficacy of 10 mL Ampion™ versus 10
      mL placebo than 4 mL Ampion™ versus 4 mL placebo intra-articular (IA) injection in improving
      knee pain, when applied to patients suffering from OA of the knee.

      The secondary trial objective include: the evaluation of the safety of an intra-articular
      injection of Ampion™ when applied to patients suffering from OA of the knee, evaluation of
      the efficacy of intra-articular injection of Ampion™ and placebo on stiffness and function
      when applied to patients suffering from OA of the knee and evaluation of responder status
      defined by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials and Osteoarthritis Research
      Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) Criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study

             study staff

          -  Male or female, 40 years to 85 years old (inclusive)

          -  Must be ambulatory

          -  Index knee must be symptomatic for greater than 6 months with a clinical diagnosis of
             OA and supported by radiological evidence Kellgren Lawrence Grade II to IV) that is
             not older than 6 months prior to the date of screening

          -  Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the index knee (rating of at least 1.5 on
             the WOMAC Index 3.1 5-point Likert Pain Subscale) assessed at screening

          -  Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the index knee (even if chronic doses of
             nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which have not changed in the 4 weeks
             prior to screening, have been/are being used)
