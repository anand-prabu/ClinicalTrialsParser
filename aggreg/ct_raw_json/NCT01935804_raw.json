            "textblock": "Women with T2DM exhibit normal or higher bone mineral density (BMD) for their age, but with\n      approximately twice the overall risk of bone fragility compared with nondiabetic subjects.\n      Known the apparent association between T2DM and the risk of bone fragility, examining the\n      effects of commonly used oral antidiabetic agents; such as MET and thiazolidinediones (TZDs;\n      for example rosiglitazone [ROS] or PIO), on BMD and/or bone turnover is of great clinical\n      relevance for both diabetic patients and their treating physicians.  Recent clinical trials,\n      showed that women treated with ROS had higher risk of bone fragility and self-reported\n      adverse events.  Similarly, women on long-term treatment with PIO for T2DM experienced\n      higher incidence of distal extremity fractures. TZDs are agonists of the nuclear\n      transcription factor peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) which increase\n      insulin sensitivity and improve glycemic control in T2DM.  PPAR (\u03b3) acts also as a molecular\n      factor that favours adipogenesis over osteoblastogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells.  The\n      latter was suggested as a potential mechanism for the effects of TZDs on bone among others.\n      In humans, TZDs decrease BMD and increase bone fragility risk.  This study tests whether\n      pioglitazone as compared to MET (both are commonly used in the treatment of T2DM in Saudi\n      Arabia and other countries) affects bone health including bone mineral density, bone\n      turnover markers, and osteocyte biomarker in patients with T2DM."
