  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our group previously conducted a study looking at the performance of three styles of
      positive airway pressure masks during laboratory treatment studies for obstructive sleep
      apnea, and we found that patients using a full-mask mask required higher positive airway
      pressures than patients using nasal or nasal pillows style masks to achieve successful
      reduction of respiratory events. In the current study we want to randomly assign patients to
      either nasal or full-face masks and then switch to a different mask (if nasal was originally
      chosen than the mask will be switched to full-face and vise versa) after 3-weeks of use to
      see if the number of respiratory events change with the different mask style. We expect the
      number of respiratory events will increase with the use of full-face masks.
