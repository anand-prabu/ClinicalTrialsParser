    <textblock>
      Moderate exercise is recommended to improve cardiovascular health in obese and overweight
      people particularly with metabolic syndrome (MetS) that have hypertension, elevated fasting
      blood sugar, and elevated blood lipids.  This study is being done to determine how platelets
      respond when a person performs an initial period of moderate exercise.

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention (24 hours), &amp; time points during the exercise phase: prior to exercise (-25 min, -10 min, - 1 min), 10 minutes into the routine, at completion (25 minutes), and 20 &amp; 60 minutes following completion</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that moderate physical exercise will increase platelet reactivity in sedentary individuals with metabolic syndrome. Platelet reactivity will be measured by flow cytometry using anti-CD61 antibodies as a marker for platelets and anti-CD62 (P-selectin) as a marker of platelet activation. This will be measured at baseline, post-intervention and time points post-baseline in each subject.</description>

    <description>This intervention is comprised of two separate visits at least one week apart.  The purpose of visit 1 is to determine the cycle ergometer workload that produces a moderate exercise intensity of 60% heart rate reserve to be used on visit 2. The purpose of visit 2 is to determine changes in platelet reactivity in response to moderate exercise.</description>
