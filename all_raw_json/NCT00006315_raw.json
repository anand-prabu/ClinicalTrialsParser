            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Exercise is a key component of behavioral weight loss programs because of its effect on\n      weight loss, body composition, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and other obesity\n      related diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite these benefits, it is unclear\n      whether there is an optimal exercise duration and/or intensity that will enhance long-term\n      weight loss. The current public health recommendation for physical activity is for\n      individuals to participate in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on\n      most days of the week (approximately 150 minutes per week total). However, it is unclear\n      whether this amount of exercise is adequate for long-term weight loss. Moreover,\n      cross-sectional studies have shown that individuals that have been successful at long-term\n      weight loss participate in levels of physical activity that are greater than the current\n      public health recommendations.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The researchers hypothesized that adopting higher levels of exercise duration and/or\n      intensity, coupled with a strong behavioral intervention would enhance long-term weight\n      loss. To test this hypothesis, they recruited 200 overweight women and randomly assigned\n      them to one of four treatment groups: (1)  moderate intensity, moderate 1000cal/wk duration\n      exercise, (2) vigorous intensity moderate duration exercise, (3) moderate 2000cal/wk\n      intensity, high duration exercise, and (4) vigorous intensity, high duration exercise. All\n      subjects participated in a 24-month behavioral weight loss program, with subjects attending\n      group meetings and receiving periodic telephone contacts from the weight loss program, with\n      subjects attending group meetings and  receiving periodic telephone contacts from the\n      interventionists. In addition,  to facilitate the adoption of the exercise protocols, all\n      subjects were provided with a home treadmill. Assessment of body weight occured at 0, 6, 12,\n      and 24 months and exercise participation was measured throughout the program. In addition,\n      body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and\n      mediators of behavior change were measured at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months."
