In Part 2, patients\n      are treated with fluvoxamine (FVX) for 8 weeks. If patients do not respond to FVX alone,\n      either haloperidol or an inactive placebo will be added to the FVX regimen; patients will\n      take this drug combination for 4 weeks. Patients will be monitored throughout the trial."

The validity of TS-spectrum OCD as a distinct subtype is assessed\n      using a detailed clinical, family, drug treatment response profile in adult OCD patients.\n\n      In Study I, patients are divided prospectively into 2 putative subtypes (TS-spectrum and\n      non-TS-spectrum OCD) on the basis of clinical history and direct, structured interviews of\n      family members (approximately 400 interviews).\n\n      In Study II, patients enter an 8-week single-blind trial with the potent and selective 5-HT\n      reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FX).  Patients with an incomplete response to FX alone\n      (approximately 64 patients) are randomized to a 4-week double-blind trial of FX in\n      combination with the dopamine (DA) 2 antagonist olanzapine (OLA) or placebo (PLA)."
