Optimal metabolic control, especially early\n      intensive glycemic control, plays a role in the prevention of progressive \u00df-cell dysfunction\n      and possibly destruction of the \u00df-cells with worsening of diabetes.\n\n      We have found that a 6-month course of insulin therapy after a short-term intensive insulin\n      therapy could shorten the period of hyperglycemia to preserve \u00df-cell function and further\n      improve long-term glycemic control in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe\n      hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dl, with HBA1C level around 9-11%) in our previous study.
