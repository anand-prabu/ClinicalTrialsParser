Induced pulmonary collapse by opening of the pleura and disconnection of\n      the patient from the ventilator during CPB decreases the amount of air that can enter the\n      pulmonary veins. Not all surgeons wish to induce lung collapse from fraught that it might\n      lead to pulmonary ischemia or infection. It is unknown whether collapse of only the right\n      lung is as effective as collapse of both lungs."
