            "textblock": "Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) causes substantial mortality, morbidity and poor quality of\n      life after blood or marrow transplantation (BMT). In Alberta, we use antithymocyte globulin\n      (ATG, given on days -2, -1 and 0) in addition to methotrexate and cyclosporine for GVHD\n      prophylaxis. In spite of that, ~40% patients develop significant GVHD (grade 2-4 acute GVHD\n      or chronic GVHD needing systemic immunosuppressive therapy). ATG at the dose we typically\n      use (4.5 mg/kg) is relatively non-toxic. At higher doses, ATG could increase the likelihood\n      of posttransplant infections or relapse. Thus an extra dose of ATG (on top of the routine\n      4.5 mg/kg) might be justified only for patients at high risk of developing significant GVHD.\n      In our experience, low serum level of interleukin-15 (IL15) and high serum level of\n      interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL2Ra) on day 7 predict development of significant GVHD. Here\n      we will test whether, compared to historical/concurrent controls, an extra dose of ATG (3\n      mg/kg on day 8) given to patients with low IL15 or high IL2Ra on day 7 reduces the incidence\n      of significant GVHD, and improves survival free of relapse and GVHD, and quality of life."

            "textblock": "Blood for IL15 and IL2Ra determination will be drawn in the morning of day 7 (10 ml red top\n      tube). IL15 and IL2Ra levels will be measured in Storek/Khan Lab by enzyme-linked\n      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described (Pratt LM et al: BMT 2013). Storek/Khan Lab staff\n      will report the IL15 and IL2Ra levels to the Bone Marrow Transplant ward (Unit 57, Foothills\n      Medical Centre) no later than in the morning of day 8. If the IL15 level is <31 ng/L or the\n      IL2Ra level is >4500 ng/L, the physician caring for the patient on the ward will order\n      Thymoglobulin, 3 mg/kg intravenously, to be infused over 4-8 hours on day 8. The dose is\n      based on actual body weight, and is rounded to the nearest vial (Thymoglobulin is supplied\n      in 25 mg vials) except if the rounding would result in >5% difference from the calculated\n      dose. Unit 57 standard practice will be followed for the infusion of ATG (see Standard\n      Operation Procedure BMTS40153 [\"ATG Administration\"]). Premedication for ATG will include\n      methylprednisolone 40 mg IVPB, acetaminophen 1000 mg PO and diphenhydramine 50 mg IVPB.\n      Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO and diphenhydramine 50 mg IVPB can be repeated in 4-6 hours PRN\n      flu-like symptoms/fever/chills. Meperidine 25-50 mg IVPB every 4 hours will be given PRN for\n      rigors.\n\n      EVALUATIONS For the endpoint of the incidence of significant GVHD, patients will be followed\n      per standard practice of the Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant Program for the development\n      of acute and chronic GVHD\n      (www.albertahealthservices.ca/hp/if-hp-cancer-guide-bmt-manual.pdf). Per this standard\n      practice, acute GVHD is graded according to Consensus criteria (Przepiorka D: BMT 1995) and\n      chronic GVHD is diagnosed and graded according to NIH criteria (Filipovich AH: BBMT 2005).\n      Significant GVHD is defined as grade 2-4 acute GVHD or chronic GVHD needing systemic\n      immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n      For the endpoint of survival free of significant GVHD and relapse, relapse will be defined\n      by standard criteria (eg, >5% marrow blasts by morphology in case of acute leukemia).\n\n      For the endpoint of quality of life at 2 years (21-27 months) posttransplant, Short Form 36\n      will be used."
