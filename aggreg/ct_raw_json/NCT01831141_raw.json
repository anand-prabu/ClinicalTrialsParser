            "textblock": "Congenital Solitary kidney (CSK) is a disorder caused by the abnormal development of one of\n      the two kidneys. This abnormality can be either anatomical, caused by unilateral renal\n      agenesis (RAG), or functional, caused by extreme forms of dysplasia (renal  aplasia-RAP and\n      multicystic dysplastic kidney disease-MCKD). The reported incidence is between 1:450-3200\n      with no difference between the two sexes. CSK is a subgroup of a large family of Congenital\n      Anomalies of the  Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT), which are caused by abnormal embryologic\n      development. Physiologically, the development of the kidney begins during the 3rd week of\n      gestation and proceeds through a series of phases:  the pronephros, mesonephros, and\n      metanephros. While abnormalities of the early pronephros-mesonephros phases lead to renal\n      agenesis, an aberrant metanephros phase can cause  a more wide spectrum of  CAKUT.  CAKUT\n      are the leading cause of chronic (50%) and end stage (40%) kidney disease in children. While\n      this risk is well known for some phenotypes (e.g. bilateral renal hypodysplasia and\n      posterior urethral valves), whether CSK is a benign condition or not, has been the subject\n      of recent debate. The knowledge of the natural history of CSK originates mainly from\n      retrospective studies often performed in tertiary medical centers which are difficult to\n      compare for several reasons: the number of individuals studied varied considerably as did\n      the underlying CSK disorders (RAG, MCKD or RAP), the length of follow-up and the type of\n      outcomes considered. These studies show an  extremely variable risk of developing\n      proteinuria (11-27%), hypertension (0-60%), and chronic kidneys disease (3.5-30%). So there\n      are many difficulties which prevent us from understanding: a) which phenotype (RAG, MCKD or\n      RAP) or risk factors could influence the progression to an adverse outcome; b) whether or\n      not the compensatory hypertrophy and resulting hyperfiltration acts as a protective\n      mechanism. Recently, Sanna-Cherchi et al. retrospectively analyzed the long-term renal\n      outcome of over 300 children with CAKUTs. With simple selection criteria, dialysis-free\n      survival from birth was modelled to account for concomitant vesicoureteral reflux, age at\n      diagnosis, hypertension, proteinuria, and serum creatinine concentration. Surprisingly the\n      analysis revealed that patients with solitary kidney have a probability of nearly 50 % of\n      requiring dialysis by 30 years of age.  This clinical outcome raises the possibility that\n      subclinical defects could be present in the congenital solitary kidney which may account for\n      a poorer prognosis. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the long-term\n      prognosis in individuals with acquired single kidney (e.g. transplant donors or subject\n      nephrectomized for Wilm's tumor) appears to be excellent.\n                                           This reported high risk of  poor outcome in CSK\n      patients has highlighted the need for understanding: 1) the rate and the factors determining\n      progression to end-stage renal disease; 2) the development of biomarkers to improve early\n      detection. Usually, children with CSK are not always subjected to long term follow-up and\n      when they are, monitoring involves plasma creatinine concentration , proteinuria and\n      ultrasonography.  Because most cases of endstage renal disease in children result from\n      tubulointerstitial rather than glomerular disorders, serum creatinine and urine protein\n      determinations are relatively insensitive. New biomarkers are now available that can\n      facilitate the early identification of changes in renal function before they become\n      irreversible. These biomarkers of glomerular (serum Cystatin C) or tubular damage (urine\n      alfa-1 and beta-2 microglobulin, urine lysozyme, serum and urine neutrophil gelatinase\n      associated lipocalin (NGAL), urine Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3),  urine Kidney injury molecule 1\n      (KIM1), urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), already validated for various kidney\n      diseases (acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, etc), could be useful in the early\n      identification of damage in CSK patients.\n\n      The aim of  this longitudinal study is to assess, in a cohort of children with CSK, during a\n      10-year follow-up period:\n\n        1. the rates of developing proteinuria, hypertension  and chronic kidney disease and\n           potential prognostic factors.\n\n        2. the role of new biomarkers of glomerular or tubular damage in predicting the appearance\n           of chronic kidney damage.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      Study group: male and female children, aged 0-18 years, diagnosed with CSK, documented by\n      renal ultrasonography and confirmed by dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) Scan.
