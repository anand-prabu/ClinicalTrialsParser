In past years, Guangxi has experienced a relatively\n      high rate of late HIV diagnoses, which has contributed to a significant proportion of\n      HIV-related deaths occurring in the same year of initial diagnosis. The study's proposed\n      mechanism of decreasing mortality rates is to shorten the time between initial HIV screening\n      and ART implementation to within two weeks.\n\n      Two pilot sites were selected based on past core assessment indicators. The study population\n      consists of participants who received an initial HIV infection diagnosis within the study\n      period. Medical institutions will provide \"one-stop services\" by following detailed\n      guidelines regarding reporting of positive HIV antibody screenings, further testing\n      procedures, and treatment referrals in accordance with a pre-determined timetable. In\n      addition, additional strategies focusing on policy development, medical personnel training,\n      and a broad general public education campaign will be implemented.\n\n      The study will be performed from July,2012 to July,2015. Main assessment measures are\n      HIV-related mortality rates, treatment coverage, or other health outcomes.\n\n        1. HIV-related mortality rates of participants who are newly diagnosed during the study\n           period Numerator: Number of all-cause deaths during the study period Denominator:\n           Number of HIV infected patients followed during the study period.\n\n        2.
