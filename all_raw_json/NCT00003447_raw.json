Determine the activity and toxicity of the combination of\n      gemcitabine and vinorelbine in these patients. III. Compare the survival rate and quality of\n      life of these patients treated with combination chemotherapy versus single agent\n      chemotherapy. IV. Compare objective response and time to progression of these patients\n      treated with these chemotherapy regimens. V. Compare the toxicities of these three regimens\n      in these patients. VI. Compare the number of hospitalizations, palliative radiation\n      therapies, antibiotic therapies, corticosteroid therapies, analgesic therapies, and\n      hematopoietic growth factor therapies needed for these patients treated with these\n      chemotherapy regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, stage\n      of disease (IIIB vs IV), and performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to\n      one of three treatment arms. Patients receive either vinorelbine IV, gemcitabine IV, or both\n      on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day course. Patients who achieve an objective response or stable\n      disease after 3 courses receive 3 more courses (for a total of 6 courses). Quality of life\n      is assessed before treatment, after course 4 (or 3 weeks after course 3, if therapy is\n      stopped), and at 21 days after course 6 (or 12 weeks after course 3).\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 630 patients (210 patients per arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
