Patients\n      achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional 8 months after\n      reaching CR. Treatment continues for at least 3 months in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 2 months during the first year and every 3 months during the\n      second year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued in this study."
