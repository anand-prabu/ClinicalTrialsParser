Although a large amount of data demonstrate the effectiveness of of BT\n      and CBT approaches for treating anxious youth, there is a gap in the literature for the\n      effectiveness of these approaches for children under the age of seven.  Evidence\n      increasingly suggests that family factors such as accommodation and parenting style\n      contribute significantly to the presence of anxiety symptoms as well as treatment outcomes,\n      particularly in young children.  These findings stress the importance of using a treatment\n      approach in which parents are directly involved in education, parent training, and\n      generalization of treatment effects. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate a new treatment\n      program, parent-led behavioral treatment, for children ages 3 to 7 years of age  who have a\n      principal anxiety disorder diagnosis."
