The information\n      collected under this exploratory study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, assessments\n      of the participant's response to therapy or for clinical management of the participants.\n      However, this exploratory study will provide baseline information on the safety,\n      biodistribution, and dosimetry of [F-18]T808. These data will aid in the design of future\n      studies of [F-18]T808 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Overall, this study will provide\n      initial data that inform the development of [F-18]T808 as the first PET imaging agent for\n      human tau protein related pathology."
