Bone marrow and peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow\n      doctors to give high doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with\n      cyclophosphamide, etoposide and cisplatin followed by bone marrow and/or peripheral stem\n      cell transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory intermediate- or high-grade\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Syngeneic bone marrow transplantation is preferred for patients with a\n      qualifying identical twin donor. Patients without a syngeneic donor who have a history of\n      lymphomatous involvement of the bone marrow and are profoundly hypocellular undergo harvest\n      of PBSC alone. Patients without a syngeneic donor who have no history of lymphomatous\n      involvement of the bone marrow undergo harvest of autologous bone marrow or PBSC.\n\n      Patients receive conditioning comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3\n      and etoposide IV over 1 hour every 12 hours and cisplatin IV continuously on days -6 to -4.\n      Bone marrow and/or PBSC are infused on day 0. (Patients requiring more than 25 bags of stem\n      cells receive bone marrow transplantation on day 0 and PBSC transplantation on day 1.)\n\n      After recovery from transplantation, eligible patients receive consolidative radiotherapy to\n      any site of prior bulk disease (greater than 5 cm) present at any time before\n      transplantation and any site of disease present at the time of transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
