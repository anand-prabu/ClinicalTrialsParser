            "textblock": "Given the potential of semi-quantitative pregnancy tests as part of assisted fertility care,\n      we would like to document the feasibility and acceptability of a semi-quantitative pregnancy\n      test as an adjunct to or replacement of current monitoring protocols to offer women and\n      health care providers a new choice of diagnostic tools to confirm early pregnancy.  The\n      pilot will help us to better understand how this tool complements existing monitoring\n      protocols.  If a suitable addition, replacement to repeat blood draws for serum hCG\n      assessment, the SQPT could also contribute to efforts to make assisted fertility treatments\n      more patient-friendly.  This study seeks to test this innovation by asking women assigned to\n      perform a dBest\u00ae semi-quantitative urine panel test (AmeriTekInc, Seattle WA, USA)at home on\n      a weekly basis for up to 4 weeks after embryo transfer.\n\n      We hypothesize that the test, which can be used at home by women, will provide confirmation\n      of the presence of a pregnancy compared with standard serum hCG testing because 1) it has\n      sensitivity and specificity that correlates well with serum testing, and 2) it can be used\n      at home and thus earlier to determine presence of hCG. Furthermore, a pregnancy can be\n      assured only when a yolksac or embryo could be identified thus women have to wait for a\n      period of 2-3 weeks after the next menses expected.\n\n      We hypothesize that women seeking assisted fertility treatments will be able to monitor\n      their hCG at home as well.  Further, we plan to develop revised instructions to better suit\n      the needs and questions we think would be relevant to women desiring to use this test as\n      part of assisted fertility services.\n\n      We hypothesize that the simple instructions we will develop for use in this study will\n      enable women to use the test on their own. Provider counseling will complement these\n      instructions and contribute to overall quality of care given to each participant."
