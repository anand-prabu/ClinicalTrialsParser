One of the surgical procedures is Intrastromal Corneal Ring implantations that\n      have been designed to achieve refractive readjustment by flattening the cornea. There are\n      different models of Intrastromal Corneal rings available: intrastromal corneal ring segments\n      (ICRS) such as Keraring and intrastromal corneal continuous ring (ICCR) like Myoring.\n\n      Most studies of these two types of ring implantation outcomes are retrospective case series.\n      Thus, this Randomized Clinical Trial study was designed with the aim of Comparing visual and\n      refractive outcomes and complications of insertion Myoring versus Keraring using Femtosecond\n      laser. Keratoconus patients with compound myopic astigmatism who meet the inclusion criteria\n      will randomly allocated to the Keraring and Myoring groups. Subsequently, the clinical\n      outcomes of two groups will be compared at one,3 and 6  months after surgery."
