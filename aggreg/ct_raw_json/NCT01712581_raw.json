            "textblock": "Cardiac MRI is more and more used in patients with  ischaemic and non-ischaemic heart\n      diseases. One major strength of MRI is its great potential for tissue characterization.\n\n      For early detection and follow-up of patients with hemosiderosis, who are at high risk of\n      myocardial iron overload, cardiac MRI seems to be the most reliable, more reproducible and\n      less invasive method. In addition MRI does not require injection of contrast media. It is\n      commonly accepted that myocardial T2 * value of less than 20 ms corresponds to iron overload\n      in the myocardium. However, this value is based on a small sample study and nomogram based\n      on age were not published. The determination of normal values in a population of healthy\n      controls according to age appears to be a prerequisite for reliable interpretation of\n      imaging data.\n\n      Moreover, myocardial edema and fibrosis are more and more evaluated with cardiac MRI using\n      T1 and T2 myocardial relaxation times. As for T2* values, normogram of T1 and T2 values\n      based on age were not published.\n\n      The increasing use of T1, T2 and T2* mapping sequences in clinical practice for tissue\n      characterization of the myocardium justify the implementation of a study in healthy\n      volunteers to determine normograms based on age."
