All suitable patients will receive 3 cycles of melphalan and lenograstim alternately.\nPatient will start with a 3 day lenograstim (at 10mcg/kg/day) to boost up the blood cell count.\nUpon reaching sufficient blood cell count, patients will undergo a venesection and roughly a pint of blood is taken. After this patients will receive first cycle of Melphalan (60mg/m2). The following day patient will receive back the previously given whole blood. A treament break of 6 days between the cycles is given. After the break the patient will be given Lenograstim (10mcg/kg/day)for 6 days (until sufficient).\nThe above regimen is repeated for cycle 2 and cycle 3 with only exception of Melphalan is given at 40mg/m2. After the cycle 3, Lenograstrim is given at 263 mcg/day for 10 days.\nUpon treatment completion, patients will be followed for 2 years. If the patients show disease progression, they will start hormone therapy."

            "textblock": "The management of (castration-resistant) prostate cancer (CRPC) is becoming increasingly\n      complex.  The use of peripheral anti-androgens with gonadorelin analogues (maximum androgen\n      blockade) is common place. Following the failure of such an approach, several strategies may\n      be employed.  Both corticosteroids and estrogens have a role and increasingly chemotherapy\n      is being used.  The demonstration of enhanced survival using 3 weekly docetaxel has meant\n      that this is viewed by many as the standard of care for fit patients.\n\n      Melphalan is an established alkylating drug that has demonstrated some activity in CRPC, but\n      to date, myelosuppression has prevented adequate dosing. We have recently conducted a phase\n      I dose escalation study using melphalan and whole blood stem cell re-infusion and it shows\n      that median overall survival is 22 months, which is higher than the median survival rate of\n      19 months for Docetaxel\n\n      Data from a previous phase I study has proved the successful administration of higher doses\n      of IV Melphalan in combination with autologous blood infusion in patients with\n      Castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\n      Rapid falls in circulating tumour cells were seen within 2 weeks of starting Melphalan,\n      however slow platelet recovery meant longer periods of platelet transfusion.  For this study\n      we intend to assess the efficacy of an intensified intravenous melphalan with autologous\n      whole blood stem cell transplantation over three treatment cycles.\n\n      39 patients will be enrolled over a 3 year period and at least 17 patients need to survive\n      progression free at least 6-months for this study to be considered positive.\n\n      Mel-CAP is a combination chemotherapy consisting of two chemotherapy drugs:\n\n      MELPHALAN and LENOGRASTIM for 3 cycles alternately."
