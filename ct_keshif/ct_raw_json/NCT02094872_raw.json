Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other\n      substances to identify and attack specific types of cancer cells with less harm to normal\n      cells. Molecularly targeted therapy works by treating patients with substances that kill\n      cancer cells by targeting key molecules involved in cancer cell growth."
