  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth loss and sleep problems are common conditions in elders. Tooth loss can influence
      sleep quality by changing the shape of the lower face and upper airway. While some studies
      suggest that sleeping without dentures can worsen sleep quality in toothless elders, others
      suggest the opposite. Consequently, there are currently no evidence-based practice
      guidelines regarding whether dentures should be used at night, and dentists and doctors do
      not know how to properly advise their patients on these issues. To address this knowledge
      gap, over the past 5 years we have carried out research examining the quality of sleep of a
      group of edentulous elders. In addition, we conducted a pilot study to examine the link
      between night-time denture wear and sleep. Our results indicate that edentulous elders who
      wore their dentures at night had high levels of daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, use of
      dentures at night seemed to increase the risk of apneic events in those elders who had mild
      sleep disturbance. While intriguing, these results require confirmation in larger samples.
      In line with our previous research, the aim of the proposed study is to produce reliable
      evidence that clinical practice guidelines could be based on and which could be used by
      dentists and doctors who treat toothless elders.

      We will enroll 56 toothless elders who will be randomly assigned to wear and not wear their
      dentures at night for two periods of 15 days. Sleep studies will be conducted at the homes
      of participants. The participants will also be asked to respond to questions on sleep
      quality and oral health-related quality of life. Ultimately, the results of this study will
      help improve the health and quality of life of millions of elders in Canada and around the
      world.

      BACKGROUND

      Aging substantially increases the risk of edentulism and sleep disturbance. These two
      chronic conditions have serious adverse consequences for the functioning and quality of life
      of elders and place a significant burden on the Canadian health care system. Edentulism can
      disturb sleep through the alteration of the craniofacial structure and surrounding soft
      tissue. However, the effect of prosthetic rehabilitation of edentulism on sleep quality is
      still not well understood. While there is some evidence suggesting that not wearing dentures
      at night can worsen sleep quality and lead to severe sleep disturbance in edentate elders,
      there are also studies that have suggested the opposite. The current controversy does not
      permit clinicians to engage in evidence-based clinical decision-making. To enable
      development of clinical practice guidelines, solid evidence is required. This proposed
      randomized trial represents the logical next step of the clinical investigations conducted
      by our multidisciplinary expert team of oral health and sleep researchers from the
      University of Montreal, McGill University, University of British Colombia, and Laval
      University. Our pilot data suggest that edentate elders who wear dentures at night
      experience more daytime sleepiness than those who do not. Furthermore, we found that the
      nocturnal use of dentures may increase the risk of apneic events in seniors affected by mild
      sleep disturbance.

      OBJECTIVES

      The primary objective of this study is to test whether nocturnal denture wear affects sleep
      quality and daytime sleepiness of edentate elders. Our secondary objective is to test
      whether nocturnal denture wear affects the oral-health-related quality of life of edentate
      elders. The third objective is to identify moderators of effect of nocturnal denture wear so
      as to identify patient subgroups where the intervention is more efficacious.

      METHODS

      We will carry out a single-blind randomized cross-over clinical trial, into which 56
      edentate elders will be enrolled. Study participants will be assigned to wear and not wear
      their denture in alternate orders for two periods of 15 days. The primary outcome will be
      sleep quality (as measured by the apnea-hypopnea index). The secondary outcomes will be
      daytime sleepiness and oral health-related quality of life. Outcome assessments will be
      carried out with portable polysomnography, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and an oral
      health-related quality of life questionnaire. Explanatory variables will include
      socio-demographic factors, oropharyngeal morphology, oral and prosthesis characteristics, as
      well as perceived general health quality of life. These characteristics will be assessed by
      clinical examination, 3D imaging (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) of the cranio-facial
      structure, as well as validated questionnaires. Assessments will be done at baseline and at
      the end of each of the 15-day intervention periods. Linear mixed-effects regression models
      for repeated measures will be fitted to test the study hypotheses. The main analyses will be
      based on the intention-to-treat principle. To assess the robustness of the findings to
      potential incomplete adherence, sensitivity analyses will be conducted while applying the
      per-protocol principle.

      SIGNIFICANCE

      Our findings will have important clinical implications and will help to resolve the current
      uncertainty about the effects of nocturnal wearing of dentures in the edentate elderly
      population. This practice-relevant evidence could enable the development of preventive
      approaches to improve sleep quality of the older population and, thereby, improve their
      well-being and quality of life. This evidence will be shared with the Canadian Dental
      Association, the Canadian and the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine, and the
      Canadian Sleep Society to assist these agencies in producing practice guidelines for primary
      care providers, dentists, and sleep medicine specialists involved in the care of edentate
      elders.
