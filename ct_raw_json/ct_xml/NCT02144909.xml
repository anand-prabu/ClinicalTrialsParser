  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a feasibility study using a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) design in which participants will receive the Partners in Care (PIC) diabetes
      self-management intervention and then be randomized to either semi-structured social support
      or a standard follow-up control group. Participants in the support groups will receive a
      culturally-tailored, semi-structured social support program delivered in a community setting
      by trained community peer educators and other health professionals (e.g., pharmacist). The
      investigators believe that the addition of a semi-structured social support component as a
      supplement to an evidence-based diabetes self-management intervention will improve diabetes
      self-care maintenance.
