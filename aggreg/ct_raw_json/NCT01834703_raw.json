HIFU is a medical technology that has been used for cancer treatment.  Energy is\n      delivered from outside the body in a non-invasive manner to produce heat energy that causes\n      necrosis and shrinkage of the uterine fibroid thereby relieves the symptoms due to the\n      fibroid.  It does not involve radiation.  The clinical effectiveness of HIFU for uterine\n      fibroid is unknown, however, based on the knowledge of the clinical effectiveness of HIFU on\n      liver cancer and pancreatic cancer, there is reasonable ground to believe that HIFU is\n      effective for uterine fibroid."
