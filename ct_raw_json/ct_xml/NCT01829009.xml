  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of multiple physical and cognitive abilities.
      From these changes, the most important one is the loss of muscle mass, which has been called
      &quot;sarcopenia&quot;. Resistance exercise is a therapeutic approach for sarcopenia, nevertheless
      there is no universal consensus. Therefore, this research is interested in determining the
      effect of a resistance exercise program on physical performance and/or functional status in
      sarcopenic older women. The main study hypothesis is that a program of resistance exercise
      will improve physical performance and functional status in sarcopenic older women compared
      against general recommendations.

      This is a single-blind, controlled clinical trial, including women&gt; 70 years, living in the
      community with sarcopenia. Those who agree to participate, will be randomly assigned to one
      of the following groups:

        1. Resistance Exercise Group

        2. General Recommendations Group (control) The study will last 24 weeks, with 4
           measurements performed at baseline, week 6, 12 and 24. Multilevel models (random
           effects) will be constructed for the comparison between the two groups. Tests will be
           conducted with a P=0.05 and confidence intervals at 95%. This protocol has been
           approved by the local ethics committee.

    <description>General information about sarcopenia will be provided to the participants, as well as general recommendations of healthy habits. We will contact the participants weekly by phone to answer questions about sarcopenia, and remind them of their next appointment and about adverse events occured during this period of time. The frequent contact with the participants has also the purpose to prevent losses or rejections for future evaluations</description>

    <description>An individualized resistance exercise program wil be applied twice a week by an expert physiotherapist. Every 2 weeks, intensity will be reassessed by the same physiotherapist. Weekly, participants will be asked about incidents such as the occurrence of falls or hospitalizations during this study period.
Physical performance and functional status will be assessed by the blind investigator at weeks 6,12 and 24</description>
