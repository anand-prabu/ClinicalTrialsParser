Patients are stratified according to disease subtype.\n\n      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily. Treatment continues for 1 year in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-120 patients (6-12 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
