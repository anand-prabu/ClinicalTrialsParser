  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic condition. Even with proper treatment, no
      significant improvement is reached in about 30% to 40% of patients. Thus, the development of
      new treatment strategies is necessary. The attentional bias - ability to aversive stimuli in
      capturing the attention of an individual compared to a neutral stimulus - has been
      extensively studied. Already training attentional bias modification has been shown effective
      in reducing anxiety present in other anxiety disorders.This project aims to: 1 - generate
      knowledge on attentional bias in individuals with OCD through the use of a standardized
      protocol developed for OCD; 2 - available to the scientific community the first specific
      paradigm for the study of attentional bias in OCD patients, 3 - test the effectiveness of a
      training protocol for reversing attentional bias in individuals with OCD.
