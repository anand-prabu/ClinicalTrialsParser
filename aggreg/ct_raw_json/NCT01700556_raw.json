            "textblock": "The World Alzheimer Report indicates that, worldwide, there were 35.6 million people with\n      dementia in 2010 and according to forecasts, this figure will reach 65.7 million in 2030 and\n      115.4 million in 2050. To correctly estimate the impact of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD), it\n      should be considered that it also affects patients' families, on whom the burden of care\n      fall. Not surprisingly, Alzheimer's disease is called a \"family illness\". Family caregivers\n      of Alzheimer's patients are subject to high levels of stress: this puts them at greater risk\n      of developing mood disorders, depression, insomnia and generally reduces their quality of\n      life. Information technology (IT), telecommunications and electronic equipment applied to\n      the home, can contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of Alzheimer's patients\n      and their caregivers. However, the multidimensionality of this problem not only calls for\n      new services, but also for a greater coordination and integration of existing community\n      health and social care services, of the public, nonprofit and private organizations. The\n      assumption underlying projects integrating health care and social services is to improve\n      coordination of support, thus reducing cost and eliminating waste and inefficiencies and\n      improving health outcomes of the patients assisted. Examples of such initiatives in the\n      literature can be found in the United States (the \"Program for All Inclusive Care for the\n      Elderly\", Branch et al, 1995), in the United Kingdom (the \"Darlington Project\", Challis et\n      al, 1991), in Canada (the PRISMA project, Hebert et al, 2010) and in France (the \"System for\n      Integrated Care for Older Persons\", Beland et al, 2006). Among the tools used in these\n      studies are case management, operator training and the use of IT systems to integrate health\n      care and social services.\n\n      Building on these experiences, the UP-TECH project aims at developing innovative\n      methodologies and new simple technologies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of\n      care for AD patients and their caregivers.\n\n      The main objectives of the UP-TECH project are the evaluation of the improvement of the\n      quality of life of family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease and the potential\n      delay in institutionalization of these patients.\n\n      The overall design of the UP-TECH project will include 450 dyads (AD patient and related\n      caregiver) who will be randomly enrolled in three different types of intervention, defined\n      as\n\n        -  usual care\n\n        -  UP Protocol\n\n        -  UP-TECH Protocol\n\n      fully described below in the section: Interventions."
