Unfortunately several promising antiarrhythmic drugs proved not to be\n      effective in preventing sudden deaths. This project would test whether a relatively\n      inexpensive and presumably innocuous therapy, fish oil supplements, can prevent\n      life-threatening arrhythmias. There is ample basic evidence that n-3 fatty acids contained\n      in fish oil supplements may suppress arrhythmias, and a clinical trial seems warranted.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind.  Patients were randomized to 4\n      grams per day of a PUFA fish oil supplement versus an olive oil placebo. The number of\n      therapeutic discharges were recorded from the ICDs and then confirmed from the recorded\n      electrocardiogram strips with the kinds of arrhythmias which had induced the ICD response.\n      The primary end point, time to first ICD event for ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation\n      (VT or VF) confirmed by stored electrograms or death from any cause, was analyzed by\n      intention to treat."
