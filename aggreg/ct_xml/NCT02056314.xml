    <textblock>
      This study will compare a computerized tutorial to a brochure in terms of their education
      impact of people who wish to end voluntary self-exclusion. Voluntary self-exclusion is a
      program used by people who seek to bar themselves from further access to the casino or other
      gambling venue. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), in cooperation with
      Ontario Lottery and Gaming (OLG), is developing a tutorial designed to provide practical
      information to players who choose to reinstate and return to gambling. The goal of this
      study is to determine if this new computerized tutorial decreases the harm of gambling
      experienced by gamblers who are reinstated. For example, are they less likely to relapsing
      to problematic levels of gambling.

      Voluntary self-exclusion is a program used by people who seek to bar themselves from further
      access to the casino or other gambling venue. Currently there are over 10000 people in the
      program. Although some self-exclusion programs place a permanent ban on the individual,
      others offer the possibility of reinstatement after a period of time. Many problem gamblers
      actually do change their minds about self-exclusion and wish to return to gambling. Centre
      for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), in cooperation with Ontario Lottery and Gaming
      (OLG), is developing a tutorial designed to provide practical information to players who
      choose to reinstate and return to gambling. The goal of this study is to evaluate an the
      intervention to determine its impact on problem gamblers who is reinstated from relapsing to
      problematic levels of gambling. The content for the tutorial will be informed by CAMH, will
      be developed for land based gambling, and also adapted for online gambling as well.
