  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects who know how to operate and own an iPhone, are
      between the age of 19 to 75, and are on a basal/bolus insulin regimen will be included in
      the study.  Subjects will be randomized to two groups - iPhone versus standard of care and
      seen in our clinic at an initial/baseline and three month clinical visit.  The control group
      will e-mail, fax, or call their blood glucose log results once a month for an insulin
      regimen adjustment through verbal communication with a certified diabetic educator once a
      month as is already implemented at the Diabetes Center.  This group will be compared to the
      intervention group who will submit their blood glucose log results through an iPhone mobile
      application, called Diabetes Doctor, once a month for an insulin regimen adjustment by a
      physician with a text message response.  The two groups will have their HbA1c, hypoglycemic
      events, blood glucose dispersion compliance, quality of life, usability and satisfaction
      with the use of a mobile application will be assessed at each visit with surveys.

    <description>Satisfaction and usability will be evaluated with a survey for those subjects who used the mobile phone application at the 3 and 6 months period. The contents of the satisfaction and usability survey include questions addressing the degree of the subjects understanding of operating the mobile application and their ability to comprehend the providers insulin adjustment recommendations. Other questions in the survey assess the degree of the subjects agreement to the insulin adjustment recommendations, how efficiently the subject received a response from their provider, adherence to the mobile application, their assessment of the mobile applications usefulness, their attention given to diabetes and to the mobile application recommendations.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will be instructed to submit their blood glucose logs once a month with the use of a mobile application, Diabetes Doctor, to the provider who will make insulin regimen changes.  All subjects will be evaluated once at initial, 3 month, and 6 month visits. They will receive HbA1c on each visit. After the initial 3 months have been completed a 15 question Diabetes Quality of Life survey will be completed by all patients from both groups. A Usability and Satisfaction of Diabetes Doctor survey will be given to those patients who used the mobile application. At the 3 month interval the control group will be given the opportunity to use the mobile application if desired. The study group will be given the opportunity to continue or discontinue the use of the mobile application. At the 6 month interval the Usability and Satisfaction of Diabetic Doctor survey and 15 question Diabetes Quality of Life survey will be administered to evaluate all mobile application users.</description>

    <description>Diabetes Doctor is a mobile application software.  The mobile phone application allows a subject to register blood glucose values obtained from their fingerstick glucose meter readings, the type and amount of insulin they are administering, any notes they would like to document, and the date and time of each entry.  All data will be entered by the subject manually.  The data will be submitted through encryption coded private servers and can be retrievable by a physician on a password protected website for privacy.  A physician will evaluate this information to recommend a change of the subject's insulin regimen.  The recommended insulin regimen will be delivered to the patient using the same website and received by the subject on the same mobile application software.</description>
