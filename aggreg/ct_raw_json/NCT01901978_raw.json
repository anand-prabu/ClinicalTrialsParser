Our preliminary data suggest that the presence of ectopic fat accumulation\n      and insulin resistance in obese children could be considered an \"early phase\" in the\n      development of T2DM. We hypothesize that a 10% weight loss will restore/improve insulin\n      sensitivity. Furthermore, we speculate that the decrease in subcutaneous fat mass after\n      weight loss is due to a decrease in mean adipocyte cell size, but not cell number."
