      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety of aflibercept in patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
      treated with irinotecan/5FU combination (FOLFIRI) after failure of an oxaliplatin-based
      regimen (patients similar to those evaluated in the VELOUR trial) according to side effects
      prevention and management guidelines.

      Secondary Objective:

      To document the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of aflibercept in this patient
      population.

      Each patient will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death,
      Investigator's decision or patient's refusal for further treatment (whichever come first).
      Patients will be followed-up during treatment and for at least 30 days after its last study
      treatment (either aflibercept or FOLFIRI) administration, up to a maximum of 6 months.

    <description>One (1) hour intravenous infusion on Day 1 followed by FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5-Fluorouracil and leucovorin) administered as follows:
dI-leucovorin infusion over 2 hour on Day 1
Irinotecan: infusion over 90-minute infusion, on Day 1,  followed by bolus 5-FU and 5-FU continuous infusion over 46 hours infusion OR as individualized by physician's clinical judgment.
Treatment cycle to be administered every 2 weeks. Study treatment (aflibercept and FOLFIRI) has to be discontinued upon documentation of disease progression.
If FOLFIRI is permanently discontinued, then aflibercept should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal of further treatment.
If aflibercept is permanently discontinued, then FOLFIRI can be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal of further treatment.
The end of treatment will be the date of the last treatment administration, either aflibercept or FOLFIRI whichever comes last</description>
