A single Ipilimumab treatment 1 mg/kg given on day 15 will be added to daily imatinib mesylate therapy. Dose escalation group first study cycle is 35 days.  Each cycle after that is 21 days. This study has an expansion cohort using the MTD determined by the dose escalation study to treat patients with KITconfirmed GIST, melanoma, and uncategorized solid tumors. Both studies will consist of a screening visit and continuous 21-day treatment cycles. Cycles will be repeated every 21 days for 4 cycles until disease progression or development of intolerable toxicities, and a post-treatment visit."

Up to 4 dose\n      levels of the study drug combination will be tested.  Up to 6 participants will be enrolled\n      at each dose level.  The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level.\n      Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side\n      effects were seen.  This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug\n      combination is found.\n\n      Dose Expansion Group:\n\n      After the highest tolerable dose level of the study drug combination is found, up to 20\n      additional participants will be enrolled in the dose expansion group. Patients with\n      metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), melanoma, or tumors with original tumor\n      biopsies testing positive for KIT mutations (a cancer biomarker) will be eligible to enroll\n      and will receive the highest dose of the study drug combination that was tolerated in the\n      dose escalation group.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If you are in the Dose Escalation Group, the first study cycle is 35 days.  Each cycle after\n      that is 21 days.\n\n      If you are in the Dose Expansion Group, all study cycles are 21 days.\n\n      If you are in the Dose Escalation Group, you will start taking imatinib by mouth 1 time each\n      day for 14 days before you receive ipilimumab.  On Day 15 of each cycle, you will receive a\n      single dose of ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes.  You will continue to take imatinib by\n      mouth 1 time each day.\n\n      If you are in the Dose Expansion Group, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes\n      on Day 15 of each cycle.  You will also take imatinib by mouth 1 time each day of each\n      cycle.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      One (1) time each week during Cycle 1:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be\n           having.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests.\n\n        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests (only during the first week of Cycle 1).\n\n      Every 3 weeks during Cycles 2 and beyond:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.\n\n      Starting after Cycle 2:\n\n        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan after every 2 cycles to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine\n           pregnancy test.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best\n      interest.  You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if\n      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  Imatinib is FDA approved and\n      commercially available for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal\n      tumor (GIST).\n\n      The combination of ipilimumab and imatinib is currently being used for research purposes\n      only.\n\n      Up to 96 participants will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
