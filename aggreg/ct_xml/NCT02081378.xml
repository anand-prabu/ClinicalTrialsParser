  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design of a phase I, open label, dose finding study was chosen in order to establish a
      safe and tolerated dose of ABL001 in CML and Ph+ ALL patients who are relapsed or refractory
      to or are intolerant of TKIs
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human trial with ABL001 is a dose escalation study whose primary purpose is to
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of
      ABL001 administered orally as a single agent to adult patients with CML or Ph+ ALL. The
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABL001 will be assessed together
      with an evaluation of pharmacodynamic (PD) changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMC) and bone marrow aspirates and all data may contribute to the assessment of the RDE.

      An understanding of the MTD/RDE, safety profile, PK/PD relationship, and preliminary
      evidence of anti-CML and ALL activity will be used to inform future development in adults
      with CML and Ph+ ALL. By virtue of its distinct pharmacological profile and by preclinical
      pharmacological studies demonstrating an additive effect, a combination of ABL001 and a
      tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) has the potential to achieve a deeper molecular response in
      a higher proportion of CML patients as compared to single agent TKI therapy.  Such a
      combination has the added advantage of targeting the ABL kinase domain at two distinct
      locations, theoretically preventing single point mutation-associated treatment resistance.
      The prediction is that a nilotinib/ABL001 combination will increase the percentage of
      patients who achieve a complete molecular response (CMR) and decrease the time to CMR,
      thereby increasing the possibility of achieving sustained treatment-free remissions in these
      patients. In addition, some patients may be intolerant of therapy with TKIs or may develop
      mutations that promote resistance to TKI therapy. In these patients, ABL001 may provide a
      novel therapeutic option.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic or accelerated  phase who
        were previously treated with  two different TKIs prior to study entry and are relapsed,

        Patients with Ph+ ALL must have a cytopathologically confirmed diagnosis of Ph+ ALL and be
        relapsed or refractory to one prior TKI or intolerant of TKIs. TKI failure for Ph+ ALL
