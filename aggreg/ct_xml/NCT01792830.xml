  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most cardiac (heart) bypass surgery (CABG) patients develop high blood sugar while they are
      in the hospital. No studies have shown what the best insulin regimen is for CABG patients
      with type 2 diabetes after going home from the hospital.  Accordingly, patients with high
      blood sugar and diabetes after cardiac bypass surgery will be followed for 3 months to look
      at how well their treatment(s) for diabetes work after discharge. Patients with diabetes
      will be discharged (sent home) on diabetes pills or with insulin glargine injections based
      on their sugar control. Patients with admission  A1c &lt; 7% (a laboratory value that shows the
      average sugar level in the body over 3 months) will be discharged on the same diabetes
      medications that they used before coming to the hospital.. Those with an A1c between 7% and
      9% will be discharged on insulin glargine at 50-80% of the dose used in the hospital and
      their home diabetes pills. Those with an A1c &gt; 9% will be discharged on glargine at 80-100%
      of  the dose used in the hospital in addition their home diabetes pill or with insulin
      glargine and insulin glulisine. The primary outcome will be a change in A1c at 4 and 12
      weeks after discharge.  Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled in CABG discharge trial.
