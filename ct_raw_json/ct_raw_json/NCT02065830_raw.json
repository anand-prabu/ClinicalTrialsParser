            "textblock": "In this study, 30  participants with chronic spinal cord injury will undergo a 8-week\n      training schedule for ambulation with the EKSO\u2122 device.\n\n      Ekso\u2122 is a wearable bionic suit which enables individuals with any amount of lower extremity\n      weakness to stand up and walk over ground with a natural, full weight bearing, reciprocal\n      gait. Walking is achieved by the user's weight shifts to activate sensors in the device\n      which initiate steps. Battery-powered motors drive the legs, replacing deficient\n      neuromuscular function.\n\n      Ekso provides functional based rehabilitation, over ground gait training, and upright,\n      weight bearing exercise unlike any other. It has been designed for the needs of busy\n      therapists treating a wide range of patients in a single day. The suit is strapped over the\n      users\u00b4 clothing with easy adjustments to transition between patients in as little as five\n      minutes.\n\n      Before, during and after training sessions the subjects will perform standardised\n      assessments and complete questionnaires to assess the functional and psychological effects\n      of the exoskeleton."
