      Part 1, the pharmacokinetic (PK) phase, will expand upon the pilot study conducted at Naval
      Medical Research Laboratory (NAMRL) and has the goal of determining bioavailability and time
      to Cmax in a larger representative sample. Part 2, the efficacy phase, is to determine the
      efficacy of the aqueous spray solution via exposure to a nausea-inducing stimulus.

      Part 1: The pharmacokinetic (PK) phase Objective: To determine the bioavailability and
      amount of scopolamine absorbed after administration of 0.2 mg intranasal scopolamine at
      regular intervals across 8 hours post- dose.

      Hypothesis: Detectable levels of Intranasal scopolamine (INSCOP) will be present in subject
      plasma within 15 minutes post-dose; mean time to Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) will be
      less than 1.5 hr.

      Part 2: The Efficacy phase Objective: To determine the effectiveness, cognitive performance
      effects, and medication side-effect profile of 0.2 mg intranasal scopolamine spray as a
      motion sickness (MS) countermeasure.

      Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that the INSCOP spray will be more efficacious against
      MS than placebo, without statistically significant cognitive performance side-effects.
      Specifically, participants will tolerate significantly more provocative head tilts in the
      INSCOP condition than in the placebo condition.
