            "textblock": "Mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes are the primary cause of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer\n      syndrome. Genetic testing identifies mutation carriers and enables them to manage their\n      cancer risk (i.e. chemoprevention, risk-reducing surgery, or intensive surveillance).\n      However, uptake of genetic testing among at-risk individuals is low, implying that\n      information about the disease and genetic testing is not being communicated effectively\n      among family members. Mutation carriers are distressed about disclosing test results, while\n      their relatives do not understand the implications of a positive test result for their own\n      health. Thus, interventions that support family communication about genetic risk, and\n      address psychological distress of family members could contribute to more effective\n      management of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer.\n\n      The project aims to develop a family communication and decision-support intervention to 1)\n      increase family communication about BRCA1/2 mutations; 2) reduce psychological distress\n      associated with these mutations; and 3) increase informed decision-making regarding uptake\n      of BRCA1/2 testing among at-risk family members. Focus groups with mutation carriers and\n      at-risk relatives will inform the refinement of the intervention, as well as timing and mode\n      of delivery. Two group, pre-post test study with a new sample of mutation carriers and\n      family members will be used to test the feasibility, acceptability, and effect of the\n      intervention."
