  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the promising results with hypofractionated in low and intermediate risk
      prostate cancer, our proposal is to translate this experience to patients with high risk
      prostate cancer.  Patients with high risk disease would receive hypofractionated RT to the
      prostate and to the external and internal iliac lymph nodes using IMRT plus long-term
      hormonal therapy.  The objective of the study is to show that long term grade&gt;2 late
      toxicity is acceptable and similar to published data using hypofractionated technique in the
      prostate only.
