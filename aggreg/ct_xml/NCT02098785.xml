  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, liver related morbidity and mortality continue to rise. It is the 5th commonest
      cause of death in the UK. Liver damage consists of two main components - a) damage to the
      cells of the liver, called hepatocytes, meaning the liver cannot function properly leading
      to jaundice (yellow appearance of the skin and/or eyes) and liver failure and b) scarring of
      the liver, called Cirrhosis, leading to impaired function and inadequate blood flow through
      the liver with potential to develop into cancer. Manifestations of this state include
      ascites (fluid in the tummy) and varices (swollen blood vessels in the food pipe). Liver
      transplant is currently the only curative treatment for end stage chronic liver disease.
      Unfortunately its high demand has not been matched by an equivalent rise in liver donations
      and even when a transplant has occurred there are numerous lifestyle effects such as
      immunosuppression and kidney impairment thus outcome remains poor for many patients. Coffee
      has been shown to have mortality benefit in humans and drinking two to three cups a day was
      associated with a 40% reduced risk of developing cirrhosis, particularly alcohol related;
      and higher the more cups consumed. Previous work has demonstrated coffee reduces the level
      of fibrosis in the liver by interrupting signalling pathways, blocking the effects of
      special products, called cytokines, and reducing accumulation of iron. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that given the potential for caffeine to be used as a treatment in SSAO
      activity associated diseases it is important to see if the activity of SSAO can be blocked
      in healthy humans too. The Investigators' aim to examine the effect of caffeine on
      circulating VAP-1 levels in large numbers of healthy volunteers to assess its potential as
      an attractive therapeutic target in view of its low toxicity and widespread availability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One such enzyme known as VAP-1 (vascular adhesion protein-1) is expressed at high levels in
      liver endothelial cells and studies involving blockage of VAP-1 activity have demonstrated
      it is involved in a reaction where break down products such as hydrogen peroxide and ammonia
      active signalling pathways to assist in the movement of cells from blood vessels to the
      liver. VAP-1 levels become elevated during chronic inflammation in blood vessels of the gut,
      tonsils, skin and synovium albeit most selectively in liver. Recently, circulating VAP-1 has
      been demonstrated to be elevated in certain liver diseases particularly alcoholic liver
      disease. Initial animal studies have shown that activity of the enzyme SSAO
      (Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase) can be effectively blocked by caffeine
      administration and that caffeine also blocks the activity of fat cells, known as adipose
      cells, thus protective against obesity too. SSAO arises from the same family of enzymes as
      VAP-1 thus importantly shares transferable properties. This information led to small,
      experimental studies in human liver that corroborate these findings but did not show how
      caffeine was affecting VAP-1 in the blood.
