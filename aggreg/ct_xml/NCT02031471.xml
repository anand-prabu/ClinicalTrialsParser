  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously
      administered RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in monotherapy and/or in combination with
      methotrexate and other non-biologic DMARDs in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who
      are naïve to RoActemra/Actemra. Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg
      subcutaneously weekly for 24 weeks. Patients who complete the core study achieving at least
      a moderate EULAR response at Week 24 may enter the extension phase and receive
      RoActemra/Actemra for a further 28 weeks at the most.
