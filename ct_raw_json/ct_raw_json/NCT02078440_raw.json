            "textblock": "The objective of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability, and the rate and\n      extent of absorption of bromocriptine in male and female children and adolescent Type 2\n      Diabetes Mellitus patients, aged 10 to less than 18, under fed conditions.\n\n      It is undetermined if the pharmacokinetic profile of bromocriptine-QR in type 2 diabetes\n      children aged 10- to less than 18 years differs appreciably from that in healthy adults.\n      Bromocriptine is extensively metabolized by the liver (namely CYP3A4). Studies in children\n      have demonstrated little difference in clearance among children over 10 years of age\n      compared to adults (Blanco et al, 2000). However, differences in blood volumes or other\n      factors may impart differences that could affect the pharmacokinetic properties of\n      bromocriptine-QR. Therefore, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics in children aged\n      10-to less than 18 years who have type 2 diabetes. After describing the profile of\n      bromocriptine-quick release in this patient population, a follow on study will be conducted\n      to evaluate its safety and efficacy in treating children and adolescents who have type 2\n      diabetes.\n\n      The pharmacokinetic profile of bromocriptine will be determined following the administration\n      of a single, weight-adjusted dose of CYCLOSET (bromocriptine mesylate) tablets.  The study\n      will be a single period, bioavailability study in 30 patients.  The study duration will be 3\n      days."
