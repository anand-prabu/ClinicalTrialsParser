            "textblock": "Inserting a telescope into the womb to identify and treat problems with bleeding, pain or\n      reproduction is the commonest surgical intervention in gynaecology.  This procedure is known\n      as a 'hysteroscopy'.  In recent times the equipment used to perform hysteroscopy have become\n      smaller such that it is routinely carried out without anaesthetic in an outpatient hospital\n      or community clinic.  The established 'traditional' technique for introducing the\n      hysteroscope into the womb involves the use of a 'speculum', which is inserted into the\n      vagina.  A speculum is the metal or plastic instrument used to stretch and separate the\n      vaginal walls so that the opening to the womb, known as the 'cervix' can be seen.  The\n      cervix is then cleaned and frequently grasped with a sharp toothed forcep to provide\n      traction before the hysteroscope is inserted.  Whilst hysteroscopy is safe, it is known that\n      pain during the procedure can lead to a poor patient experience, and even trigger fainting\n      episodes or failure to complete the procedure.  As the hysteroscopes have become smaller, it\n      has been recognised that it is possible to access the cervix and womb (i.e. 'uterus')\n      directly using the hysteroscopic vision without inserting any of these potentially pain\n      inducing vaginal instruments.  There is however, uncertainty whether this newer technique\n      known as 'vaginoscopy' or the 'no touch technique' will minimise the pain experienced by the\n      patient or reduce the propensity to fainting.  Futhermore, even if vaginoscopy is shown to\n      be less painful, the technique may be more prone to failure due to an inability to\n      transverse the cervix and enter the uterus without additional instruments.  Post-operative\n      infection rates of the uterus may also be higher due to vaginal contamination.\n\n      Reducing pain and complications and improving success of the procedure as well as optimising\n      patients experience is important because hysteroscopy is an intimate examination, known to\n      be associated with significant anxiety and pain.  Furthermore, the procedure is widely\n      practised representing the most common surgical intervention in day-to-day gynaecological\n      practice in the UK and elsewhere.  It is therefore important, and timely given that\n      outpatient hysteroscopy is increasing especially in community settings, that a large, high\n      quality randomised controlled trial comparing 'vaginoscopy' and the 'traditional'\n      hysteroscopy is undertaken to resolve the uncertainty as to whether vaginoscopy is less\n      painful, safe and more successful than existing approaches to hysteroscopy."
