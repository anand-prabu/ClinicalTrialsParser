  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus in the literature on the best way to treat cystic lesions of the
      pituitary area. Patients who are symptomatic from these tumours are rare. The cystic form of
      tumours present special challenges since traditional treatment modalities (surgery and/or
      external radiation) are often not able to completely remove or treat the cyst wall without
      major morbidity or even mortality.

      There is no 'best practice' for the treatment of cystic tumours per se. Treatments available
      to patients with cystic sellar/parasellar tumours  include conservative management using a
      'wait and scan' approach, cyst drainage, and cyst removal via transsphenoidal and/or
      craniotomy approach (i.e. open surgery). Over the last 10 years we have treated
      approximately 8 patients with intracystic radiotherapy. All of these patients continue to be
      monitored clinically and radiologically and all have done well with stable regression of the
      cysts and no new neurological deficits. Over the past 2 years, 90yttrium colloid has been
      provided to CDHA through Health Canada's Special Access Program (SAP). It has only been of
      recent that Health Canada has requested a clinical trial to assess the benefit of
      intracystic radiotherapy over other available treatment options.

      The experimental treatment being proposed is the stereotactic intracavitary instillation of
      90yttrium colloid for treatment of cystic lesions of the pituitary (sellar) and surrounding
      areas (parasellar).
