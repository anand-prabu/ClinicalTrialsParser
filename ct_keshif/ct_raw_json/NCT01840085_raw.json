If ulcers heal during the treatment period the subjects will continue to be\n      followed bi-weekly via phone call for follow-up.  If during the follow-up (observation)\n      period ulcers recur or new ones appear which qualify the subject to enter a new treatment\n      cycle, a clinic visit is scheduled and a new treatment period begins.  Subjects with\n      qualifying ulcers may complete as many treatment and washout periods as required during the\n      study period."
