  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disturbances of mineral and bone diseaeses are frequently observed in CKD patients. Renal
      osteodystrophy is the term to describe the bone abnormalities. Epidemiological data showed
      adynamic bone disease (ABD) is the most frequent bone disorder in CKD stage 5D diseases. Low
      PTH, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, metabolic acidosis, hypogonadism and low 1,25(OH)2D
      vitamin D deficiency are known risk factors for ABD. Mounting experimental data point
      towards a role of protein-bound uremic retention molecules (p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl
      sulfate) in the pathogenesis and progression of ABD. ABD is not only recognized as a risk
      factor for fractures but also for arterial calcification.

      The aim of the present study is  (1) to investigate the role of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl
      sulfate in the pathogenesis and progression of ABD and arterial calcification in CKD stage5
      and (2) to investigate the influence of renal transplantation on bone and arterial
      metabolism.
