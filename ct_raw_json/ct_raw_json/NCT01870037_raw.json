Following screening visits(V1 and V1A) and study\n      drug administration at week 0, eligible participants will be evaluated for safety post\n      dosing with study drug at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24.\n\n      At Screening, Baseline (prior to dosing) and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks post dosing\n      participants will have a complete physical exam including urogenital examination.   ECG will\n      be performed at Screening, at Baseline, at one week post dosing and at the final visit.\n\n      At Screening, Baseline (prior to dosing) and 1, 2, 4, 12 and 24 weeks post dosing,\n      laboratory evaluations including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be performed.\n      Urine cultures will be done throughout the study (including prior to catheterization and at\n      discharge) to insure the absence of infection.\n\n      Participants will be assessed for study drug effects on incontinence at Baseline (prior to\n      dosing) and at weeks 4 and 24 post dosing by cystometry.   At Screening (V1) and at 2, 8 and\n      24 weeks post dosing participants will have a bladder scan to evaluate for residual volume.\n\n      Subjects will complete a daily diary at home for 7 days prior to the baseline (V2).  Diaries\n      will capture number of micturitions, volume of micturitions, number of urge incontinence\n      episodes, and rating of episode, and the number of pads used every 24 hours.  The\n      participants will continue to complete this daily diary during the course of the trial and\n      the diary will be evaluated at each follow-up visit.\n\n      The participants will evaluate their perception of their bladder condition, QoL using Kings\n      Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and SF-12. International Consultation on Incontinence\n      Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) will be completed throughout the study."
