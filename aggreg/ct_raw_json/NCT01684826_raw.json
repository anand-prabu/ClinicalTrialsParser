This is realized by anatomy-specific optimization of the full acquisition\n      chain (grid switch, beam filtering, pulse width, spot size, detector and image processing\n      engine) for every clinical task individually. Furthermore, smaller focal spot sizes and\n      shorter pulses are used, which are known to positively influence image quality . The final\n      effect on the clinical image quality is investigated in this study."

The increasingly complex nature of many of the\n      interventions performed requires the use of significant amounts of radiation for their\n      completion. Of particular relevance to dose reduction concerns are obese patients, for whom\n      additional radiation is often necessary to obtained sufficient diagnostic quality, as well\n      as patients suffering from chronic total coronary occlusions (CTO), for whom long procedures\n      with extended radiation time and contrast usage are common.\n\n      In order to introduce a dose reduction technology the most important aspect is to validate\n      the diagnostic image information. Philips has developed a new algorithm that is capable to\n      process images with similar image quality but acquired at lower dose."
