Determine the response rate and duration of response to doxorubicin HCl\n      liposome and paclitaxel in patients with endometrial cancer, tubal cancers, and sarcomas and\n      carcinosarcomas (mixed mesodermal tumors) of gynecologic origin. II. Define the safety\n      profile of the combination of doxorubicin HCl liposome and paclitaxel in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into two groups. Group 1 consists of patients with\n      untreated endometrial and tubal cancers and Group 2 consists of patients with sarcomas and\n      carcinosarcomas (mixed mesodermal tumors) of gynecologic origin subdivided into no or prior\n      therapy. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome intravenously on day 1 of each treatment\n      course. Paclitaxel is administered intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of each course.\n      Courses are repeated every 21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxic\n      effects or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every\n      6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-60 patients will be accrued for this study."
