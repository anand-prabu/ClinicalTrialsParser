    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, open-label study.  After providing informed consent, subjects
      will undergo an outpatient screening period of up to 21 days.  Screening procedures will
      include an assessment of mental status which will be repeated before dosing.  Eligible
      subjects will then undergo hospital intake procedures and reside at the investigational site
      until Day 5.  Subjects will be enrolled in 5-treatment groups as follows: (1) Group 1:
      Subjects with hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh A; (2) Group 2: Subjects with
      hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh B; (3) Group 3:  Subjects with hepatic
      impairment classified as Child-Pugh C; (4) Group 4:  Subjects with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
      infection but without hepatic impairment; and (5) Group 5:  Subjects without hepatic disease
      or impairment. Group 5 is used as a control group

             severe pruritus after opioid treatment

          -  Subject has a known intolerance or hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone or
             any excipients in the Suboxone tablet formulation

          -  In the judgment of the investigator, any other condition that would preclude safe,
             useful, or consistent participation in the study

          -  Use of any investigational medication or investigational medical device in the 30
             days before informed consent

          -  History or current acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies

          -  More than 1 missed appointment during Screening

          -  Currently under mandate by the criminal justice system or Child and Family Services
             to participate in drug abuse treatment

          -  Participation in drug or alcohol dependence treatment in the 30 days before informed
             consent

          -  Positive urine drug screen result for amphetamines, methamphetamine, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, opioids, oxycodone,
             or phencyclidine which, in the judgment of the investigator, is indicative of
             non-prescribed drug use; and/or positive urine alcohol screen result in which, in the
             judgment of the investigator, is indicative of alcohol abuse or alcoholism

          -  Consumption of prohibited medications within 1 week of informed consent, including
             buprenorphine

          -  Consumption of grapefruit and grapefruit juice for at least one week before the study
