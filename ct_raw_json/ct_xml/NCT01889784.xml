  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the phototherapy may be adjuvant to exercise to
      improve muscular efficiency and increase aerobic capacity. We hypothesized that phototherapy
      adjuvant with physical exercise may be benefit to populations with Diabetes mellitus that
      have impairment in cardiopulmonary fitness and low oxygen uptake peak values (VO2peak) in
      exercise tests.

    <description>20 men with diabetes mellitus will receive effective-phototherapy (cluster multi-diode containing 50 LEDs applied for 60 seconds over muscle quadriceps bilaterally) or Placebo-phototherapy using the same device and procedures. Effective and placebo phototherapy will be performed 2 times each and the sequence will be random, with 14 days of rest between evaluations. The therapies will be applied 5 minutes before dynamic physical exercise of constant workload and moderate intensity to evaluate the phototherapy effect in muscle oxygen uptake evaluated through near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (Oxymon system, Artinis Medical Systems, Netherlands). The optode of NIRS will be fixed on quadriceps muscle in the right side.</description>

    <description>The intervention of this study is phototherapy through light emitting diode (LED). The Effective-LED or Placebo-LED will be applied in femoral quadriceps muscle bilaterally 5 minutes before constant-load exercise tests in bike. Each individual will perform two tests with Effective-LED and two tests with Placebo-LED randomly allocated. Evaluations will be completed in 4 days in total, respecting 14 days of rest to ensure the long washout phototherapy.</description>

    <description>The near-infrared radiation by light emitting diode (LED) will be performed with a cluster multi-diode 157 arranged in an array of 34x18 cm containing 50 LEDs (GaAlAs, 850 nm, class 2M 158 LED). The phototherapy will be applied bilaterally on femoral quadriceps muscle during 60 seconds with 3J of total energy. Neither subject nor evaluators will known if LED was effective or placebo during data collection. A hidden button in the LED device is employed to ensure the double-blind procedure. This button allows selecting placebo or effective emission of near-infrared radiation while the time display is working. This button will be selected by a researcher who just participated of randomization procedure and LED application and had no access to data collection.</description>
