            "textblock": "Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is an orphan disease caused by the pathogenic vicious\n      circle including infection, inflammation and airway repair. Today's principle of treatment\n      is to break the cycle of inflammation and infection. Nowadays, most clinical trials are\n      anti-infective treatment by antibiotics trying to break this cycle by reducing the bacterial\n      load, which may cause bacterial resistance. There were still some anti-inflammation trials\n      by using inhaled corticosteroids(ICS). Tsang and Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda showed that inhaled\n      corticosteroids reduced IL-1,IL-8 levels and sputum inflammation cells, and improved sputum\n      volume as well as quality of life, though the corticosteroid must be high dose or medium\n      dose combined with long-acting \u00df2 adrenergic agonists. As described in asthma and chronic\n      obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), theophylline can improve the activity of histone\n      deacetylase (HDAC) and then enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of steroids. We hypothesis\n      that theophylline may have the same effect in subjects with bronchiectasis. Theophylline\n      plus inhaled low-dose formoterol-budesonide may improve quality of life and reduce airway\n      inflammation."
