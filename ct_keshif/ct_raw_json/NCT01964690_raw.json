Some\n      analyzers (EKF diagnostics Lactate Scout*) can give results in 15 seconds.\n\n      We hypothesized that capillary lactate, easy to sample, tested with this analyzer may detect\n      earlier those infections states and we want to find the most accurate site to detect severe\n      sepsis (capillary, venous or arterial sample)."

However, results are usually slow\n      to obtain, especially if we want to respect the Surving Sepsis Campaign, which preconize\n      antibiotic as soon as possible (first hour).\n\n      In admission room, arterial sample can't be easily done and usual results need more than 30\n      minutes. On the contrary, using analyzers like \"EKF diagnostics Lactate Scout*\" can give\n      results faster with capillary blood (15 seconds). We will compare this results with both\n      veinous and arterial lactate.\n\n        -  For primary outcome, we will determine the most accurate value of capillary or veinous\n           lactate that may be able to detect critical patient suspected of infection.\n\n        -  for secondary outcomes, we will determine if quick capillary lactate test may replace\n           arterial lactate in this indication and be able to predict mortality."
