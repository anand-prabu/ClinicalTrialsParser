Determine the time to progression in these patients\n      after this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of trastuzumab in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to histology: intercalated duct (adenoid cystic\n      carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade\n      adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) vs excretory duct (squamous cell\n      carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma). Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes\n      weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
