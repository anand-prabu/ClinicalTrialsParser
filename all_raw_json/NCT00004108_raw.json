II. Assess the\n      quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this treatment regimen in this patient\n      population. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DX-8951 in plasma.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive DX-8951f IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats\n      every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months."
