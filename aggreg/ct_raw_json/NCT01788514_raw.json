            "textblock": "Each year, during the fall and winter, coinciding with the influenza season, the number of\n      health care visits and the number of days missed from school increases due to febrile\n      respiratory illnesses. The highest rates of influenza infections are present amongst\n      school-age children. The vaccination against seasonal influenza remains the most important\n      measure to prevent infection and to combat the overall spread of the virus. School-age\n      children, in particular, adolescents, may not be aware of the need for influenza\n      vaccination.\n\n      Interactive computerized educational programs have been developed and used in different\n      pediatric settings in an attempt to increase children's understanding of their medical\n      condition, and improve adherence to the treatment.\n\n      The investigators identified one of our satellite pediatric clinics, as being the perfect\n      venue for an intervention that will attempt to increase influenza vaccination. The clinic is\n      located in an underserved area. More than 9,000 children are seen annually in this clinic\n      with about 20% of the patients age 8 and above. A pediatric pulmonary office, part of the\n      pediatric clinic, serves a high number of patients, most of whom have poorly controlled\n      asthma.\n\n      Currently, no focused, developmentally appropriate education programs regarding vaccination\n      are used in our outpatient clinics.\n\n      The investigators propose implementing an influenza vaccination educational program in this\n      pediatric satellite office that serves a population that has historical low rates of\n      influenza vaccination.\n\n      The investigators have developed an influenza-vaccination-education-study-program that will\n      involve the use of an animated influenza vaccine-based computer program (videogame) that is\n      designed from the investigator's own initiative. This videogame should provide a basis or\n      foundation to discuss the need for influenza vaccination and the adverse effects of\n      influenza disease. It will be designed to intrigue the child by providing animated tours and\n      creative experiences that are designed to encourage behavioral changes towards the need for\n      vaccination.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis that by using this hybrid entertainment-educational tool, we\n      will increase children's knowledge about influenza disease and the need for influenza\n      vaccination. By using this age appropriate intervention, we aim to decrease children and\n      adolescent's anxiety related to the vaccination and to increase vaccination rates. The\n      investigators hypothesis that our intervention will have a high impact since it is geared to\n      an ethnic community with historically low rates of influenza vaccination."
