  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the study
      drug, AM-101. AM-101 is tested for the treatment of tinnitus that started as the result of
      an injury to the inner ear or due to middle ear inflammation (otitis media). Subjects with
      tinnitus can take part in the study, if their tinnitus started within the last 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase III study is assessing the drug's safety and is aiming to demonstrate efficacy of
      repeated intratymanic AM-101 injections in the treatment of acute peripheral tinnitus (up to
      3 months from onset).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Persistent subjective peripheral tinnitus  (unilateral or bilateral) following
             traumatic cochlear injury (acute acoustic trauma, blast trauma, middle ear surgery,
             inner ear barotrauma, tympanic membrane trauma) or otitis media with onset no longer
             than 3 months prior to randomization

          2. Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years;

          3. Negative pregnancy test (woman of childbearing potential);

             protection is not possible or ensured;

          5. Willing and able to protect ear canal and middle ear from water exposure as long as
             tympanic membrane is not fully closed.
