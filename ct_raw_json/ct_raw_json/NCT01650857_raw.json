Initial trials with limited numbers of patients were encouraging. Investigation of\n      larger cohorts is essential to assess the efficacy of rehabilitation programmes in PH.\n\n      We hypothesize that a 3 week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves PC, BC and\n      HRQOL in patients with PH in functional classes (FC) II and III. Critical ill patients with\n      a functional class IV are excluded. All patients with PH undergo a 3-week inpatient\n      rehabilitation program (interval bicycle and strength training, physiotherapy, psychological\n      support, education). Exercise testing (peak work load (PWL) 6-min-walk distance), body\n      composition (bioimpedance analysis BIA: lean body mass (LBM), body cell mass (BCM), BCM/LBM\n      ratio, phase angle (PA)) and HRQOL (SF 36 questionnaire) are assessed at baseline and\n      completion of PR."
