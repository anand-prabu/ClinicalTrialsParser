Subjects with\n      unacceptable pain-reporting ability at the conclusion of the Pain Training Period will be\n      discontinued from the study.\n\n      Part 2 of the study will consist of three consecutive double-blind crossover periods.  Each\n      crossover period will include 31 days of double-blind treatment.  A follow-up visit will\n      occur 14 \u00b1 7 days after the last dose of study medication.\n\n      One of three treatments (placebo, pregabalin, or pregabalin + AZD5213) will be administered\n      during each crossover treatment period, as determined by a randomly assigned treatment\n      sequence.\n\n      Approximately 65 subjects will be screened in Part 1 of the study, in order to randomize up\n      to approximately 32 subjects in Part 2 of the study."

Subjects must provide\n        informed consent in accordance with local regulations before the conduct of any\n        study-related procedures.  The informed consent should reflect the protocol stipulations\n        concerning the use of contraception. 3. Diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus\n        for at least 1 year prior to Screen.  4. Diabetes-related painful neuropathy for at least\n        6 months prior to Screen. 5.  Pain that began in the feet and is symmetric or nearly\n        symmetric.  6.  Diabetes has been clinically stable for at least 2 months prior to Screen,\n        and between Screen and baseline (Day 35).  7.  At Screen and baseline, score of at least 4\n        on Item 5 (\"average pain\") of the modified Brief Pain Inventory for patients with painful\n        diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BPI-DPN).  8.  Able to participate in all scheduled\n        evaluations and to complete all required tests and procedures.  9.  In the opinion of the\n        investigator, the subject must be considered likely to comply with the study protocol and\n        to have a high probability of completing the study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        1. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to pregabalin.  2.  Clinically important illness or\n        infection (e.g., chronic, persistent, or acute infection) within 30 days prior to screen\n        or between screen adn baseline.  3.  Presence of any psychiatric or neurologic disorder or\n        any other disorder or symptom, if, in the judgement of the investigator, the disorder or\n        symptom is likely to confound interpretation of drug effect or affect the subject's\n        ability to complete the study.  Any clinically important abnormality, as determined by\n        investigator at Screen or baseline, in physical or neurologic examination, vital sign,\n        ECG, or clinical laboratory test results that could be detrimental to the subject, or\n        could affect the subject's ability to complete the study.  4.  Initiation or change in\n        intensity or frequency of non-pharmacologic therapy for PDN, including psychotherapy,\n        physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, acupressure, or chiropractic care, within 3 months\n        prior to baseline)."
