  <brief_title>Study of Efficacy and Safety of MK-5172 + MK-8742 in Chronic Hepatitis C Participants With Child-Pugh (CP)-B Hepatic Insufficiency (MK-5172-059)</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug combination MK-5172
      + MK-8742 in participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype (GT) 1, 4-6 infection and
      who have cirrhosis and Child-Pugh (CP) score 7-9 moderate hepatic insufficiency. The primary
      hypothesis is that the percentage of HCV-infected participants with hepatic insufficiency
      (the CP-B population) achieving sustained viral response (SVR) 12 weeks after the end of all
      treatment (SVR12) will be greater than 60%. Additionally, ten non-cirrhotic HCV-infected GT1
      participants will also be given MK-5172 + MK-8742 at the beginning of the study; this will
      be done for the purpose of collecting plasma pharmacokinetic data in HCV GT1-infected
      participants who do not have hepatic insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted sequentially in 3 Parts.  Each participant will participate in
      only one Part.

      Participants will be enrolled in either Part A, Part B, or Part C:

        -  Part A: CP-B participants will receive MK-5172 50 mg/ MK-8742 50 mg; non-cirrhotic
           participants will receive MK-5172 100 mg/MK-8742 50 mg.

        -  Part B: CP-B participants will receive MK-5172 100 mg/MK-8742 50 mg.

        -  Part C: CP-B participants will receive either MK-5172 50 mg or 100 mg/MK-8742 50 mg.

      Study progression from Part A to Part B and from Part B to Part C will be based upon a
      review of safety and efficacy in Parts A and B, respectively.  Depending upon safety and
      efficacy in Part A, the study may progress directly from Part A to Part C using MK-5172 50
      mg/MK-8742 50 mg, without performing Part B.
