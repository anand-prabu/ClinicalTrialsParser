The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is\n             associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles\n             or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking.  Although COPD affects the lungs, it\n             also produces significant systemic consequences.\n\n          -  Tobacco use: Subjects with a current or prior history of >=10 pack-years of cigarette\n             smoking at screening (Visit 1).
