  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are approximately 3.2
      million people in the United States infected with hepatitis C and a significant percentage
      of these patients are unaware of their diagnosis.  This study will attempt to determine the
      point prevalence of undiagnosed hepatitis C infection in an urban hospital population.  All
      patients admitted to the hospital on two separate days will have hepatitis C testing done on
      leftover serum and plasma that was collected as part of routine inpatient lab work.  Our
      primary goal is to determine the number of undiagnosed hepatitis C infected patients in our
      hospitalized population.  We will also compare these rates to specific demographic
      characteristics, such as age, race, gender, zip code and type of insurance to see if any
      associations exist between these demographics and undiagnosed hepatitis C infection.
