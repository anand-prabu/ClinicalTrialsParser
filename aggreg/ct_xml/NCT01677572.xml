      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of
      BIIB037 administered via intravenous (IV) infusions in subjects with prodromal or mild
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be eligible for a
      dose-blinded long-term extension (LTE), following the double-blinded placebo-controlled
      portion, with all subjects receiving BIIB037.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BIIB037 is an investigational product being developed as a disease modification treatment
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD). BIIB037 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that recognizes
      amyloid plaques. In animal models of Alzheimer's disease, treatment with BIIB037 was shown
      to decrease beta amyloid content in animal brain. A single ascending dose study of BIIB037
      in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is ongoing. This study will be
      conducted in subjects with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile after multiple doses of
      BIIB037.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must meet criteria for Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Mild
             Alzheimer's Disease (AD):

               1. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 20-30,

               2. Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) score of 0.5 or 1.0, and

               3. a free recall score of lesser or equal to 27 on the Free and Cued Selective
                  Reminding Test (FCSRT) for prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

          -  Subjects must have a positive florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid
             scan.

          -  Subjects must consent to apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping.

          -  Apart from clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), subject must be in good
             health.

          -  Must have a reliable informant or caregiver.

        Inclusion Criteria for the Long Term Extension (LTE), candidates must meet the following
        eligibility criteria at Week 56:

          1. Subject must have completed the placebo-controlled portion of the study. Subject must
             have received 11 or more doses, and must not have missed more than 2 consecutive
             doses; subjects who don't meet this criteria can only enter the Long Term Extension
             (LTE) upon Sponsor's approval.

          2. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &gt;10 at the Week 54 visit.

          3. Subject (or subject's legal representative) has the ability to understand the purpose
             and risks of the study and provide signed and dated informed consent (or assent) and

          -  Have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Have a significant systematic illness or infection in past 30 days.

          -  Brain MRI showing evidence of acute or sub-acute micro or macrohemorrhage, greater
             than 4 microhemorrhages, cortical infarct or greater than one 1 lunar infarct.

          -  Any contraindications to brain MRI or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

          -  Negative positron emission tomography (PET) scan with any amyloid-targeting ligand
             within 48 weeks of Screening.

          -  Clinically significant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities.

          -  Alcohol or substance abuse in past 1 year.

          -  Taking blood thinners (except for aspirin at a prophylactic dose or less)

          -  Have changes in medications or doses of medication in past 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria for Long-term Extension:

        Any medical or psychiatric contraindication or clinically significant abnormality that, in
