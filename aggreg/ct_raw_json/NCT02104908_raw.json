The target-controlled propofol infusion is started\n      immediately after positioning the patient on the operating table. The initial target\n      concentration was 0.5\u03bcg/mL. The infusion rate is adjusted every 5min by increasing or\n      decreasing the target concentration by 0.2\u03bcg/mL steps based on the patients' respiratory\n      rate(RR), blood pressure(BP), heart rate(HR), and level of sedation(score of 5 on Ramsay\n      Sedation Scale ). The minimal, maximal, optimal target concentration, cumulative propofol\n      dose, frequency of spontaneous movement and incidences of associated complications are\n      recorded. Patients were phoned for followup and questioned for activity status in one year.\n      If the patients were dead, date of death; if they survived, daily living activity\n      questioned."
