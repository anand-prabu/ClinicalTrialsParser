            "textblock": "Purpose: Implement a randomized trial to test whether offering compensation to older men\n      conditional on their coming for medical male circumcision can increase uptake of\n      circumcision services.\n\n      Participants: 1,500 uncircumcised men of ages 25-49 in Nyando District, 21 men who chose to\n      be circumcised and 21 who did not get circumcised, 10 female partners of men who became\n      circumcised and 10 female partners of men who did not will be interviewed\n\n      Procedures (methods): To increase uptake of male circumcision, investigators will offer\n      conditional economic compensation for male circumcision. Randomly selected study\n      participants will be given the opportunity, conditional on undergoing male circumcision, to\n      obtain food vouchers that are intended to offset the cost of accessing the VMMC services and\n      the potential lost work the day of the procedure and in the 2 days following the procedure.\n      The food vouchers will be given after study participants choose to uptake VMMC services at\n      any of the static or outreach sites operated by Impact Research and Development Organization\n      (IRDO). Participants will be randomized to one of three intervention groups or to a control\n      group. Participants in the intervention groups will have the opportunity to receive a food\n      voucher valued at one of three amounts (in KES, Kenyan Shillings) if they choose to get\n      circumcised. Participants in the control group will receive a soda but no food voucher if\n      they choose to get circumcised. The amounts for the intervention groups were selected based\n      on the approximate value of 3 days of work and average transportation costs within the\n      district. The amounts were also chosen so that they are not so large as to be perceived as\n      coercive.  Investigators selected food vouchers instead of cash or mobile phone credit\n      because the vouchers were deemed to be more acceptable given the sensitive nature of the\n      intervention and men's concern with feeding their families; it was also considered more\n      logistically feasible to offer vouchers at the health facilities rather than cash.\n      Additional focus group discussions will be held to verify that this form and amount of\n      compensation is acceptable and desirable in study communities and if necessary, the\n      intervention can be changed based on these results.\n\n      The food vouchers will be valid at dukas (shops) located within the district. At the\n      beginning of the study, these shops will be visited and informed about ways to receive cash\n      for the vouchers at the central IRDO office in Nyando District. IRDO has previously explored\n      the feasibility of implementing the voucher scheme and found that it can be implemented in\n      the study areas.\n\n      Three months after enrollment of study participants, investigators will conduct qualitative\n      research in which there will be in-depth interviews with a small sample of men who did and\n      did not come for circumcision and with their partners. Three topics will be examined in the\n      qualitative interview: men's decision-making, logistics of the intervention, and women's\n      perceptions."
