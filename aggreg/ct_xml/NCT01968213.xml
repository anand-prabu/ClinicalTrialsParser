  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled into this study will be stratified into 3 groups based on gene mutations
      identified in their tumor tissue.  The purpose of this study is to identify which of these
      groups of patients will most likely benefit from treatment with rucaparib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate
      [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated
      with homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency (HRD). Clinical data have shown
      that ovarian cancer patients with and without evidence of a gBRCA mutation benefit from
      treatment with a PARP and that maintenance treatment with a PARP inhibitor following a
      response to platinum-based treatment increases PFS in patients with ovarian cancer. While
      patients with a BRCA mutation derived the most benefit, patients without evidence of a BRCA
      mutation also derived significant benefit.

      Patients enrolled into this study will be stratified into 3 groups based on gene mutations
      identified in their tumor tissue. The purpose of this study is to identify which of these
      groups of patients will most likely benefit from treatment with rucaparib.  It is
      anticipated that rucaparib will provide therapeutic benefit and increase PFS in patients
      with HRD associated with a BRCA gene mutation or other HR gene alteration.
