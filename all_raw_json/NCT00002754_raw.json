Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of iodine-131-labeled\n      monoclonal antibody fragment ME1-14 F(ab')2 administered intracystically in patients with\n      recurrent or newly diagnosed primary or metastatic malignant melanoma or other brain tumors.\n      II. Identify any objective therapeutic responses to this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive a fixed dose of monoclonal antibody fragment ME1-14 F(ab')2\n      via an intralesional catheter; cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of isotope\n      conjugated to the antibody until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Patients with\n      newly diagnosed disease at entry may receive additional therapy with external-beam\n      radiotherapy beginning 4 months after radioimmunotherapy (or sooner if disease progression\n      occurs). Patients with recurrent disease at entry are followed without further therapy for\n      at least 4 months after radioimmunotherapy; alternative therapy may be offered upon\n      progression. All patients are followed at 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment, then every\n      12 weeks for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to six patients will be entered at each dose studied."
