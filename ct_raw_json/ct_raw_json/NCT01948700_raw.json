            "textblock": "Hispanic adolescents experience more severe alcohol-related consequences due to their\n      alcohol abuse and yet significantly fewer Hispanic adolescents receive alcohol treatment,\n      particularly among justice-involved youth.  Despite the level of research that has been\n      conducted on motivational interviewing (MI) with mainstream samples, no published studies\n      have investigated the efficacy of this brief, individual intervention with Hispanic\n      adolescents.  The overarching objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of a\n      brief individual intervention (MI) for problem drinking behaviors with a sample of\n      justice-involved Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents to determine if this intervention is\n      differentially effective between Hispanic and Caucasian adolescents.  Specifically, the\n      first aim is to determine whether an MI intervention targeting alcohol abuse is effective at\n      reducing alcohol use and related risk behavior in a sample of adolescent alcohol abusers.\n      The second aim is to examine whether the effects of MI on problem drinking outcomes (e.g.,\n      alcohol problems, quantity of drinking, frequency of binging) are different between Hispanic\n      versus Caucasian adolescents.  Because it is important to determine the mechanisms that\n      mediate the effects of MI and determine whether these mechanisms differ between Caucasian\n      and Hispanic adolescents, the third aim is to examine whether group (Hispanic vs. Caucasian)\n      moderates the mediational linkages in the overall model using a cross-groups approach to\n      moderated mediation.  To accomplish these aims, 453 Caucasian and Hispanic justice-involved\n      alcohol abusing adolescents (ages 14-17) will be randomized to either two 60 minute MI\n      interventions (one at baseline and a second, one week later) or an education condition.  All\n      adolescents will receive behavioral assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.  The\n      proposed research is expected to take a significant step towards reducing current\n      racial/ethnic health disparities in alcohol treatment for Hispanic adolescents."
