            "textblock": "Physical and psychological stress on Warfighters during training and operational missions\n      can suppress immune responsiveness.  Skin wound healing models can be used to detect changes\n      in immune function.  The goals of this research are to: 1) quantify the impact of an\n      operational stressor (i.e., sleep restriction) on suction blister immune response and skin\n      barrier restoration; and, 2) test the influence of nutrition intervention(s) on immune\n      response and skin barrier restoration consequent to an operational stressor.  Research will\n      be conducted in a laboratory environment using male and female Soldiers from the human\n      research participant detachment (NSRDEC), NSRDEC and/or USARIEM.  Recently, the\n      investigators lab assessed the test-retest reliability of a suction blister model by\n      creating eight suction blisters on participants' left and right forearms, and sampling\n      blister fluid and skin barrier restoration (12-06H), which will serve as one of the control\n      groups (Group 1, N = 15) for the study described herein.  Participants in the study\n      described herein (Groups 2-4, n = ~60) will be exposed to ~50 hours of sleep restriction ,\n      after which time eight suction blisters will be induced on one forearm and immune\n      responsiveness and skin barrier restoration time recorded.  Participants will receive no\n      nutrition intervention (Group 2), an immune-enhancing beverage and additional protein (1.2 g\n      protein per kg body weight versus 0.8 g protein per kg body weight) (Group 3) or probiotics\n      (Group 4), during and after sleep restriction to determine if nutritional approaches\n      attenuate the loss of immune responsiveness.  The results of this study will provide insight\n      into whether nutritional supplementation approaches confer immune recovery. The\n      investigators hypothesize that the suction blister immune response (during the 24 hours\n      following blister induction) and time to skin barrier restoration will degrade after an\n      imposed stress which includes~50 hours of wakefulness and constrained living; and, a diet\n      supplemented with either protein and a multi-nutrient nutritional supplement OR probiotics\n      will attenuate the decrements in suction blister immune responsiveness (during the 24 hours\n      following blister induction) and time to skin barrier restoration in response to ~50 hours\n      of sustained wakefulness and constrained living."
