A major challenge in the care of patients with IPF is determining prognosis.\n      The natural history of IPF is usually one of inexorable decline in lung function, ultimately\n      resulting in death from respiratory failure. However, longitudinal physiologic decline in\n      IPF is heterogeneous and difficult to predict in individual patients. While some patients\n      with IPF may remain stable for years, in others the disease may progress rapidly over a\n      relatively short time. We hypothesize that peripheral blood biomarkers based on\n      extracellular matrix and matrix-modifying molecules will improve prognostication in patients\n      with IPF."
