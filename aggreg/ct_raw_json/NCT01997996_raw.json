Due to a potential risk of de novo dyspareunia,\n      TVM are mainly used in postmenopausal women and in case of recurrent POP.  PROLIFT+M\n      (Trademark) is based on a highly flexible material which is partially absorbable. We suggest\n      that PROLIFT+M has less impact on the vita sexualis than conventional TVM and could also be\n      used for the treatment of younger and/or sexually active women. This study observes women\n      who are routinely treated with PROLIFT+M with regard to their sexual function before and\n      after the surgery. The hypothesis is that there is no worsening in vita sexualis with\n      PROLIFT+M."
