Importantly, individuals in this\n      study did not receive heart rate slowing agents (e.g., beta blockers), and diagnostic image\n      quality was substantially improved.  While not statistically powered on a per-patient basis,\n      per-segment diagnostic accuracy of CCTA using SSF was superior to conventional CCTA.  These\n      results are complementary to those derived from internal testing at GE Healthcare wherein\n      phantom work has demonstrated improved diagnostic performance using SSF compared to\n      conventional image acquisitions.\n\n      Long-term Goal/Purpose: To demonstrate the incremental utility of SSF for individuals\n      undergoing CCTA, with expected improvements in image quality and diagnostic accuracy.  If\n      the aims of this study are achieved, the use of SSF for effective temporal resolution\n      improvement may obviate (or reduce) the need for CT hardware for improved temporal\n      resolution."
