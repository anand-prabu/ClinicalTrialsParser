The\n                  FibroSURE[trademark]test can be performed and the results can be used to\n                  determine the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients with Child Pugh B or C\n                  cirrhotics are excluded\n\n             9. Ability to communicate effectively with the study investigator and other key\n             personnel.\n\n             10. Willingness to comply with the study restrictions and requirements.\n\n             11. Opioid-dependent individuals must be participating in a supervised treatment\n             program.\n\n             12. Subjects must have an external primary care doctor (outside of the Clinical\n             Center and the NIH) for their medical management.\n\n             13. Willingness to have blood or tissue samples stored for future use to study liver\n             disease and immune function.\n\n             14. Willingness to undergo HLA typing.\n\n             15. Otherwise healthy status as determined by medical history, physical examination,\n             electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory measurements performed at screening.\n\n        Contraception\n\n        The effects of ASV and DCV on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, men\n        and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception as outlined\n        in the inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to study entry and until 5 weeks (women )\n        and 14 weeks (men) after last dose of study medication. Hormonal contraception is NOT\n        considered an effective form of birth control for female subjects on this study. Oral\n        contraceptives are not as effective in women taking ASV and DCV so women cannot rely on\n        this form of birth control to prevent pregnancy. Females of childbearing-age must have a\n        negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving ASV and DCV. If a woman becomes pregnant\n        or suspects of being pregnant during the course of the study, she should inform the study\n        staff and her primary care physician immediately.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n          1.
