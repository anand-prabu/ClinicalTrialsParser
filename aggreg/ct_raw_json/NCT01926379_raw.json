The study is a two-arm cluster randomized trial, randomized at\n      the HIV clinic level, which includes 10 HIV clinics in Dire Dawa and Harar, Ethiopia.\n      Clinics are randomized to deliver the combination intervention package (CIP) or standard of\n      care (SOC), with stratification by facility size (<80 or >80 patients enrolled in HIV care\n      per year). The experimental intervention will be delivered to all patients in HIV clinics\n      randomly assigned to CIP who initiated HIV care at the CIP site on or after January 1, 2013\n      and initiated IPT on or after date of study initiation, July 1, 2013.  In HIV clinics\n      assigned to SOC, usual care procedures for provision of IPT will be delivered.\n\n      STUDY AIMS AND HYPOTHESES\n\n      Aim 1. Characterize and compare the effectiveness of a combination intervention package with\n      standard of care for IPT provision in Ethiopia.\n\n      Hypothesis 1.1: IPT initiation for new patients enrolling in HIV care at CIP clinics will be\n      higher than that for newly enrolled patients at SOC clinics.\n\n      Hypothesis 1.2: Adherence to and completion of IPT for participants initiating IPT at CIP\n      clinics will be higher than that for those initiating IPT at SOC clinics.\n\n      Aim 2. Assess the impact of CIP compared with SOC on HIV-related outcomes.\n\n      Hypothesis 2: HIV-related outcomes for participants receiving IPT at CIP clinics will be\n      superior to outcomes in participants receiving care at SOC clinics. HIV-related outcomes to\n      be assessed include retention in care and, among those participants receiving ART, adherence\n      to ART and CD4+ count.\n\n      Aim 3. Assess the safety and tolerability of IPT among HIV-infected individuals under\n      routine program conditions in Ethiopia.\n\n      Aim 4. Identify patient and program characteristics associated with IPT adherence and\n      completion at SOC sites.\n\n      Hypothesis 4.1: IPT adherence and completion will be associated with modifiable patient\n      characteristics, including ART status; knowledge and attitudes about IPT; and social\n      support.\n\n      Hypothesis 4.2: IPT adherence and completion will be associated with modifiable program\n      characteristics, including provider/patient ratio, patient tracking, and patient support\n      groups."

Routine clinic data from all HIV-infected patients enrolled in HIV care at the 10\n      participating clinics on or after January 1, 2013 will be used to measure the following\n      outcomes: IPT initiation, completion of IPT, and retention in HIV care.  These data will be\n      collected by Research Assistants (RA) by abstracting the following information from the\n      clinic Pre-ART, ART (antiretroviral therapy) and IPT registers during the period of\n      observation on all HIV patients who enrolled in care at a study site on or after January 1,\n      2013: date of enrollment in HIV care; IPT initiation (yes/no); date of ART initiation (if\n      applicable); IPT outcomes (completion, default, death, stopped, transferred out); TB\n      screening results; TB treatment (yes/no); TB treatment outcomes (if applicable); and\n      retention in HIV care.\n\n      A measurement cohort of 500 HIV-infected patients initiating IPT on or after July 1, 2013\n      will be recruited from the 10 clinics (n=250 per study arm).  MC participants will be\n      assessed at baseline (enrollment) and monthly intervals for six to nine months, depending on\n      the duration of IPT.  Outcomes to be measured among MC participants include: adherence to\n      IPT; adherence to ART (if applicable); change in CD4+ count; and side effects/adverse\n      events.  MC participants at both SOC and CIP sites will receive the same assessments.  RAs\n      will administer assessments on the day of regularly scheduled clinic visits, including a\n      Baseline interview administered on the day of enrollment (which coincides with the day the\n      participant initiates IPT), monthly follow-up interviews completed throughout IPT, and an\n      end of treatment interview that is completed on the day the participant ends IPT.\n      Participants who miss a study visit will be contacted by study staff and administered the\n      questionnaire over the phone within a 1-week window period of the scheduled clinic visit.\n      RAs will also call the MC participants between clinic visits to conduct unannounced pill\n      counts to assess medication adherence.  In addition, 30 MC participants from CIP sites will\n      participate in a qualitative interview to assess feasibility and acceptability of the\n      Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, one of the interventions in place at CIP sites.\n\n      RAs will conduct an assessment of programmatic activities at each HIV clinic prior to study\n      implementation and on a monthly basis thereafter throughout the study period.  Clinics in\n      both conditions will receive the same assessments.  The RA will administer a brief\n      semi-structured Program Characteristics survey to the ART nurse, who will be most familiar\n      with the day-to-day operations of the HIV clinic.  The survey will assess nurse training and\n      mentorship in IPT initiation and HIV treatment; availability and use of an IPT clinical\n      algorithm, IPT and ART adherence training for peer educators (PEs); IPT health education for\n      patients; availability and use of an IPT treatment literacy curriculum, including a\n      flipchart used by PEs; reimbursement for transportation costs for patients; provision of\n      mobile phones, SIM cards and airtime vouchers for HIV patients on IPT; use of IVR messages\n      for medication and appointment reminders and assessment of medication adherence and side\n      effects; and provision of community-based adherence and side effect monitoring by PEs.\n      These data will be used to assess fidelity with the intervention at CIP sites, as well as to\n      measure any potential contamination at SOC sites.\n\n      All clinical care will be performed by the clinic staff (nurses and PEs).  All study\n      procedures, including participant interviews, pill counts, medical record abstraction, and\n      program characteristics surveys will be performed by study staff (research assistants).\n      Following routine clinic visits, clinic staff will refer patients initiating IPT to study\n      staff, who will screen for eligibility, obtain informed consent, and enroll consenting\n      eligible patients into the MC.  In addition, RAs at CIP sites will provide parts of the\n      intervention, including disbursement of  mobile phones, SIM cards, airtime vouchers, and\n      cash for transportation reimbursement to eligible patients."
