            "textblock": "STUDY RATIONAL The education sector represents a reliable system for malaria control.\n      Intermittent preventive therapy in schoolchildren (IPTsc) is likely the most feasible and\n      appropriate chemoprevention in stable and endemic areas because schoolchildren are usually\n      asymptomatic to malaria infection and are consequently untreated in practice. Therefore, if\n      proven effective, IPTsc would be of direct benefit for the schoolchild, contribute to\n      malaria control at school, and facilitate community-wide the implementation of other control\n      interventions i.e. vector control, Intermittent preventive therapy in infants (IPTi), and\n      prompt diagnosis and treatment (PDT). Nevertheless, evidence about use of IPTsc is not yet\n      substantiated as only two clinical studies have so far been performed on IPTsc in hyper\n      endemic areas. Further clinical trials are warranted in other settings. Through a randomised\n      controlled trial (RCT) we will assess the efficacy and safety, of two IPT regimens versus\n      controls in school children of the DRCongo.\n\n      STUDY DRUGS Favourable drugs for use as IPT should balance long half-life against efficacy,\n      safety, tolerability and potentiality for cross-resistance selection.(16) Use of long-acting\n      drugs would result in fewer intake and higher treatment compliance.\n      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is an established used product in the indication of IPT in\n      pregnancy. The drug has further proven safety and tolerability in children in clinical\n      trials. SP is slowly eliminated and allows 60 days antimalaria protection for fully\n      sensitive P. falciparum. Other long-acting drugs available are mefloquine, amodiaquine, and\n      piperaquine. However, due safety concern mefloquine might not be optimal for IPT.\n      Amodiaquine is not suitable for IPT due to its 3 days treatment regimen that may be a\n      concern regarding compliance. Piperaquine has been extensively used for mass prophylaxis and\n      treatment since 1978 in China and other malaria endemic countries of Asia.(20) Piperaquine\n      has a long half-live and points as good IPT candidate in endemic country with SP resistance.\n      For this study sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combined with piperaquine (SP-PQ) plus will be\n      used. SP and SP-PQ will be given at 4 months intervals in line with the long half-lives\n      (around 20 days) in paediatric patients and for higher treatment compliance,"
