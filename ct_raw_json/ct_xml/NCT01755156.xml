  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MK-3102 compared to
      placebo in participants with inadequate glycemic control on metformin monotherapy. The
      primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the addition of treatment with MK-3102 provides
      greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) than placebo.
