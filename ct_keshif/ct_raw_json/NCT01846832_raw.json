PegIFN\u03b1-2a and RBV are commercially available therapies for HCV infection.\n      Participants will receive treatment with TMC435, PegIFN\u03b1-2a, and RBV for 12 weeks. If blood\n      levels of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) monitored at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 are below 25 IU/mL, all\n      treatment will be stopped at Week 12. If HCV RNA values are above 25 IU/mL at Weeks 2, 4, or\n      8, treatment with PegIFN\u03b1-2a and RBV will continue for an additional 12 weeks (up to Week\n      24) unless protocol-specified stopping criteria are met at Week 4 or 12, at which time all\n      treatment will be discontinued. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: a screening phase\n      of maximum 6 weeks, a treatment phase extending from Day 1 (baseline) up to 12 or 24 weeks\n      depending on the response to treatment, and a posttreatment follow-up period of 24 weeks\n      after the participant's last planned dose of study drug. The duration of the participation\n      (excluding screening phase) for each participant will vary between 36 and 48 weeks,\n      depending on the response to treatment. Blood samples for laboratory analysis will be\n      obtained from participants at protocol-specified time points during the study and\n      participant safety will be monitored throughout the study."
