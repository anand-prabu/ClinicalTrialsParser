      CTN-0051 will assess the comparative effectiveness of extended release injectable naltrexone
      (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®), an opioid antagonist recently approved and indicated for the prevention
      of relapse to opioid dependence, versus buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX, Suboxone®), a high
      affinity partial agonist indicated for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, as
      pharmacotherapeutic aids to recovery.

      The study will be conducted in approximately 8 NIDA Clinical Trials Network affiliated
      community based treatment programs.  Approximately 400 eligible participants will be
      randomized to treatment with XR-NTX or BUP-NX for 24 weeks.

      The primary goal of the study is to estimate the difference, if one exists, between XR-NTX
      and BUP-NX in the distribution of the time to relapse (i.e.., loss of persistent abstinence)
      during the 6-month trial.  Secondary objectives are to: (1) compare outcome on XR-NTX versus
      BUP-NX across a range of clinical safety and secondary efficacy domains, and (2) explore
      demographic and, clinical, and genetic predictors of successful treatment and moderators of
      differential effectiveness (i.e., what variables may help clinicians choose which of these
      treatments is best for a given patient).), and (3) collect a limited dataset to permit
      analyses of economic costs and benefits of the two treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For opioid-dependent patients in the U.S. and most of the rest of the world, detoxification
      or detoxification followed by short term residential treatment, with the goal of achieving
      long-term abstinence from opioid misuse is a mainstay of treatment.  Nonetheless, the
      majority of patients treated in this way will relapse to opioid misuse, leading to a costly
      and ineffectual cycle of readmission for repeated detoxifications.

      The overarching goal of CTN-0051 is to foster adoption of new relapse-prevention
      pharmacotherapies in community-based treatment programs (CTPs) where these could have a
      substantial public health impact.  To this end CTN-0051 will assess the comparative
      effectiveness of extended release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®), an opioid
      antagonist recently approved and indicated for the prevention of relapse to opioid
      dependence, versus buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX, Suboxone®), a high affinity partial
      agonist indicated for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, as pharmacotherapeutic
      aids to recovery.

      The study will be conducted in approximately 8 CTN-affiliated CTPs that provide
      detoxification services (inpatient/residential), have the capacity to maintain participants
      opioid-free for approximately 3-7 days, have the capacity to provide medication-assisted
      therapy, and can provide a minimum of one group or individual counseling session per week
      during the 24-week treatment period.  Approximately 400 eligible participants will be
      randomized to treatment with XR-NTX or BUP-NX for 24 weeks. To maximize generalizability,
      the point of randomization will be flexible, from shortly after program admission until just
      prior to program discharge. A study design modification (a shift to a later point of
      randomization) will occur if differential treatment initiation is a problem for cases
      randomized prior to completing detoxification (i.e., significantly fewer early randomizers
      are able to complete detoxification and XR-NTX induction).

      The primary goal of the study is to estimate the difference, if one exists, between XR-NTX
      and BUP-NX in the distribution of the time to relapse (i.e.., loss of persistent abstinence)
      during the 6-month trial.  The primary outcome measure will be the time to the event, with
      the event called relapse.  Secondary objectives are to: (1) compare outcome on XR-NTX versus
      BUP-NX across a range of clinical safety and secondary efficacy domains, and (2) explore
      demographic and, clinical, and genetic predictors of successful treatment and moderators of
      differential effectiveness (i.e., what variables may help clinicians choose which of these
      treatments is best for a given patient).), and (3) collect a limited dataset to permit
      analyses of economic costs and benefits of the two treatments.

      Toward the end of the 24-week treatment period, participants will be referred for follow-up
      care in the community (which could include pharmacotherapy if desired and available), and
      follow-up outcomes will be assessed at week 28 and week 36 after randomization.  For
      participants receiving BUP-NX, who do not wish to continue, or for whom community resources
      are not available, the study will provide a two-week BUP-NX taper (beginning at the week 24
      visit).

      In an ancillary genetics study we plan to study functional variants in three genes (OPRM1,
      OPRK1 and PDYN), known to affect the dynamic response to opioid receptor ligands.  These
      variants will be evaluated in CTN-0051 for their contribution to treatment retention,
      abstinence, and depression.  Blood collection for DNA extraction will occur at the same time
      that blood is collected for medical safety and liver function evaluation, precluding the
      need for an additional needle-stick.  Coded blood samples for the genetics studies will be
      sent to the NIDA Center for Genetics Repository.

    <time_frame>Days 0 - 10</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis: BUP-NX will produce higher rate of successful induction than XR-NTX
Significance/Rationale: XR-NTX induction requires completion of detoxification, whereas BUP-NX induction only requires onset of withdrawal symptoms. Thus XR-NTX may have more dropouts after randomization but prior to XR-NTX induction.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 0 - 279</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX and BUP-NX will produce equivalent rates of SAEs, and equivalent rates of AEs, though AE pattern will differ somewhat (e.g. injection site reactions with XR-NTX)
Significance/Rationale: Careful documentation of SAEs and AEs, including overdose episodes, would be considered essential safety data, and important component of a comparative effectiveness trial.</description>

    <measure>Opioid abstinence over time while on study medication (Weekly TLFB, confirmed by urine drug screens)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 195</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX will produce greater opioid abstinence than BUP-NX
Significance/Rationale: XR-NTX produces complete blockade of opioid effects, so that during treatment with monthly injections, opioid use can be expected to be minimal.  In contrast BUP-NX may not produce complete blockade, or patients may reduce or stop doses for a few days and substitute other opioids (heroin, prescription opioids).</description>

    <measure>Alcohol and other drug use, over time (TLFB and UDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 279</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX will be superior to BUP-NX in producing abstinence from alcohol and other drugs
Significance/Rationale: Clinical trials show XR-NTX is effective for treatment of alcohol dependence, and naltrexone has some evidence of efficacy for stimulant dependence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette smoking (FTND, Tobacco Use Questionnaire, VAS nicotine craving)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 279</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX will reduce cigarette smoking compared to BUP-NX
Significance/Rationale: Naltrexone has been studied as a treatment for nicotine dependence, with some support from clinical trials, although inconsistent.  Given high morbidity and mortality associated with nicotine dependence, a comparative advantage of one or the other of these treatments at reducing smoking would be valuable to examine.</description>

    <measure>Opioid Craving (VAS) over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 279</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX will be superior to BUP-NX in reducing opioid craving
Significance/Rationale: Krupitsky et al (Lancet 2011) pivotal XR-NTX trial showed, surprisingly, that XR-NTX reduced craving substantially compared to placebo.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subacute withdrawal symptoms over time (HAM-D, SOWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 279</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX will produce greater severity of subacute withdrawal symptoms than BUP-NX during the first month after randomization, but will be equivalent to BUP-NX in months 2 to 6
Significance/Rationale: Low-grade withdrawal-like symptoms (dubbed &quot;naltrexone flu&quot; by the Columbia group, and consisting typically of insomnia, fatigue, and anorexia, though not drug craving) have been observed in some patients in the 1 to 4 weeks after naltrexone initiation, resolving gradually.  Further characterization of this syndrome would be important for developing treatment guidelines.</description>

    <measure>Problems related to drug abuse  (ASI-Lite and EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 279</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX will be superior to BUP-NX
Significance/Rationale: Greater opioid and non-opioid abstinence on XR-NTX will result in fewer problems associated with active drug abuse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV risk behavior over time (RAB and other HIV risk measures)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 - 279</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX and BUP-NX will be equivalent
Significance/Rationale: The opioid-dependent population is at high risk for HIV, both from injection drug use and from unsafe sexual practices.  Effective treatment for the opioid dependence may reduce HIV risk behavior. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with HIV, a comparative advantage of one or the other of these treatments would be valuable to examine.</description>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Hypothesis:  XR-NTX and BUP-NX will be equivalent
Significance/Rationale:  Some providers and policy-makers are concerned that patients maintained on BUP-NX will have opioid-agonist-related cognitive impairment.</description>
