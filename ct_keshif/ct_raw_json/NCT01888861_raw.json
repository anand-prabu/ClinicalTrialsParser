In this double blind clinical trial, the\n      investigators examine effect of alfa-lipoic acid on those patients who admitted to intensive\n      care unit that the investigators expect to stay for more than 7 days in this ward and who\n      have tube feeding and don't have severe liver and kidney failure, AIDS and hepatitis. After\n      randomization of included patients by block randomization the investigators will give\n      900mg/day alfa-lipoic acid for ten days to treatment group and identical placebo to control\n      group by naso-gastric tube. The purposes of this study are decreasing ventilator dependency\n      period, length of stay in ICU, mortality and decelerate of organ failures."
