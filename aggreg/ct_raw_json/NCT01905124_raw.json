Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive CF101 1 mg or matching\n      placebo tablets in a 2:1 ratio orally every 12 hours for 24 weeks.\n\n      At the Screening Visit (performed within 4 weeks prior to Baseline), subjects who provide\n      written informed consent will have a complete medical history, medication history, physical\n      examination, weight, sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, electrocardiogram\n      (ECG), clinical laboratory tests, and ophthalmologic examination, including biomicroscopy\n      and grading of uveitis activity. For assessment of uveitis activity and response to\n      treatment, fundus photography will be obtained according to a standardized procedure and\n      interpreted at the Uveitis Photograph Reading Center.\n\n      Subjects who successfully qualify will begin dosing with CF101 1 mg or placebo, to be taken\n      orally every 12 hours for 24 weeks. At the Baseline Visit, a PBMC sample will be obtained\n      for assessment of A3AR expression level. Subjects will return for safety and efficacy\n      assessments and a new supply of study medication at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and for final\n      assessment and discharge at Week 24. A telephone call to each subject will be made at Week\n      26, for the purpose of collecting information on adverse events (AEs) and concomitant\n      medications.\n\n      During the course of the trial, concomitant use of intraocular or posterior subtenon\n      corticosteroids, intravitreal injections (including but not limited to steroids or\n      anti-vascular endothelial growth factors), systemic corticosteroids at a dose >20 mg/day\n      prednisone equivalent, or monoclonal antibody therapy is prohibited. Systemic corticosteroid\n      and immunosuppressive regimens must remain stable throughout the course of the trial."
