The children will be treated with ritonavir, nevirapine and stavudine or with\n      predefined drug substitutions in the case of intolerance.  Immunoreconstitution, defined as\n      the repopulation of naive T cells, will be studied by determining the presence and extent of\n      production of new naive (thymic derived) CD4+ T cells and their T cell receptor repertoire.\n      Drug pharmacokinetic profiles in this regimen will be examined."
