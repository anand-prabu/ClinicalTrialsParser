TEA optimizes pain relief while minimizing the use of systemic\n      opioids, thus reducing the duration of postoperative ileus. TEA also attenuates surgical\n      stress response and allows for early mobilization. Despite all the touted benefits of TEA,\n      much controversy limits its use for post surgical pain due to fear of exceedingly rare, if\n      not entirely theoretical complication of epidural hematoma.\n\n      Beneficial effects of TEA require that catheter placement and infusate be targeted at the\n      thoracic segments innervating injured skin, muscle, and bone from which pain input\n      originates.  The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of thoracic epidural\n      continuous catheter insertion by using fluoroscopic imaging."
