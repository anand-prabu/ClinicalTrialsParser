            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - An ongoing study is looking at American Indians who have kidney problems caused by type 2\n      diabetes. Kidney disease due to type 2 diabetes is a major problem in American Indians.  We\n      previously found that early treatment of kidney disease with losartan was probably\n      beneficial for reducing progression of the disease.  Researchers now want to see if these\n      benefits continue to be seen several years after the end of the treatment study.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study long-term benefit of losartan treatment for diabetic kidney disease in American\n      Indians with type 2 diabetes.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Participants in the American Indian diabetic kidney disease study (OH95-DK-N037).\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history before starting the study.\n           Blood and urine samples will be collected.\n\n        -  Participants will have a set of tests as part of this study. Those who have severe\n           kidney problems, such as kidney failure, will only have a basic kidney exam with scans.\n           The remaining participants will have a full urine collection and analysis. They will\n           also provide a kidney biopsy.\n\n        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study."

            "textblock": "The purpose of this protocol is to examine the long-term impact of treatment with the\n      angiotensin receptor blocker losartan on progression of diabetic kidney disease in American\n      Indians with type 2 diabetes. All participants were enrolled previously in a 6-year\n      randomized clinical trial under Protocol OH95-DK-N037.  Once randomized treatment was\n      completed, the subjects continued to be followed under that protocol with annual renal\n      clearance studies. Of the 170 participants originally enrolled in the trial, about 110\n      remain and they are eligible to enroll in this observational study.  The present protocol\n      replaces the clinical trial protocol and expands the scope of observational studies to be\n      conducted in these well-characterized patients.\n\n      Participants will continue to undergo annual renal clearance studies to measure glomerular\n      filtration rate and renal plasma flow, unless they have developed kidney failure. At the\n      initial visit, we will also conduct tests of the peripheral and autonomic nervous system to\n      determine the frequency and severity of diabetic neuropathy in this cohort and identify\n      linkages between diabetic kidney disease and diabetic neuropathy.  We will also perform a\n      kidney biopsy at the initial visit to examine the extent of structural changes that have\n      occurred since the last kidney biopsy done at the end of the clinical trial.  Tissue from\n      this biopsy will also be used for further gene expression and epigenetic studies. Data from\n      these studies will be used to guide the search for candidate biomarkers for diabetic\n      end-organ damage in serum and urine and to identify mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease\n      that may be amenable to new treatment strategies."

Prior to entry into the study, any subject with\n             hematuria should be evaluated, the etiology established and documented, and treatment\n             rendered as appropriate.\n\n          -  Chronic debilitating disorders with or without treatment (e.g., systemic lupus\n             erythematosus (SLE), cancer, amyloidosis, and chronic infection) that would interfere\n             with the assessment of kidney function or that might reduce the chances of survival\n             for a sufficient length of time to evaluate the efficacy of treatment.\n\n          -  Currently receiving a drug regimen that includes:  steroids, immunosuppressants, or\n             investigational new drugs.\n\n          -  Pregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior\n             to entry and prior to each renal clearance study.\n\n          -  Hypersensitivity to iodine.\n\n          -  Bleeding disorders, since kidney biopsies could not be performed safely in these\n             individuals.\n\n          -  Massive obesity with body mass index greater than or equal to 45 kg/m(2).  Kidney\n             biopsies are more difficult and present greater hazards to persons with massive\n             obesity.\n\n          -  Conditions likely to interfere with informed consent or compliance with the protocol."
