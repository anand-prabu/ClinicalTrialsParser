Phase B consisted of two 14-day treatment periods\n      separated by a washout period of 10 to 15 days. Subjects continued their usual phenytoin\n      scheme and received a single dose of ESL 1200 mg (Phase A) and either ESL (600 mg from Day 1\n      to 7 and 1200 mg from Day 8 to 14) or matching placebo once-daily for 14 days in each\n      period.\n\n      The study was prematurely terminated due to impossibility of recruiting the planned number\n      of patients. Only 4 patients were admitted and this was considered a too small sample size\n      to allow a reliable assessment of the potential interaction between ESL and phenytoin.\n      Therefore, no pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed."
