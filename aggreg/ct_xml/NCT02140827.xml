  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of colorectal disease. The success of
      colonoscopy depends on high-quality bowel preparation by patients. Inadequate bowel
      cleansing reduces the cecal intubation rate, and the polyp detection rate (PDR). It also
      increases costs, mostly due to repeated procedures. The quality of bowel cleansing has
      remained suboptimal even though numerous different products and regimens have been tested
      and compared in no fewer than six meta-analyses. Therefore, a completely different approach
      to improve bowel cleansing is welcome.

      Here the investigators assume that instant messaging program (Wechat) delivery the detail
      and FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) of bowel preparation instructions would improve the
      quality of the bowel preparation. The Wechat program has some advantages, 1. Wechat supports
      over 400 million users, nearly half of the mobile subscribers population in China; 2. Wechat
      provided a real time communications including voice messages, pictures and text exchange
      timely; 3.Compare with telephone, Wechat is economical of both time and money; 4. Compare
      with bowel preparation instructional software and litera or cartoon educational booklet,
      Wechat is more interactive and responsive.
