The approach to pain\n      management compresses routine pain assessments, utilizes both pharmacologic and\n      nonpharmacologic interventions, and requires ongoing reevaluation of the patient. Cancer\n      pain can be well controlled in the vast majority of patients if the algorithms of pain\n      control are systematically applied, carefully monitored, and tailored to the needs of the\n      individual patient.This study is aimed to assess the current pain managements in upper\n      gastrointestinal cancer patients in Taiwan. The effects of neuropathic pain and depression\n      on the enrolled patients would also be assessed."
