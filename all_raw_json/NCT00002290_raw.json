Efficacy will be\n      evaluated by monitoring the incidence, severity, and time of development of opportunistic\n      infections and other manifestations of advanced symptomatic HIV infection. The effects of\n      the combination and single AZT therapy on immune function and viral replication will also be\n      evaluated. Study participants will be monitored for evidence of toxicity or intolerance to\n      concurrent AZT / ACV administration and AZT therapy alone."
