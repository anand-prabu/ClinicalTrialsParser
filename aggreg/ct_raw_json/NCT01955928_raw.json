In this study participants are randomized to: 1) online cognitive-behavioral\n      2) waiting-list. Participants in the waiting-list condition receive treatment after the\n      post-test. The interventions consist of: diary; psycho-education; relaxation exercises;\n      stimulus control/sleep hygiene; sleep restriction; challenging the misconceptions about\n      sleep; and paradoxical exercise. Adult persons with insomnia will be invited via a popular\n      scientific website to fill out online questionnaires. Participants will fill out\n      questionnaires and a dairy at baseline post-test, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up.\n      In this study we are interested in sleep-related worry and daily complaints measured with a\n      diary. We expect that the online intervention ameliorates both the sleep-related worry and\n      the daily complaints. Furthermore, we expect that the sleep related worry mediates the\n      effect of the intervention on sleep- and daily complaints."
