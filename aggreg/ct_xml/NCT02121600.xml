      Evaluate the ability of 18F-FCH PET/MRI scan to detect pre-treatment tumor burden and assess
      response to treatment in men with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

      It is hypothesized that these novel biomarkers will better identify evaluable lesions prior
      to therapy and identify response to treatment (or lack thereof) earlier in the treatment
      period, providing a better guide for treating men with CRPC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) occurs when prostate cancer no longer responds to
      androgen deprivation therapy. Eventually all men diagnosed with CRPC will succumb to their
      disease.  While many new therapies have been introduced, there are limitations in assessing
      treatment response and physicians are faced with a challenge when creating a management
      strategy for men with CRPC.

      Most men present with bone metastases, and accurate quantification of disease burden can be
      difficult due to the nature of conventional scans such as CT and bone scan. In addition, the
      standard blood PSA measurement does not always reflect a clinical response, or may lag to
      show this response. There is a clear need for better imaging and blood biomarkers to measure
      disease in men with CRPC.

      This study will explore the benefit of a 18F-FCH Hybrid PET/MRI scan, Cancer Microparticle
      (CMP) and Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) measurements compared to standard imaging and PSA
      levels.

      In this study, patients will receive a 18F-FCH PET/MRI or 18F-FCH PET/CT scan + whole body
      MRI at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Serial CMP and CTC blood samples will be
      taken at 5 study timepoints.

      66 patients will be enrolled at 3 cancer centres in Ontario. Patients will be divided into 2
      cohorts based on the type of treatment they will receive: Docetaxel or Abiraterone.

      It is hypothesized that these novel biomarkers will better identify evaluable lesions prior
      to therapy and identify response to treatment (or lack thereof) earlier in the treatment
      period thus providing a better guide for treating men with CRPC.
