Dizziness and balance problems have an incidence of 30-80% in this\n      population.\n\n      Studies show that dizziness and imbalance has the potential to restrict several aspects of\n      personal and social life.\n\n      Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is an accepted and effective treatment for dizziness and\n      imbalance.  However there is lack of evidence/knowledge about its effect on TBI patients.\n\n      The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial study (RCT). Patients aged 16-60\n      admitted to Oslo University Hospital with TBI and symptoms of dizziness and imbalance are\n      included 8 weeks after the injury.\n\n      The intervention and control group will receive multidisciplinary assessment and evaluation.\n      The intervention group will in addition receive group training and a home exercise program\n      by physiotherapists. The intervention will consist of a individually adapted Vestibular\n      Rehabilitation and balance program.\n\n      The main outcome measurement is the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). The study has\n      several other self-report and performance based outcome measures. The outcome measures will\n      be performed before and after the intervention and 6 months after the injury."
