  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus (oral form), to
      decrease the volume and symptoms due to superficial arteriovenous malformations (AVM).

      Sirolimus has properties that reduce the activity of the immune system (immunosuppressant),
      to fight against the proliferation of cancer cells (anti- tumor) and also reduce the
      proliferation of blood vessels (anti -vascular). Sirolimus is primarily used in transplant
      patients to prevent organ transplant rejection. Many animal and laboratory studies were
      carried out and demonstrate in particular the activity of sirolimus on vessels. It is this
      anti- vascular effect that could help treat arteriovenous malformations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties of Sirolimus (Rapamycin®) are the basis of
      the rationale to use it in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations, for which the
      pathophysiology remains poorly understood. The interest of this class of drug is that
      inhibition of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) may also block growth and / or angiogenic
      factors (other than VEGF) involved in the development of AVM. More specifically anti-VEGF
      drugs does not have that potential.

    <description>The efficacy of treatment is a composite criteria based on:
The proportion of patients with no evolution of the AVM during the study period,
The proportion of patients with a reduction in tumor volume of the AVM at least 30% of CT Angiography (CTA) criteria during the first year of the study (comparison of the volume of the AVM a year versus pre-inclusion).</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed before and at the end of the first year of treatment using a questionnaire given to patients. There is no questionnaire specifically tailored to vascular malformations in the literature. Thus the investigators adapted a document based on an evaluation of the quality of life for survivors of burn injury.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive sirolimus (Rapamune). The dose should be adjusted to obtain a residual plasma rate of 8 to 12 ng/ml in 4 weeks. This serum level will be maintained throughout the duration of the study in the absence of side effects. In case of intolerance that do not justify the discontinuation of treatment, the dose may be reduced by maintaining a serum level greater than 3 ng/ml.
The starting dose will be 2 mg per day, and will be adapted every week for one month.
The preferred dosage form is tablet form. To prevent common side effects in early treatment, corticosteroids based prednisolone (SOLUPRED) will be established at a dose of 0.5 mg/ kg/day for the first week of treatment.</description>
