            "textblock": "Despite the considerable efforts of the DoD and VA to improve awareness of mental health\n      problems and access to care, many returning veterans still report substantial barriers to\n      seeking traditional mental health care.   Research suggests that a significant barrier to\n      pursuing treatment is the perception of stigma (Hoge at al., 2004).  The primary objective\n      of this 12-week pilot, randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to obtain pilot data on the\n      utilization and efficacy of a standardized, integrative exercise protocol (aerobic exercise\n      and mindful breath training) in addressing global post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n      symptoms, sleep disturbances, and non-sleep PTSD symptoms in veterans with PTSD.\n      Specifically, this study will examine whether a 12-week course of Integrative Exercise\n      therapy, a treatment lacking stigma, 1) produces significant pre-post improvements in PTSD\n      symptoms and sleep disturbances (compared to a Monitor Only Waitlist condition) 2) improves\n      other clinical outcomes including mood, alcohol and non-alcohol substance use, psychological\n      distress, mindfulness, and overall quality of life (compared to a Monitor Only Waitlist\n      condition) and 3) whether such treatment is feasible and acceptable.\n\n      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate possible mechanisms underlying these effects\n      such as chemicals in the blood related to stress, changes in brain imaging markers, aerobic\n      capacity, and improved sleep."
