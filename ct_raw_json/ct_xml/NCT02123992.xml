        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject is female

        Subject is at least 18 years of age

        Subject must have documented diagnosis of posterior or posterior and apical vaginal
        prolapse with leading edge of pelvic organ prolapse at or beyond the hymen.  At or beyond
        the hymen is defined as POP-Q scores of Bp ≥ 0; or Bp ≥ 0 and C ≥ -1/2 TVL (for a
        multi-compartment posterior prolapse that includes the apical compartment)

        Subject reports a bothersome bulge they can see or feel per PFDI-20, question 3, response
        of 2 or higher (i.e., responses of &quot;somewhat&quot;, &quot;moderately&quot;, or &quot;quite a bit&quot;)

        Subject or subject's legally authorized representative is willing to provide written
        informed consent

        Subject is willing and able to comply with the follow-up regimen

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject is pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the study

        Subject has an active or chronic systemic infection including any gynecologic infection,
        untreated urinary tract infection (UTI) or tissue necrosis

        Subject has history of pelvic organ cancer (e.g. uterine, ovarian, bladder, or cervical)

        Subject has had prior or is currently undergoing radiation, laser therapy, or chemotherapy
        in the pelvic area

        Subject has taken systemic steroids (within the last month), or immunosuppressive or
        immunomodulatory treatment (within the last 3 months)

        Subject has systemic connective tissue disease (e.g. scleroderma, systemic lupus
        erythematosus (SLE), Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers Danhlos, collagenosis, polymyositis or
        polymyalgia rheumatica)

        Subject has chronic systemic pain that includes the pelvic area or chronic focal pain that
        involves the pelvis

        Subject has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM)

        Subject has a known neurologic or medical condition affecting bladder function (e.g.,
        multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or stroke with residual neurologic deficit)

        Subject is seeking obliterative vaginal surgery as treatment for pelvic organ prolapse
        (colpocleisis)

        Subject is not able to conform to the modified dorsal lithotomy position

        Subject is currently participating in or plans to participate in another device or drug
        study during this study

        Subject has a known sensitivity to polypropylene

        Subject has had previous prolapse repair with mesh in the target compartment

        Subject is planning to undergo a concomitant repair with use of mesh in the non-target
        compartment
