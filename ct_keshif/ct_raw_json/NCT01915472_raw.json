            "textblock": "This is a Phase II trial to study the safety and efficacy of IMMU-130. IMMU-130 is composed\n      of a drug attached to an antibody. The drug is the active ingredient in irinotecan which is\n      a common chemotherapy drug used for colorectal cancer. Antibodies are proteins normally made\n      by the immune system. They bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm\n      to the body. The antibody in this study was designed to bind to a marker located on\n      colorectal cancer tumors. The antibody was originally made from mouse proteins, but was\n      changed in the laboratory to be more like human antibodies. This study will investigate how\n      IMMU-130 acts for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The study is mainly being done to see\n      if IMMU-130 is safe and effective."
