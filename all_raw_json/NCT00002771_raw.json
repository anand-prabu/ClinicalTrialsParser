Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may\n      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of various combination\n      chemotherapy regimens or bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with chronic\n      myelogenous leukemia."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, eligibility for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (Allo-BMT) (yes\n      vs no), donor availability (sibling vs unrelated vs none), and risk status (high vs low).\n\n      Induction therapy\n\n        -  Patients receive induction therapy comprising oral hydroxyurea (HU) until WBC falls\n           below 10,000/mm^3 and interferon alfa (IFN-A) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning after\n           WBC reduction and continuing in order to maintain WBC between 2,000-4,000/mm^3 and\n           platelet count greater than 50,000/mm^3. If WBC is 10,000/mm^3 or greater on IFN-A\n           alone, then HU must be restarted. Patients with disease progression and no anti-IFN\n           antibody also receive cytarabine (ARA-C) SC for 15 days a months. Patients who develop\n           disease progression while receiving ARA-C and IFN-A are taken off study.\n\n        -  Patients who are eligible for Allo-BMT, have a sibling donor, and are age 55 and under\n           receive induction therapy for a maximum of 1 year and then proceed to regimen B.\n           Patients who are eligible for Allo-BMT, have an unrelated donor, and are age 45 and\n           under receive induction therapy for 12-18 months. Those patients with cytogenetic\n           remission receive induction therapy for up to 2 years and then proceed to regimen B.\n           Those patients without cytogenetic remission proceed directly to regimen B. Patients\n           who are ineligible for Allo-BMT, but are eligible for autologous BMT (AuBMT) or\n           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) receive induction therapy for a\n           maximum of 1 year and then proceed to regimen C. Patients who are ineligible for\n           Allo-BMT and achieve hematologic complete remission (CR) within 3 months receive\n           induction therapy for 18 months. Those patients with cytogenetic remission proceed\n           directly to regimen A. Those patients without cytogenetic remission proceed to\n           randomization on regimen B. Patients who are ineligible for Allo-BMT and fail to\n           achieve hematologic CR within 9 months proceed to randomization on regimen B. All other\n           patients who are ineligible for Allo-BMT receive induction therapy for 1 year. Those\n           patients with cytogenetic remission proceed to regimen A. Those patients without\n           cytogenetic remission proceed to randomization on regimen B.\n\n      Consolidation/maintenance therapy\n\n        -  Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 regimens.\n\n        -  Regimen A: Patients continue to receive IFN-A as in induction therapy in the absence of\n           disease progression.\n\n        -  Regimen B: Patients receive conditioning therapy comprising busulfan for 4 days and/or\n           total body irradiation, followed by Allo-BMT. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2\n           treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising HU and IFN-A as in\n                induction therapy.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive consolidation therapy comprising ARA-C SC every 12 hours\n                on days 1-5 and idarubicin (IDA) IV on days 3 and 4 (and day 5 for patients with\n                responding disease). Consolidation therapy continues every 2 months for a total of\n                3 courses. When blood counts recover, patients receive maintenance therapy\n                comprising IFN-A and ARA-C (if needed) as in induction therapy.\n\n        -  Regimen C: Patients receive IDA and ARA-C as in arm II. Patients then undergo AuBMT or\n           PBSCT.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3-6 months for at least 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 750 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
