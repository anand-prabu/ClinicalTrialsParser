            "textblock": "There is increasing evidence that chronic sleep disorders in children with autism spectrum\n      disorder (ASD), Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) are associated with\n      disturbed melatonin secretion and melatonin administration has been shown to be effective in\n      these populations.  For children who have difficulties swallowing a tablet, Neurim has\n      developed an age-appropriate Melatonin formulation in the form of mini-tablets which have\n      the same dissolution profile as the Circadin\u00ae tablets product, thus should produce the same\n      melatonin concentration-time profile with the same effects.  This study concerns the\n      pharmacokinetic study.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to :\n\n        -  Establish the 24 hour baseline profile of endogenous saliva melatonin concentrations\n           and urine 6-SMT excretion in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with\n           neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.\n\n        -  Establish the concentration-time profile of saliva melatonin concentrations and 24 hour\n           6-SMT urine excretion after 2 and 10 mg Circadin\u00ae mini-tablets single dose\n           administration in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental\n           disorders with sleep disturbances.\n\n        -  Evaluate the adverse event profile after a single dose of 2 or 10 mg Circadin\u00ae\n           mini-tablets in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental\n           disorders with sleep disturbances."
