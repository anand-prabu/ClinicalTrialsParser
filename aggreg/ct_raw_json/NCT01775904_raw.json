Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.\n      Each participant may be involved in the study for approximately 7 weeks.\n\n      This study requires 4 periods. In each period, participants will receive LY2886721 as a\n      tablet or capsule, with or without food and water.  There is a 7 day washout between each\n      period."
