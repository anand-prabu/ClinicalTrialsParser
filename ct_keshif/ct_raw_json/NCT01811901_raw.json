This delay can be dissected into\n      onset-to-door time and door-to-needle time (DNT). Of the two, DNT can be directly influenced\n      within the hospital by stream-lining of acute stroke care. The aim of our study is to reduce\n      in-hospital delays (DNT) in self-selecting centers recruiting patients into the the  Safe\n      Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register\n      (SITS-ISTR) , comprising currently more than 80 000 patients from 1338 centers. Current\n      median of DNT in all SITS centers is 65 minutes (compared with 20 minutes in Helsinki\n      Univer-sity Central Hospital). An itemized detailed questionnaire, including all factors\n      known to influence DNT, has been sent to all SITS centers to identify the reasons for long\n      in-hospital delays. Based on the replies, we have prepared a list of interventions that can\n      be considered by individual SITS centers in order to reduce DNT with interventions that are\n      in line with national legislation."
