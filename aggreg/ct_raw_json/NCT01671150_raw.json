            "textblock": "Depressive disorders occur at a high rate in patients with inflammatory disorders, with a\n      point prevalence of 15-29%, which is two to three times greater than that observed in the\n      general population. Substantial evidence has shown that inflammation and increases in\n      proinflammatory cytokine activity play a critical role in the onset and perpetuation of\n      depression and depressive symptoms (e.g. insomnia, fatigue) in those who are co-morbid for\n      inflammatory disorders. Consistent with this, experimental work has shown that an\n      inflammatory challenge can increase depressed mood in an otherwise healthy sample. Based on\n      these findings, there has been a growing interest in whether inflammatory processes can\n      contribute to depression in a causal manner and how these effects might occur.\n\n      Given the observation that inflammatory processes trigger social withdrawal, coupled with\n      evidence that feelings of 'social disconnection' play a critical role in the onset and\n      perpetuation of (non-inflammatory forms of) depression, it is surprising that the social\n      psychological consequences of inflammation and their contribution to depression have not\n      been more fully explored. Here, we suggest that inflammation may increase feelings of social\n      disconnection and that these social psychological changes may be an important contributor to\n      inflammation-associated depression. Indeed, preliminary data demonstrated that an\n      experimentally-induced inflammatory challenge (endotoxin) led to increases in self-reported\n      feelings of social disconnection (e.g., \"I feel disconnected from others\") in addition to\n      increases in depressed mood. Aside from these findings, however, there are no studies that\n      have explored the effect of inflammatory processes on social experience in humans. The\n      over-arching objective of this proposal is to explore the experiential and neural correlates\n      of inflammatory-induced changes in social experience (e.g., feelings of social\n      disconnection), which may provide a critical missing link in understanding the relationship\n      between inflammation and depression.\n\n      Participants (n=100) will be randomly assigned to receive either endotoxin or placebo and\n      will then be monitored for the next six hours. Blood draws to assess cytokine levels as well\n      as self-reported feelings of social disconnection and depressed mood will be collected\n      hourly. In addition, at the time of peak cytokine response, participants will complete a\n      neuroimaging session to examine the effect of inflammatory challenge on neural sensitivity\n      to social rejection and social acceptance. It is hypothesized that endotoxin will increase\n      feelings of social disconnection over time, and that the underlying neural sensitivities\n      that give rise to these feelings (e.g., increased neural sensitivity to social rejection;\n      decreased neural sensitivity to social acceptance) will contribute to inflammatory-induced\n      depressed mood."

Any participant who has any of the following\n        conditions will be ineligible for the study: Medical conditions. (1) presence of co-morbid\n        medical conditions not limited to but including cardiovascular (e.g., history of acute\n        coronary event, stroke) and neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease), as well as\n        pain disorders; (2) presence of co-morbid inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid\n        arthritis or other autoimmune disorders; (3) presence of an uncontrolled medical condition\n        that is deemed by the investigators to interfere with the proposed study procedures, or to\n        put the study participant at undue risk; (4) presence of chronic infection, which may\n        elevate proinflammatory cytokines; (5) presence of an acute infectious illness in the two\n        weeks prior to an experimental session. Psychiatric Disorders. (6) current and/or lifetime\n        history of a major Depressive Disorder or other DSM-IV psychiatric disorder (e.g.\n        substance dependence) due to the known effects of major depression and/or substance\n        dependence on inflammation. (Absence of a psychiatric diagnosis will be based on a\n        structured psychiatric interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnosis:\n        SCID; First et al., 1996).) Medication and substance use. (7) current and/or past regular\n        use of hormone-containing medications including steroids; (8) current and/or past regular\n        use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs; (9) current and/or past regular use of immune\n        modifying drugs that target specific immune responses such as TNF antagonists; (10)\n        current and/or past regular use of analgesics such as opioids; (11) current and/or past\n        regular use of psychotropic medications, including selective serotinergic reuptake\n        inhibitors, antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives and barbiturates. Health\n        factors. (12) current smokers or excessive caffeine users (>600 mg/day) because of known\n        effects on proinflammatory cytokine levels; (13) body mass index (BMI) greater than 35,\n        (14) shows evidence of drug use from a positive urine test, (15) has a positive pregnancy\n        test, if female, or (16) shows any abnormalities on screening laboratory tests."
