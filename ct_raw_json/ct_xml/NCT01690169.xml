    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of single
      doses of NNC0113-0987 in healthy male subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects with good general health as judged by the investigator, based on
             medical history, physical examination including 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG),
             vital signs, and blood assessments at the screening visit

          -  Body mass index (BMI) above or equal to 18.5 and below 30 kg/m^ 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects who are sexually active and not surgically sterilised, who or whose
             partner is unwilling to use two different forms of effective contraception, one of

             for the duration of the trial and for 12 weeks following the last dose of trial
             medication

          -  Participation in another trial within 90 days prior to screening

          -  Subjects with a history of or presence of cancer, diabetes, or any clinically

             psychiatric disease or other major disorders that might have an impact on the current
             trial, as judged by the investigator
