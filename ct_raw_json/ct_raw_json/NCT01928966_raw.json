Pumpkin seeds are a good source of monounsaturated and\n      polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oil extracted from pumpkin seeds has been shown to lower blood\n      pressure. One purpose of this study is to determine whether eating 1.5 ounces of pumpkin\n      seeds per day will improve polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acid intake in the diet\n      in healthy adult women. Another purpose of this study is to determine whether eating 1.5\n      ounces of pumpkin seeds a day will lower blood pressure."
