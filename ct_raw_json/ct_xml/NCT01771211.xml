  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive electrical brain stimulation can
      improve word-retrieval in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) can have
      beneficial effects on word-retrieval in healthy younger and older subjects. The present
      study aims to extend these findings by assessing whether atDCS can also improve known
      impairments of word-retrieval in Mild Cognitive Impairment. atDCS will be applied to the
      left inferior frontal gyrus in a sham controlled cross-over within subjects design.
      Simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will assess underlying neural
      effects of the stimulation.

    <description>Subjects are assessed in a cross-over design. The primary outcome measure will be assessed twice in each subject, either during sham stimulation or active stimulation with transcranial direct current stimulation. Order of stimulation (sham, atDCS or atDCS, sham) will be counterbalanced across the group. The study design has been described in detail before (Meinzer et al., 2012, Journal of Neuroscience, 32:1859 -1866).</description>

    <description>anodal tDCS will be delivered with a constant current of 1 mA during resting-state and task-related fMRI and will continue until the end of the word-generation task. For both stimulation conditions (atDCS, sham) the current will be initially increased in a ramp-like fashion over 10 s, eliciting a tingling sensation on the scalp that fades over seconds. During sham stimulation the current will be turned off after 30 s.</description>
