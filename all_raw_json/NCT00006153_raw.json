A vaccine called Remune works to stop the virus infection by\n      \"boosting\" the body's immune cell defense against the HIV virus before the virus enters\n      cells. It also blocks the virus from entering the cells. This study will see whether Remune\n      will improve the immune cell natural defense in patients who are also taking anti-HIV drugs."

            "textblock": "During primary HIV infection, after an initial burst in viral load, the body mounts an\n      immunologic response to viral antigens. It is thought that this initial immune response\n      plays an important role in determining early and long-term suppression of HIV. However,\n      limited information is available regarding the effect of early antiretroviral therapy on\n      immune responses. Therapeutic approaches such as Remune, which augment cell-mediated\n      immunologic responses, may prove to be beneficial in controlling the progression of HIV\n      infection, especially when used in combination with antiretroviral therapy in early\n      infection. Current antiviral drugs work by inhibiting the infection of new cells yet seem to\n      suppress early cell-mediated immune responses. The question is raised as to whether\n      immune-based therapies such as Remune may counteract the suppressive effects of\n      antiretrovirals and slow the progression of infection.\n\n      Patients receiving fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy are randomized to add either\n      Remune or an Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) control. Vaccinations are administered on\n      Day 1, Week 12, and Week 24. Blood samples are collected at Day 1 and Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24,\n      and 28.  Clinical assessment includes lymphocyte proliferative response, cytotoxic T\n      lymphocyte (CTL) memory cell activity, chemokine and cytokine measurements, CD4 count, and\n      viral load. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin tests are performed at Day 1 and Week\n      28.  HIV-1 specific immunogenicity is coordinated with the response to antiretroviral\n      therapy in patients."
