  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the feasibility of collecting plasma samples for
      cardiac biomarker assessment, and to identify if there is an associations between the
      biomarkers, echocardiographic features and the cardiac PET scan results (in patients
      receiving radiation therapy). This is the first step in a research program that has an
      overall goal of being able to predict early-treatment induced cardiotoxicity in patients
      with breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Stage I-III, HER2-neu positive invasive ductal carcinoma

          2. Scheduled to receive adjuvant/neo-adjuvant 5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin,
             Cyclophosphamide and Docetaxel (FEC-D) chemotherapy

          3. Scheduled to receive adjuvant Trastuzumab

          4. ECOG Performance status 0-2

          5. Adequate baseline imaging on transthoracic echocardiography, and baseline cardiac
             ejection fraction of ≥ 55%.  Additionally, breast cancer patients≥45 years of age and
             scheduled to receive whole breast radiation therapy will receive two cardiac PET
             scans.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior anthracycline chemotherapy

          2. History of dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery
             disease

          3. Life expectancy less than 15 months

          4. Pregnant or lactating women

          5. Use of beta receptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin converting
             enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor inhibitors at baseline.

          6. Previous chest wall/breast or nodal radiation.
