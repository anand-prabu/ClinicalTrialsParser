Prevalence depends on patient's ethnic group and is about 6 to 14%. This prevalence\n      is increasing due to increased GD risk factors (obesity, pregnancy over 35) and also because\n      criteria of screening have been strengthened after the results of last studies. Usual\n      treatment is diet and in case of failure insulin therapy with multiple injections which may\n      lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain and is very difficult to manage for patients. Some\n      studies have shown the comparable effect of metformin and insulin in about 50% of GD obese\n      patients. The aim of our study is to evaluate efficacy of metformin, outcomes in mother and\n      fetus and baby of metformin. In case of metformin failure, insulin will be added in order to\n      obtain glycaemia in desired goals.Oxidative stress will be assessed in mother blood, baby\n      umbilical cord blood, baby umbilical cord and placenta in 90 women and the oxidative stress\n      compared between insulin and metformin alone treated patients."
