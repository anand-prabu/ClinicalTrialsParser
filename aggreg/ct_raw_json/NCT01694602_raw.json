The approach is based on: 1) the known increase in de novo production of\n      3-methylhistidine (3MH) from muscle protein breakdown in said patients as a consequence of\n      their unique disease-host interactions, and 2) earlier demonstration that de novo 3MH\n      production can be measured in vivo using isotope dilution.\n\n      During this Phase-II project, we propose to conduct a statistically powerful prospective\n      investigation to demonstrate that measurement of the slope of the terminal decay curve (rate\n      constant) with our approach in newly diagnosed cancer patients predicts future development\n      of muscle wasting.  We expect the outcome of the combined Phase-I and Phase-II research to\n      lead to the early identification of elevated muscle catabolism in at-risk patients so that\n      medical intervention can prevent future muscle atrophy."
