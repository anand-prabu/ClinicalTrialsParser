  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to increase our knowledge about the effect of physical activity in
      patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. The study will provide novel information
      in two areas. The main objective is to study the effect of physical activity on the weight
      loss and cardiovascular risk factors. This will be accomplished in a randomized clinical
      trial in patients, who are eligible for gastric bypass (GB). Patients will be randomized to
      six month of structured physical activity or standard postoperative counseling. The study
      will include an exhaustive panel of blood tests related to cardiovascular risk and the most
      extensive evaluation of structural and functional vascular test done in this patient group
      so far. In addition the study will provide information of the effect of bariatric surgery
      per se since both pre- and postoperative investigations are conducted. The study will learn
      us to what degree it is possible to motivate this group of patients to increased physical
      activity. All together this will enable us to improve the counseling of the patients
      undergoing GB.

    <description>The intervention program will continue for six month consisting of two weekly sessions of 40 min exercise supervised by physiotherapists. The supervised exercise program will take place at the training center Fitness.dk in Esbjerg and Kolding. It will be in cooperation with physiotherapists at the Therapy Department of Sydvestjysk Sygehus Esbjerg and the Therapy Department of Fredericia and Kolding Sygehus, Sygehus Lillebælt. The exercise program at the two centers will be equal.  In addition the patients will be provided with free access to a fitness center. The patient will be encouraged to do at least 3.5 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week.</description>
