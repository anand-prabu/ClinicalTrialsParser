Fasiglifam is being\n      tested to treat people who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and are currently taking\n      sitagliptin (with or without metformin). This study will evaluate glycemic control in people\n      who take fasiglifam plus sitagliptin compared with placebo plus sitagliptin.\n\n      The study will enroll approximately 390 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by\n      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups\u2014which will remain\n      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent\n      medical need; all participants will be on 100 mg sitagliptin and may or may not be on\n      metformin background treatment):\n\n        -  fasiglifam 25 mg\n\n        -  fasiglifam 50 mg\n\n        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has\n           no active ingredient All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time\n           each day throughout the study.\n\n      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in North America and Latin America. The overall\n      time to participate in this study is approximately 38 weeks. Participants will make 15\n      visits to the clinic.\n\n      Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients\n      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.\n\n      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for\n      fasiglifam."
