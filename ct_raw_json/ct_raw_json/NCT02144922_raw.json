However, the measurement of CFR has\n      rarely been performed in hypertensive patients without CAD, because CFR could be invasively\n      measured using a Doppler guide wire in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Recent advances\n      in echocardiographic imaging techniques have made it possible to measure coronary flow\n      velocity and CFR, which highly correlates with the CFR measured by invasive means.\n\n      Lipid lowering with a statin provided beneficial effects in patients with average levels of\n      serum total cholesterol in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm\n      (ASCOT-LLA) study conducted in hypertensive patients at cardiovascular risk. Improvements in\n      endothelial dysfunction and CFR may be related to the beneficial effects of statins in\n      hypertensive patients without hypercholesterolemia, but the effect of statins on CFR has not\n      been examined in such patients. Accordingly, the investigators try to examine the hypothesis\n      that pitavastatin added to standard antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive patients with\n      cardiovascular risk will be superior to placebo in improving CFR  in a double-blind,\n      randomized comparison study using Doppler echocardiography."
