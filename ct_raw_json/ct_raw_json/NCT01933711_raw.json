Pts with\n      aggressive lymphoma with residual tumor mass underwent positron emission tomography (PET)\n      and qualified for randomization if this examination showed no signs of tumor activity. Pts\n      with mantle cell lymphoma were eligible for the study if at least a partial response (PR)\n      was achieved. Primary endpoint of the study was progression free survival (PFS), secondary\n      endpoints were time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and response to treatment.\n      Differences between PFS and OS were analysed using the logrank test and the proportional\n      hazard model of Cox.
