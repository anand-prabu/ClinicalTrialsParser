  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of two types of in-shoe custom
      made orthotics in altering the motion of the foot and muscle activity of select muscles of
      the lower leg in individuals experiencing lower extremity symptoms of a non traumatic
      origin.  We hypothesized that orthotics would decrease the extent of motion of the during
      walking and running when compared to a barefoot condition.  We further hypothesized that
      orthotics would decrease the amount of muscle activity seen during walking and running when
      compared to barefoot walking.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have complaints of lower extremity or foot pain of a non-traumatic,
             mechanical origin.

          -  Subjects must have at least 60 degrees of frontal plane forefoot on rearfoot passive
             range of motion (as determined by a modified Gib test in the symptomatic lower
             extremity.

          -  Subjects must be able to walk independently on a treadmill at a speed of 4.8 kmh.

          -  Subjects must have been referred by a health care professional for an orthosis
             fitting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects having less than 60 degrees of forefoot on rearfoot frontal plane passive
             range of motion.

          -  Subjects having a history of a fracture of the foot or ankle.

          -  Subjects having any previous illness, surgery or other characteristic (e.g.,
             cardiovascular, musculoskeletal or neuromuscular problems) that would affect their
             lower extremity function or ability to walk independently.

          -  Subjects having knee, lower leg or foot pain of a non-mechanical nature.
