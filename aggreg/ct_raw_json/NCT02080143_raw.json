Examples of such drugs\n             include vasoactive (constrictor or dilator) medications, prescription or OTC, that\n             could modulate blood flow, within 24 hours prior to or during the application of\n             study products, including nitroglycerin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory products\n             (NSAIDs, e.g., ibuprofen, aspirin (<=81 mg/day is acceptable)), topical\n             corticosteroids and OTC cough/cold products including antihistamines and/or either\n             phenylpropanolamine or phentolamine;\n\n          -  subjects who have used systemic steroids (i.e., oral, IV, IM or intra-articular) 30\n             days prior to the application of test articles (intranasal/inhaled steroids are\n             acceptable);\n\n          -  subjects who have received an investigational medication or device within 30 days\n             prior to enrollment into this study;\n\n          -  subjects who have a history of sensitivity to any of the study products or adhesion\n             materials;\n\n          -  subjects who are currently participating in an investigational study;\n\n          -  subjects who are known to be noncompliant or are unlikely to comply with the\n             requirements of the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, product dependency,\n             mental incapacity) in the opinion of the investigator."
