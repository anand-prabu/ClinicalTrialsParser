The central hypothesis\n      is that aging reduces mTORC1 signaling and the expression of skeletal muscle amino acid\n      transporters in response to anabolic stimulation leading to reduced muscle adaptation to\n      increased intracellular amino acid requirements. The investigators further hypothesize that\n      inactivity exacerbates this effect with significant muscle and functional loss, and\n      rehabilitation restores muscle signaling, metabolism and function to baseline values."
