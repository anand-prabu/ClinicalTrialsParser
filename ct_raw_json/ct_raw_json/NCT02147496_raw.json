Experiment 1: The specific objective is to examine the effects of\n      isocaloric and isovolumetric amounts of 2% M.F. milk, 1% M.F. chocolate milk, 1.5% M.F.\n      yogurt drink, tropical punch and water consumed before and within a pizza meal 60 min later\n      on appetite and food intake. Experiment 2 will compare the effects of 2% M.F. milk and\n      tropical punch consumed before and with a pizza meal 60 min later on food intake, blood\n      glucose, and appetite hormone response."
