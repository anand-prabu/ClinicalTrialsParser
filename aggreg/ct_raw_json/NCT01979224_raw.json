Unfortunately only 2.4% of American asthmatics meet internationally\n      recommended criteria for control. The lack of knowledge in parents of asthmatic children has\n      been a direct result of minimum or no control at all, so the educational programs need to be\n      assessed in terms of improvement of the control. Target. To determine whether an educational\n      intervention aimed at parents of asthmatic children 4 to 11 years improved clinical control\n      measured by Test Childhood Asthma Control. Material and Methods. Randomized controlled\n      clinical trial in 42 patients randomly divided into two groups that were evaluated in the\n      same time knowledge and control of asthma, a measurement was performed at baseline and\n      monthly for nine months. The experimental group attended an educational intervention for\n      individual reinforcements through this period, the control group was only monitored"
