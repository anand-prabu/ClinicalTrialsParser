            "textblock": "Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have been identified as important tools,\n      allowing for health gains and reducing costs. They have been associated with positive\n      results in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, equity, accessibility and quality of the\n      provided care/services (Alca\u00f1iz et al., 2009; Baulch et al., 2008; Cottrell, 2005; Grohol,\n      1999). The existence of accurate, reliable, structured and relevant information, available\n      when and where is needed, enables professionals and consumers to make informed and timely\n      decisions (High Commissioner for Health, 2010; Organization for Economic Cooperation and\n      Development, 2010).\n\n      This project was designed according to the national guidelines (Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral da Sa\u00fade,\n      2005), and has the potential to become a relevant educational and intervention instrument.\n      Its content may be adapted to the needs and expectations of target groups. Strategies as\n      problem solving reinforced by the e-therapeutic programme may enable participants to\n      overcome barriers to adherence and thereby enhance treatment-induced weight losses (Murawski\n      et al., 2009). Moreover, this project will allow to: a) Obtain relevant information about\n      patients and their progress, enabling health professionals to interpret the inputs and send\n      feedback in real time, b) Tailor therapeutic strategies to individual responses, c) Monitor\n      individual progress.\n\n      This study is designed as a randomized clinical trial. The experimental group will follow\n      the standard treatment protocol and, additionally, receive free access to the e-therapeutic\n      platform (Next.Step) for 24 weeks. The control group participants will follow the standard\n      treatment protocol and join a waiting list for entering the Next.Step.\n\n      Based on the literature review and on the contribution of the Nola Pender's Health Promotion\n      reference model (Pender et al., 2010), investigators will look for empirical evidence for\n      the general investigation hypothesis: treatment adherence, healthy lifestyles, quality of\n      life and weight control of obese adolescents are positively influenced by this intervention\n      program."
