Participants will keep\n      upright position from the time of study drug administration until 4 hours after study drug\n      administration. Participants will not be allowed to ingest meal until 4 hours post-dose.\n      Participants will have standardized lunch and dinner at 4 hours and 10 hours post-dose,\n      respectively. Drinking water will not be allowed from 1 hour before the administration up to\n      1 hour after administration except for the water served with the study drug and meal.\n      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed in blood samples which will be collected up to 72 hours\n      after administration of study drug.
