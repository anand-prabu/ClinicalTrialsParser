      This is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know
      the identity of the intervention), single dose, 2-cycle, crossover (method used to switch
      participants from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study), and bioequivalence
      (biological equivalence of two formulations of a study medication) study of DOXIL/CAELYX in
      participants with advanced or refractory solid malignancies (including at least 24
      participants with ovarian cancer). This study has an adaptive 2-stage design. Bioequivalence
      based on encapsulated doxorubicin will be tested at the end of Stage 1 using data from at
      least 24 participants with ovarian cancer. An interim analysis of free doxorubicin will be
      performed at the end of Stage 1 using data from 42 participants of all cancer types. The
      study may continue into Stage 2 with additional participants of all cancer types; and final
      evaluation of bioequivalence for free doxorubicin will be performed at the end of Stage 2.
      The study will include a screening phase (within 28 days before the first study medication
      administration) followed by the treatment phase consisting of 2 doxorubicin treatment cycles
      (28 days each) and an end-of-treatment visit on Day 58. Participants may enter an optional
      extension phase after 2 cycles. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse
      events, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory testing, and left
      ventricular ejection fraction (measurement of the percentage of blood leaving the heart each
      time when it contracts) throughout the study. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis
      will be obtained from all participants at specified times over 29 days after starting each
      study drug administration in Cycles 1 and 2 for determination of plasma concentrations of
      encapsulated and free doxorubicin.
