To improve the bioavailability of atovaquone, a new formulation has\n      been prepared as a microparticulate suspension. Since studies in adults have demonstrated\n      substantial safety of this drug, evaluation in children is being pursued.\n\n      Three cohorts of four patients each (ages 2-12 years, 3 months to less than 2 years, and 1\n      month to less than 3 months) receive atovaquone daily for 12 days. The oldest age group is\n      treated first. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, the dose of atovaquone is escalated\n      in subsequent 4-patient cohorts representing each of the age stratifications and (per\n      9/30/94 amendment) in a separate 4-patient cohort aged 3 months to less than 2 years. If two\n      of four patients in a given cohort experience unacceptable toxicity at the initial dose, two\n      additional patients in the same age range are entered. Blood samples are drawn for\n      pharmacokinetic evaluation. Patients are followed to day 24. Per 9/30/94 amendment, patients\n      aged 3 months to less than 2 years of age who received one of the lower doses may re-enroll\n      in the higher dose cohort after a 1-month washout."
