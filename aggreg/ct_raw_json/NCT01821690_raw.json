Subjects will be recruited from\n      community and self-referrals.\n\n      Interested potential participants will be scheduled for an in-person screening visit.\n      Subjects who consent and qualify will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, buspirone or placebo.\n      Stratification to randomization group will occur based on the presence of major or minor\n      depression (defined by PHQ-9 total score >5). Randomized subjects will receive active\n      treatment or placebo. There will be 4 clinic visits. Visits will occur at baseline, for\n      consenting and screening, day 35, day 63 and day 91. At all 4 clinic visits, both the\n      subject and the observer will be given questionnaires regarding the subject's behavior and\n      mood. Day 91 ends the period of the randomized clinical trial phase of the study and the\n      subjects will begin the 1 month continuation phase of the study in which all participants\n      receive active buspirone.\n\n      The following questionnaires will be used as measures of irritability and aggression for the\n      subject and the observer: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI & NPI-Distress), Aggression &\n      Irritability Impact Measure (AIIM) and Global Impression of Change.\n\n      The following questionnaires will be dispensed to the subject only: TBI-Quality of\n      Life-Anger, Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7),\n      PTSD Checklist Civilian (PCL-C), and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E) The Investigator\n      will complete the Clinical Global Impression of change at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 4.  History\n      and Physical Exam, creatinine level (kidney function) and liver function tests will be\n      obtained for eligibility. Serum pregnancy tests will be drawn at screening for females of\n      childbearing potential."
