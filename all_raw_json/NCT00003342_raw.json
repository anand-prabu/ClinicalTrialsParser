Filgrastim (G-CSF) is given subcutaneously on days 3\n      through 10 of each 2-week course. On week 11, patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin IV\n      over 1 hour weekly for 12 weeks.\n\n      Each cohort of 3 patients is entered on sequentially increasing doses of carboplatin. If any\n      patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then 6 patients are entered at that dose\n      level. If 3 patients experience DLT at any dose level, the maximum tolerated dose has been\n      surpassed and a total of 6 patients are treated at the previous level.\n\n      Patients are evaluated at week 16 and at end of study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 18-30 patients accrued into this study over 9-15 months."
