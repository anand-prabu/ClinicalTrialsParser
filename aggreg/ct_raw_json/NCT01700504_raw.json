Exclusion criteria will be chronic renal failure due to possible toxicity of\n      gentamicin and patients undergoing a modified radical mastectomy.\n\n      The patients will be randomized by means of an Internet randomization module into 2 groups:\n      those patients undergoing 2 lavages of the axillary surgical bed with normal saline (Group\n      1) and those ones first undergoing lavage with normal saline followed by a second lavage\n      with a gentamicin solution (Group 2).\n\n      Surgical dissection will be performed using harmonic scalpel (Ultracision, Ethicon\n      Endosurgery, Johnson and Johnson, Cincinnati, OH, USA). Once finished the ALND, a\n      Jackson-Pratt drain will be left in place and connected to a low pressure vacuum device.\n\n      Methodology: Irrigation technique and extraction of microbiological samples:\n\n      The lavage will be performed immediately prior to closure of the wound, once placed the\n      drainage into the cavity. In both groups, prior to the lavage, a microbiological sample from\n      the surgical bed will be obtained with a swab (sample 1), followed by a lavage with 500 ml\n      normal saline. After aspiration of the saline, a new microbiological sample will be obtained\n      (sample 2). In Group 1 a second lavage with 500 ml normal saline will be performed, while in\n      Group 2 the second lavage will be performed with an antibiotic solution, including\n      gentamicin (240 mg) dissolved in 500 ml normal saline. After aspirating this second lavage,\n      a third microbiological sample will be obtained in the same way as the two previous ones, in\n      both groups (sample 3).\n\n      Indication of drain removal and obtention of sample 4:\n\n      After discharge, the patient will be asked to quantify the drainage volume daily. Drain will\n      be removed when drainage volume was <30 ml/day. The drainage volume of the last day was\n      collected in a syringe for microbiological study (sample 4)."
