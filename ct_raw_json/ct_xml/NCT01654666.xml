    <textblock>
      Remote limb ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory for
      ischemia- reperfusion injury. As the extent of its effect is unknown, the investigators will
      use clinical outcome, serum biochemical markers and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
      imaging (DW-MRI)to determine the neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory of Long-term Remote
      limb ischemic preconditioning.

      BACKGROUND: Brain ischemia and injury contributed to perioperative morbidity and mortality
      in Carotid Artery Stenting. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), brief periods of
      ischemia followed by reperfusion, can provide systemic protection from prolonged ischemia.
      Our previous study found no significant protection to the patients who received once RIPC
      before Carotid Artery Stenting. In order to investigate whether long-term RIPC before
      Carotid Artery Stenting can protect these patients from perioperative and long-term
      complications, a randomized controlled trial will be performed in the current study.

      DESIGNING about 90 patients will be randomized to Carotid Artery Stenting with RIPC
      group,sham RIPC group and conventional Carotid Artery Stenting group (control). Remote limb
      ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) consisted of five 5-min cycles of right upper arm
      ischemia/reperfusion, which was induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the right
      upper arm which was inflated to 200 mmHg for 5mins followed by deflating the cuff for 5mins,
      each RIPC group patients did it twice a day for two weeks,sham RIPC group patients received
      sham RIPC, consisted of five 5-min cycles of right upper arm ischemia/reperfusion, which was
      induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the right upper arm which was inflated to 20
      mmHg for 5mins followed by deflating the cuff for 5mins, each sham RIPC group patients did
      it twice a day for two weeks. The control group patients received conventional Carotid
      Artery Stenting without RIPC. Cerebral injury was assessed by S-100b, NSE, hs-CRP and MMSE
      test in different time points.
