  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EMPOWER diabetes program is a year-long, community-based program designed to enhance
      diabetes management in rural African American women with uncontrolled diabetes. The
      treatment is delivered by community peers and follows a relative Small Changes approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      East Carolina University, along with established community partners, is implementing a
      community-based and culturally-tailored intervention to reduce diabetes disparities in 200
      rural African American women with uncontrolled diabetes using our unique
      behaviorally-centered small changes approach to diabetes self-management, delivered by
      community health workers. The focus is on moderation and patient-selected small changes in
      eating, activity, and care management that decrease feelings of deprivation and failure and
      increase feelings of confidence and success. The intervention is specifically tailored to
      overcome psychosocial and environmental barriers to behavioral change through a strong focus
      on emotional, cultural, and social factors related to eating, activity, and medications.
      Objectives for the proposed project are to: 1) implement and evaluate the effectiveness of
      this tailored small changes intervention; 2) examine the impact of this approach on
      psychological mediators of behavioral choices in diabetes; 3) implement and evaluate public
      policy and built environment advocacy strategies; and 4) build, sustain, and disseminate a
      business-sustainable care model. The study will be a randomized prospective trial comparing
      the small changes intervention, delivered in 16 sessions by community health workers, to a
      control group receiving 16 mailings of diabetes educational materials. We hypothesize that
      there will be a greater improvement in behavioral choices and glycemic control in the
      intervention group compared to the control group.
