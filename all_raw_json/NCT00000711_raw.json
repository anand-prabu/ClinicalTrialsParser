These individuals could, therefore,\n      benefit from therapy with an effective antiretroviral agent. AZT, which is a powerful\n      inhibitor of human retrovirus, has been approved for management of patients with symptomatic\n      HIV infection. GM-CSF not only stimulates the bone marrow, it enhances the function of\n      mature blood cells and has been found to enhance the ability of AZT to suppress HIV\n      replication in vitro (test tube).
