  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin B12 has several important functions in the body, two of which are production of red
      blood cells and the maintenance of a healthy nervous system. When vitamin B12 is deficient,
      abnormal red blood cells form. These cells are called megaloblasts. The end result is a
      decreased number of red blood cells; a condition called anemia. Some symptoms of anemia
      include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pallor. Vitamin B12 is also important in
      maintaining a healthy nervous system. Nerves are surrounded by an insulating material that
      helps them conduct impulses.  Patients with low B12 levels who receive this vitamin in
      injection form, state that there quality of life is better.  Anemia in Hemodialysis patients
      is treated with Epogen, a synthetic material which helps your body make blood cells.  The
      investigators believe that if you have a low vitamin B12 level in your blood and the
      investigators give you the vitamin during dialysis your requirement for epogen will be lower
      and you will be able to produce blood cells better.  When evaluating for Vitamin B12
      deficiency a special test is needed called methylmalonic acid level (MMA).  This is a blood
      test  that will be performed and when this level is high and your vitamin B12 level is in
      the low normal range the investigators can make a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.

    <description>Consented subjects are screened for Vitamin B12 deficiency with measurments of serum vitamin B12 concentrations and plasma levels of MMA, drawn prior to the first HD session of the week.  Those with an MMA under 800nmol/L are given 1000mcg of IM vitamin B12 weekly for the first month and then monthly for 3 consecutive months. Following therapy, serum B12, MMA levels, percent iron saturation, parathyroid levels and peripheral blood smear are to be repeated and compared to previous levels.  Subjects also complete a KDQOL-36 prior to therapy and again post treatment.</description>
