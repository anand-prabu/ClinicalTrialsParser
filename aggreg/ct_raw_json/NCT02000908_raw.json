Patients who are\n             interested in enrollment will have a baseline neuropathy assessment followed by a\n             second evaluation 1 month later to confirm that the neuropathy is not spontaneously\n             improving (greater than 10% improvement in their mTNS).\n\n          -  Patients will be 18 years or older at the time of signing the consent.\n\n          -  Patients must have GOG performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (see appendix III), and be\n             able to communicate both their symptoms and report the response to neurologic\n             testing.\n\n          -  Patients must have recovered from the acute and remediable effects of surgery,\n             radiation therapy and/or chemoradiotherapy.  At least 3 weeks must have elapsed from\n             the last administration of chemotherapy, and at least three weeks must have elapsed\n             from the last administration of a complete radiation therapy regimen alone or\n             chemoradiation therapy.\n\n          -  Patients with pre-existing neuropathy will be eligible, provided that they have not\n             previously undergone laser therapy for the treatment of their condition.\n\n          -  Patients must be sterile or on adequate birth control.\n\n          -  Patients must have willingly signed an approved consent form, be willing to be\n             randomized to intervention or sham therapy, and be willing to be blinded from\n             directly observing therapy.  Patients completing sham therapy will be offered Realief\n             Therapy in conjunction with physiotherapy free of charge.\n\n          -  Patients must be able to attend therapy at the Realief Neuropathy Center in St. Louis\n             Park as dictated by the requirements of the protocol (3 times/week for up to 8 weeks\n             as well as once 8 weeks following the completion of therapy) AND be evaluated at the\n             University of Minnesota's Gynecologic Cancer Clinic for study assessments (4 planned\n             assessments during and after therapy).  Every effort will be made to co-ordinate\n             these visits with routine health maintenance.\n\n          -  Life expectancy >6 months\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients who have previously received a laser-based therapy for the treatment of\n             neuropathy will be considered ineligible.\n\n          -  Patients with a > 10% improvement from the initial mTNS assessment to the mTNS\n             assessment at the time of study enrollment (four weeks from the original assessment).\n\n          -  Patients with evidence of direct tumor involvement of the nervous system (central or\n             peripheral) will be considered ineligible.\n\n          -  Patients who are pregnant will be considered ineligible.  Class 4 lasers have been\n             inadequately studied in this setting to conclude that there is no risk to a\n             developing fetus.\n\n          -  Patients with the inability to tolerate therapy or blinding due to co-morbid medical\n             or psychiatric illness.\n\n          -  Patients in active treatment of cancer will not be considered eligible."
