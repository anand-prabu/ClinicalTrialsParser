            "textblock": "Wright et al (Anticancer Res, 2000) reported the results of a retrospective study on 11\n      patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancers.  All patients had multi-site disease\n      and were heavily pretreated with a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens. All received\n      bevacizumab combination therapy which was well-tolerated. Two patients had partial\n      responses, 3 had stable disease, while 5 patients progressed. One subject was not assessable\n      for response. The median progression-free interval was 5.4 months for the entire cohort and\n      8.7 months for those who achieved clinical benefit (PR or SD). The authors concluded that\n      Bevacizumab was well-tolerated and displayed promising anti-neoplastic activity in patients\n      with endometrial cancer.The rationale for combining anti-angiogenic agents, including\n      anti-VEGF antibodies, with cytotoxic chemotherapy stems from a number of preclinical studies\n      showing additive and synergistic anti-tumour activity in a number of solid tumour types. By\n      combining VEGF-targeting agents such as bevacizumab with conventional chemotherapies, it is\n      hoped that these agents will act synergistically, thereby enhancing their anti-tumour\n      efficacy and controlling disease progression.\n\n      The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy has been shown to improve PFS and/or OS in a\n      series of large, randomized Phase III clinical trials in a wide range of tumour types,\n      including mCRC,  non-squamous NSCLC, metastatic BC (mBC) and mRCC."
