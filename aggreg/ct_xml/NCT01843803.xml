      This study will use a multi-phase mixed-methods approach to develop and test a patient
      inventory to facilitate patient-centered care delivery. In Phase I the investigators will
      identify which factors should be considered for inclusion in the patient inventory. This
      will involve qualitative data collection with providers and patients using interviews and
      focus groups, respectively; and developing a question repository.  The interviews and focus
      groups will take place at the six study sites:  Hines VA Hospital and two CBOCs in LaSalle,
      IL and Kankakee, IL; Jesse Brown VA Medical Center; and two CBOCs in Crown Point, IN; and
      Chicago Heights, IL.  The question repository will involve a research assistant performing a
      literature review to gather items related to areas of patient context.

      Phase II will develop and test an item inventory using a Delphi panel - a panel of
      stakeholders including Veteran representatives, VA providers, researchers and
      representatives from our operations partners.  The panel of at least 14 respondents will
      develop a questionnaire through three rounds of email exchanges ranking the list of items to
      be included in the patient inventory.  Once the patient inventory is finalized, it will be
      integrated into an iPad application for patient use.

      In Phase III the investigators will test the patient inventory in a randomized trial.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial of the patient inventory to a control
      condition (e.g., healthy living video) to assess whether use of the inventory results in
      care that is more patient-centered and decisions that are more collaborative.  Eligible
      participants will be identified and recruited from the PACT clinics at Hines and Jess Brown
      VA facilities.  Patients will be randomly assigned to either complete the patient inventory
      on the iPad or watch a health video on the iPad.  Patients in the Intervention group will
      give a copy of the summary of the inventory to their provider.  Both groups will be asked to
      carry a concealed tape recorder during their visit.  Following the visit, patients in both
      groups will complete a set of questionnaires about the encounter including the CARE and CCM.
       Patients will be given $20 for their participating.  The recordings will be analyzed by the
      team using a coding system developed in a previous HSR&amp;D study to see if the use of the
      patient inventory facilitated patient-centered care during the encounter.  A second coding
      scheme, the RPAD will also be applied to examine collaborative decision making.

      Research Design and Methods:  This study will utilize a multi-phase mixed-methods approach
      to develop and test a patient inventory to facilitate patient-centered care delivery. In
      Phase I the investigators will identify which factors should be considered for inclusion in
      the patient inventory. This will involve interviews and focus groups with providers and
      patients, respectively; and a review of the relevant literature. In Phase II the
      investigators will develop and test an inventory using a Delphi panel and assembling a
      questionnaire repository. In Phase III the investigators will conduct a randomized trial
      comparing the patient inventory to a control condition (e.g., healthy living video) to
      assess whether use of the inventory results in care that is more patient-centered and
      decisions that are more collaborative.

      Phase I: To identify patient contextual factors and preferences, and patients' experiences,
      awareness, resources, and willingness to use technology for care delivery, the investigators
      will conduct focus groups with patients at 2 facilities and 4 CBOCs in VISN12 representing
      urban and rural settings and a mix of sociodemographic characteristics.

      In order to capture the perspective of Veterans who live in more rural areas and who may
      represent a broader range of socio-demographic characteristics, the investigators will
      conduct focus groups at four CBOCs associated with the medical facilities that represent
      urban/rural and ethnic diversity.

      The investigators plan to recruit both patients who have received care through technology
      (e.g., home telehealth (HT), CVT) and those who have had little or no experience with care
      delivered through technology. The investigators will conduct separate focus groups with
      patients who have received care through technology and those who have not used technology
      for health care. Focus group discussions will be transcribed verbatim and analyzed using
      constant comparative techniques to code the data thematically. This information will serve
      as the foundation for developing the inventory.

      A total of 8-12 focus groups will be conducted with 5-8 Veteran participants per group (n=40
      to 96 patients). The investigators will conduct 2 focus groups at each VA facility, and 1-2
      focus groups at each CBOC. Based on prior experience conducting focus groups with Veterans,
      the investigators believe that this number of focus groups will provide sufficient data to
      reach saturation, the point at which no new information is uncovered during group
      discussion. Two members of the research team will manage each focus group.

      Patient Focus Group Questions. A discussion guide that includes open-ended items with probes
      and follow-up questions will be used to conduct focus groups with patients. The guide
      consists of questions designed to generate discussion among participants concerning
      contextual factors, patient-centered care, and technology use for health care delivery. The
      first set of questions will assist in identifying contextual factors that affect patients'
      abilities to manage their care. The second set of questions will explore patients'
      understanding of and preferences for patient-centered care. The final set of questions will
      describe patients' awareness of, available resources, and willingness to use health
      technology.

      Data will be analyzed using constant comparative techniques consistent with a
      grounded-theory approach

      Provider Interviews. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with healthcare providers
      at each of the sites. Providers will consist of PACT and/or primary care team members
      including nurse care managers and physicians. The investigators will use semi-structured
      interviews for providers because of the added flexibility afforded by this method with
      respect to time and scheduling. The investigators developed a semi-structured interview
      guide to address our research objectives. The first set of questions is designed to identify
      contextual factors and understand how providers attempt to address them. Data will be
      analyzed using the same process detailed for analysis of focus group data (i.e., constant
      comparative techniques consistent with grounded theory).

      Question Repository. In parallel with focus groups and interviews, our research assistant
      will review the available literature through PubMed, psycINFO and other reference search
      engines for surveys/questionnaires that include items related to areas of patient context.
      Initial search terms include:  assessment tool, assessment scale, risk assessment,
      contextual factors, patient questionnaires and context specific terms such as technology
      resources, social support and patient-centered care. We will assemble a repository of
      questions that could be used for our inventory. If there are contextual areas in which we
      are unable to find adequate questions, the investigators will generate items for
      consideration by the Delphi panel.

      Phase II: Creating the Patient Inventory. Using findings from focus groups, information from
      the literature, and input from an expert panel the investigators will draft a patient
      inventory that can serve as a collaborative decision tool for patients and providers. The
      investigators will work with the expert panel to identify and refine the content areas for
      the inventory using a modified Delphi panel approach. The goal of the project is  to develop
      an instrument that would take no more than 10-15 minutes for a patient to complete.

      Participants/procedures. A heterogeneous panel will be chosen based on participants'
      willingness to participate and knowledge of the relevant topic.  Because patients are the
      key stakeholder for patient-centered care, we will assemble a panel that includes Veteran
      representatives, VA providers, researchers and representatives from our operations partners.
      To maintain at least 14 respondents (70%), we will initially recruit 20 panelists (5 in each
      stakeholder group).

      The investigators will conduct the Delphi process through a series of email exchanges. In
      the first email round, a list of possible items for each of the context areas will be
      distributed. Panelists will be asked to rank the importance of the areas of context
      identified, comment on whether they feel that there is redundancy in categories, and provide
      input on the relevance of items within each content area to patient context,
      patient-centered care and/or collaborative decision-making. We will also ask an open-ended
      question allowing panel members to identify areas that they feel should be included.
      Reponses will be entered without identification of the panelists. Each participant will be
      assigned an ID code. Categories and items for which the panelists agree do not fit or are
      redundant with other items that are better worded, and those items that are ranked very low
      will be dropped.

      A revised set of categories and items will be sent to the panelists for a second round of
      review. At that time, the panelists will repeat the process used for the first round review.
      A final draft will be sent to the panel for one more review. The investigators will also
      include feedback about qualitative comments made by panelists in each round and data about
      specific item ratings (e.g., median, lowest and highest ratings per item, etc.)  The
      responses to this last review will be used to finalize the patient inventory. The
      investigators anticipate that this process will take approximately 4-5 months to complete
      the Inventory Template. Once  the patient inventory is finalized, the investigators will
      integrate them into an iPad application for patient use. The iPad provides multiple
      advantages for collecting patient information, providing a portable, touch-driven multimedia
      experience popular across different demographic strata. The iPad inventory will include skip
      patterns for respondents to jump over non-relevant items, out-of-range checking and
      validation so that respondents do not enter erroneous information, drop-down boxes, and
      utilize examples and explanations for clarity. Patients will have the opportunity to &quot;not
      answer&quot; any items, based on personal comfort of what information should be shared.

      The investigators will perform iterative testing of the iPad version of the inventory to
      ensure acceptability by patients. All information entered in the iPad will be kept private
      and secure, such that other patients cannot access any stored data. As an additional
      safeguard, the iPad will &quot;time out&quot; if not used for some duration of time to prevent
      extraneous viewing by others. The iPad will be used in waiting areas by patients prior to
      encounters with health care providers. Research staff will maintain the iPad, including
      charging, storing securely when not in use to prevent theft, applying anti-bacterial
      cleaner, and monitoring device use.

      When patients use the iPad inventory, the application will create a brief report summarizing
      patient preferences and contextual factors. This report will be available to the PACT at the
      point of care to facilitate patient/provider communication and collaborative
      decision-making. For the initial study, research staff will facilitate communication of the
      report to health care providers by generating a paper summary that patients will hand to
      providers. However, design and testing will consider future implementation strategies,
      including incorporation into clinical workflow patterns and adoption by clinical staff.

      Phase III: Testing the Patient Inventory.  The investigators plan to pilot the patient
      inventory in a sample of Veterans in two sets of PACT clinics; one at Hines and the other at
      JBVA. The study design is a randomized controlled trial.  The investigators will randomize
      half the patients to complete the patient inventory and the other half to a control
      condition (i.e., health video). The investigators will stratify by VAMC to ensure that there
      are equal samples. The randomization scheme will be developed using computer generated
      random assignment.

      Eligible patients will be identified and recruited from the PACT clinics at Hines and Jesse
      Brown VAMCs. No subjects will be excluded based on gender, race, or ethnicity. Eligibility
      criteria include: (1) adult, age 18 or over; (2) assigned primary care provider in PACT
      clinic; (3) no history of dementia; (4) no blindness (unable to view iPad app). Only
      patients of participating providers will be eligible for the study, to ensure both patient
      and provider consent to audio-recordings and study procedures.

      It is possible that providers will discern that their visits with patients that involve the
      use of 'summary' forms are the same visits that will be audio-recorded. To address the
      likelihood of a Hawthorne effect the following strategies will been undertaken.  First,
      providers will be informed that some of the visits that are recorded will include patients
      providing additional written information for providers while other visits will not include
      this information. Second, the investigators will undertake sensitivity analyses comparing
      data from the first 10% of audio-recorded encounters to the 2nd and 5th 10% of encounters.
      The investigators will assess whether provider behavior is significantly different at these
      points in time. If the first several visits result in different behavior then later visits,
      the investigators can eliminate the first recordings from our analyses. Thus, the
      investigators will over-recruit patients by 10%, with patients evenly distributed between
      intervention and control arms.

      Intervention: The patient inventory developed through focus groups and Delphi panel will
      serve as the intervention. The inventory will be deployed using an iPad. Patients will
      provide a copy of the summary to their provider at the beginning of their visit.

      Control Condition. To address concerns about a Hawthorne effect, the investigators will
      implement an attention control. The control group will use the iPad to will view a brief
      health video (e.g., 8-10 minutes) containing general health information. The VA National
      Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) is currently developing a set of
      video-based health living messages. The investigators will utilize one of these videos in
      for our control group. Alternatively, AHRQ has developed several videos that are available
      at no cost and are 508 compliant. The 'Be involved in your health care - Questions are the
      answer' is a 7 minute video that is focused on talking to your provider and asking questions
      (http://www.ahr.gov/questions/video/waitroom/). Control patients will also be asked to
      audio-record their encounter with their provider, but not to reveal that they are doing so.

      Patients will complete the informed consent process, agreeing to use of the iPad to either
      complete an inventory or view a video about their health, willingness to have their
      encounter with the provider audio recorded, and completion of a set of questionnaires
      following the clinic visit. Consenting patients will complete the patient inventory or view
      the video on an iPad prior to their clinic visit. A research assistant will instruct the
      patient on how to use the iPad and what the patient needs to do to complete the
      questionnaire (in the intervention condition). The RA will be available to answer questions
      or provide additional instruction, as needed. After intervention patients complete the
      questionnaire, the RA will hook the iPad up to a portable printer so that a hard copy of the
      inventory can be generated for patients to immediately give their provider. The patient will
      proceed to his/her visit with the provider. To ensure adequate use of the iPad and the
      patient inventory, the RA will be available to assist subjects in use as necessary. The
      research team will collect information on how frequently assistance is needed, and form of
      support provided. We estimate the inventory will take approximately 10-15 minutes to
      complete. Patients will have the opportunity to complete the inventory in a designated,
      private area to reduce interruptions and distractions.

      In both the intervention and control arms, patients will be asked to conceal a small
      recording device in their pocket and/or bag in order to record their conversation with the
      provider. The patient will be told that the provider has agreed to be recorded during some
      of their patient visits but that the provider will not know which visits will be recorded.
      The RA will turn the device on before handing it to the patient and the patient will return
      the recorder after the visit. Weiner has successfully utilized this strategy in two HSRD
      funded studies.

      Following the clinic visit, the patient will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires.
      These items will be completed using paper and pencil. We will also ask patients to indicate
      whether they have used any technology for their health care using a checklist (use of home
      telehealth, CVT, secure messaging, prescription refills through MHV, use of mobile apps like
      PTSD coach, accessing VA Facebook or twitter sites) and whether any future care plans
      include use of technology. Patients will be given $20 for their participation to cover their
      time and any expenses related to parking, etc.

      Providers. PACT providers will also serve as research subjects for the study. The
      investigators will ask providers to consent to having some of their encounters recorded over
      a one year period. The investigators will explain to providers that they are interested in
      examining the effects of providing or not providing additional patient-generated information
      to providers at the time of their visit on patient/provider interactions. Providers will be
      assured that no identifiable information will be recorded on the transcriptions (e.g.,
      providers will be referred to by a unique study ID number). The investigators will also ask
      providers to participate in a debriefing interview at the end of the study to ask them about
      the value and use of the pre-visit patient inventory in their encounters with patients.
      Only patients of providers who consent to participate will be approached about study
      participation.

      Study Measures: To determine patient-centeredness the investigators will ask patients to
      tell them about their experiences with care and the extent to which care they received met
      their preferences and addressed their contextual factors. The investigators will utilize
      measures of patient-centeredness including the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE)
      measure and the Consultation Care Measure (CCM).

      To objectively evaluate the extent to which care being provided is patient-centered, we will
      obtain audiotapes of patient/provider encounters and code them using Weiner's 4C analysis
      measure and the Rochester Decision Making Scale to evaluate collaborative decision making
      during  patient/provider encounters. These measures are described below:

      CARE. The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure is a process measure of empathy
      and holistic care in the context of a therapeutic relationship. Mercer defines empathy in
      the medical encounter as the ability of the provider to understand the patient's situation,
      perspective and feelings; to communicate to the patient what their understanding is and
      check whether s/he is correct in this interpretation, and then to act in a way that is
      helpful and therapeutic .This description fits into many definitions of patient-centered
      care. The CARE measure has 10 items and it specifically asks about today's consultation. To
      better fit the definition of care in the US, we will change the word consultation to
      'visit.' For each item, the respondent rates their response as poor, fair, good, very good,
      excellent, or does not apply.  Questions include: How was the provider at 'making you feel
      at ease', 'letting you tell your &quot;story&quot;', 'being positive.' The score for each item is
      added for a maximum score of 50 and minimum of 10; a higher score reflects greater
      'patient-centeredness'.

      CCM. The Consultation Care Measure (CCM)  measures a patient's perceptions of
      patient-centered care during their last visit with their provider. There are 5 subscales in
      this 21-item scale. CCM assesses communication and partnership (11 items), personal
      relationship (3 items), health promotion (2 items), positive and clear approach to the
      problem (3 items), interest in effect on life (2 items). The items use a 4-point Likert
      scale for scoring from 1= very strongly agree to 2= strongly agree to 3=agree to
      4=neutral/disagree. Cronbach's   reliabilities range from 0.84 to 0.96 for the subscales. A
      higher level of patient-centeredness based on the CCM (lower score) was associated with
      short-term better health outcomes.

      Rochester Participatory Decision-Making Scale (RPAD). The RPAD was developed to provide a
      reliable and valid objective measure of patient-physician collaborative decision making.
      There are nine items in the scale and it is based on coding audio-recordings of
      patient/provider encounters. The areas covered include: whether the provider explains the
      clinical issue or nature of the decision, discussion of the uncertainties associated with
      the 'situation', clarification of agreement, barriers to follow-thorough with the treatment
      plan, provider gives patient the opportunity to ask questions and checks patient's
      understanding of the treatment plan, the provider's language matches the patient's level of
      understanding, the provider asks 'Any questions?', the provider asks open-ended questions,
      and the provider checks his/her understanding of the patient's point of view. Each item is
      scored as 0,   or 1 for each encounter. The interclass correlation coefficient for the RPAD
      was 0.72. Drs. Shields and Epstein, authors of the RPAD, have made the coding manual
      available to us and are available if we have any questions.

      Content Coding for Contextualizing Care (4C). The 4C analysis is methodology for assessing
      patient centered clinical decision making. Specifically, 4C rates encounters based on
      whether the provider (a) probes for clinically relevant context and (b) plans the care
      accordingly. The analysis is generated from both the patient's medical record and from an
      audio recording of the provider-patient visit. 4C may be conducted by as few as two
      individuals or as many as five, with the additional personnel required to verify inter-rater
      reliability and other sources of evidence for validity. Coding will be done by an
      experienced coder who has worked with Dr. Weiner on two prior studies utilizing the 4C
      analysis.

      Sample size/power: Our primary measure of patient-centered care is the CARE measure.
      Normative data on the CARE indicates a mean score of 40.8 (range 10-50) with a
      between-physician variance of patients receiving care from the same physician,   = 9.0247,
      and within-patient variance   = 69.2149, for a total variance   = 78.2396 (SD=8.85) (Mercer
      2005). Without taking into account related patient CARE scores of patients being treated by
      the same physician, 64 patients in both control and intervention groups (total n=128) will
      be adequate to detect a moderate effect size (Cohen's d=0.5) at the 0.05 level with 0.8
      power. Of course, patients receiving care from the same physician might respond similarly to
      questions regarding empathy and holistic care pertaining to their physician, as recorded by
      the CARE measure. The multiplicative effect on the standard error due to clustering is 1 +
      (m-1)*ICC, where m represents the size of each cluster (patients per physician) and ICC the
      intraclass correlation of same-physician patient CARE outcomes. 25 doctors with 11 patients
      each, or 24 doctors with 12 patients each will be sufficient in detecting a moderate effect
      size (Cohen's d=0.5) at the 0.05 level with 0.8 power. Accounting for the possibility that
      patients may change their mind, be too fatigued, and/or have not enough time to complete the
      post-visit questions, or deficiencies in physician attrition, we have added an additional
      10% (28 more patients/25-26 physicians) to the total.

      The total study sample size is 25-26 providers and   300-308; 150-154 patients per group.

      Patients enrolled in the PACT clinics at Hines and Jesse Brown will serve as the patient
      subject pool and the providers in these PACT teams will serve as the provider subjects. Only
      patients who are in the panels of providers who consent to participate will be recruited for
      the study.

      Analysis: Descriptive statistics including frequencies and means will be calculated to
      characterize our patient sample, including demographics (e.g., mean age, gender,
      ethnicity/race). The investigators will utilize t-tests to make comparisons of intervention
      and comparison groups on the patient measures. The overall scores and the subscale scores
      for the CARE and the CCM will be compared using t-tests. They will then examine the extent
      to which other characteristics including study site (Hines, JBVA) and patient
      characteristics (age, race) account for differences in ratings of patient-centered care
      using linear regression models. The investigators will use the standard formula Y = a + b1X
      + b2X +. biX, with no more than 15 covariates (using 1 covariate for every 10 observations)
      in addition to the intervention effect (b1). As many patients may have the same provider,
      there could be an effect for provider. They will explore use of multi-level modeling to
      account for provider effects.

      4C Coding and Analysis. 4C analysis rates encounters based on whether the provider probes
      for clinically relevant context and plans care accordingly. The analysis uses both the
      patient's medical record and an audio- recording of the provider-patient visit. 4C coding
      includes the following:

        1. Contextual red flag identification: Following an encounter, the first step for coders
           is to determine if there were any contextual red flags that the provider would need to
           have explored to provide appropriate care. Red flags include things like missed
           appointments, non-adherence of medications or receipt of laboratory tests or
           deterioration of chronic illness (e.g., uncontrolled blood pressure). A contextual red
           flag is defined as anything a patient says or that was observed about his situation or
           behavior that suggests that contextual factors were not addressed and may be
           contributing to problems with their care. The search for contextual red flags begins
           with a structured medical record review by a contextual red flag &quot;screener&quot;. If no
           flags are found in the medical record the coder listens to the audio-recording to
           determine if the patient made statements suggesting underlying contextual issues
           essential to their care. For example: a. Contextual red flag identified from chart
           review: Rising systolic blood pressure in patient with hypertension who has been
           previously well controlled. b. Contextual red flag identified from audio-recording:
           Visually impaired veteran with hypertension mentions that his daughter, who sets up his
           medications in a daily pill box, has relocated to another city for her job.

        2. Coder(s) formulate an unambiguous direct probe of red flag: The coder(s) compose an
           unambiguous provider probe to the identified contextual red flag, e.g. &quot;I notice that
           your hypertension used to be well controlled but your blood pressure has been very high
           over the last couple of months. What do you think is going on in your life that might
           be a factor in this problem?&quot; The probe is always in the form of a question by the
           provider in response to a red flag. The purpose of this exercise is to help the coder
           identify what s/he should be listening for to indicate that the provider has noticed
           and is pursuing the contextual red flag.

        3. Coder listens for clinician probe: The coder then listens for whether the provider
           pursued the contextual red flag in a manner that substantively approximates their
           direct probe.

        4. Coder listens for a 'patient reveal' in response to a probe: If the provider probed,
           the coder determines whether the patient revealed contextual information that is
           relevant to care, such as &quot;It's a lot more difficult for me to remember to take my
           medication when I'm supposed to since my daughter left.&quot;

        5. Coder formulates an unambiguous direct response to the patient reveal: If the patient
           reveals contextual issues in response to the probe, the coder formulates an unambiguous
           response to the reveal that indicates the provider recognized the need to contextualize
           the care plan, e.g. &quot;Let's talk about how you could change your medication schedule to
           help you remember.&quot;

        6. Coder listens for contextualization of care plan: The coder then listens for whether
           the provider recommends a plan of care that substantively approximates their direct
           probe. (e.g., switches all medications to morning)

      Because coding can be quite nuanced, Weiner et al. has developed a comprehensive training
      manual, similar to those developed for other coding systems, such as Debra Roter's &quot;Roter
      Interaction Analysis System&quot;, or RIAS, utilized for coding physician patient communication.
      RIAS codes interactional process behaviors (e.g. when clinician or patient asks open vs
      closed ended questions, gives instructions, asks for understanding, paraphrases, etc.) but
      not content. The 4C coding manual is available from Dr. Weiner, co-inv on the study.
      (http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/4C)

      RPAD analysis. The items on the 9-item RPAD are each scored as 0,  , and 1. Summing across
      the 9 items results in a range of scores from 0 if the provider exhibits none of the
      behaviors of participatory decision making to 9 if s/he does them all. We will examine the
      mean per item and the mean of the sum, comparing by intervention vs. control using t-tests
      with p&lt;.05 indicating significance. We will also correlate the RPAD summary score with the
      4C percents for identifying contextual factors, and providing appropriate care.

      Cost impact: In this study, the investigators will conduct a cost-identification analysis to
      assess the cost of providing the intervention in this study. Additionally, they will conduct
      a budget impact analysis to assess the impact on costs to a VA medical center of
      implementing the patient inventory. The cost of the intervention includes the cost of the
      equipment needed for the intervention (i.e., the iPad and printer) and the cost of any
      change in clinic personnel time that results from the intervention. The patient inventories
      may impact clinic personnel's time due to the need to train and assist the patient in
      entering the inventory as well as potentially changing the duration of the clinic visit due
      to discussions facilitated by the patient inventory.  The RA will record 1) the time it
      takes to train each patient to use the iPad, 2) the time it takes for each patient to
      complete the patient inventory and the proportion of this time the RA spent assisting the
      patient, and 3) the time it takes to print the inventory for the patient to give to the
      provider. Additionally, the RA will record whether it interferes with being on time for the
      clinic visit. The RA will also record the length of the provider/patient encounter by
      recording the time the provider entered the clinic room to see the patient and then when he
      leaves the room/completes the visit. In order to make comparisons to usual care, the RA also
      will record the length of time of usual encounters by timing the encounters of the control
      patients in the randomized.

      The investigators will also conduct a budget impact analysis to evaluate the cost of
      implementing the intervention at a VA medical center. The estimated budget impact on the
      medical center will be sum of the purchase price of the equipment, the cost of the clerical
      personnel's time, and the cost of physicians' time (which will be estimated as an average
      physician's wage multiplied by the difference in the average time of clinic visits between
      intervention and control patients). The investigators will estimate the total cost of
      providing the intervention to patients under the alternative scenarios regarding the number
      of patients who would complete the inventory and the amount of equipment that would need to
      be purchased.

    <description>CARE is a process measure of empathy and holistic care in the context of a therapeutic relationship (medical visit).  It has 10 items, each rated from poor to excellent.  Example items include:  How was the provider at 'making you feel at ease'; letting you tell your story.'  Score are added for a maximum of 50, min of 10; higher score reflects greater patient-centeredness.</description>

    <description>The RPAD was developed to provide a reliable and valid measure of patient-physician collaborative decision making.  there are 9 items in the scale based on audio-recordings of patient-provider encounters.   Items include: whether the provider explains the clinical issue or nature of the decision, discussion of the uncertainties associated with the situation, etc.  Each item is scored 0, 1/2 or 1 for each encounter.  Total scores range from 0 to 9.</description>
