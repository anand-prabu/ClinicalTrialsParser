Before enrolling a subject with past or current history of\n                  any of the above conditions, the investigator must contact the sponsor to\n                  discuss whether the condition could have contributed to the cognitive\n                  impairment.\n\n          6. Clinically significant infarct or possible multi-infarct dementia as defined by the\n             NINCDS criteria, including:\n\n               -  A history of a significant cerebrovascular event resulting in a physical or\n                  neurologic deficit that may confound the assessment of the subject's\n                  intellectual function;\n\n               -  Multiple focal signs on neurologic examination indicative of multiple ischemic\n                  episodes;\n\n               -  One or more of the following findings on a MRI scan:\n\n                    -  Multiple (two or more) infarcts or white matter lacunes;\n\n                    -  A single large infarct or a strategically placed infarct in the angular\n                       gyrus, the thalamus, the basal forebrain, the posterior cerebral artery\n                       (PCA) or anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory;\n\n               -  Extensive periventricular white matter disease. Leukoaraiosis (periventricular\n                  white matter, low attenuation) should be distinguished from multiple\n                  infarctions. Leukoaraiosis is common in normal individuals and patients with AD.\n                  White matter deterioration should not result in exclusion unless it is abnormal\n                  and widespread, e.g., Binswanger's disease;\n\n          7. Any evidence on screening MRI, computed tomography (CT), or other biomarker studies\n             that suggests an alternate etiology (other than probable AD in subjects with AD) for\n             cognitive deficit; or in the case of cognitively normal controls any evidence on\n             screening MRI, CT, or other biomarker studies that suggests the presence of AD\n             pathology;\n\n          8. Current clinically significant psychiatric disease, as judged by Diagnostic and\n             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, particularly\n             current major depression or schizophrenia. Subjects with dementia who are\n             experiencing behavioral disturbances that may require treatment with psychotropic\n             medications may be entered only after discussion and with the approval of the\n             sponsor. The investigator and sponsor should carefully consider whether subjects with\n             behavioral dysfunction will be able to complete the imaging session;\n\n          9. History of epilepsy or convulsions, except for febrile convulsions during childhood;\n\n         10.

Clinically significant\n             cardiovascular disease usually includes one or more of the following:\n\n               -  cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months;\n\n               -  unstable angina;\n\n               -  coronary artery disease that required an increase in medication within the last\n                  3 months;\n\n               -  decompensated congestive heart failure;\n\n               -  significant cardiac arrhythmia or conduction disturbance, particularly those\n                  resulting in atrial or ventricular fibrillation, or causing syncope, near\n                  syncope, or other alterations in mental status;\n\n               -  severe mitral or aortic valvular disease;\n\n               -  uncontrolled high blood pressure;\n\n               -  congenital heart disease;\n\n               -  clinically significant abnormal result on ECG, including but not limited to QTc\n                  > 450 msec. Before enrolling a subject with any of the above conditions, the\n                  investigator must contact the sponsor.\n\n         12. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last year, or prior prolonged history of\n             abuse;\n\n         13.

Females of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile, not refraining from\n             sexual activity or not using reliable methods of contraception. Females of\n             childbearing potential must not be pregnant (negative serum beta-hCG at the time of\n             screening and negative urine beta-hCG on the day of imaging) or breastfeeding at\n             screening. Females must agree to avoid becoming pregnant, and must agree to refrain\n             from sexual activity or to use reliable contraceptive methods such as prescribed\n             birth control or IUD for 24 hours following administration of florbetapir (18F);\n\n         15. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are otherwise unsuitable for a\n             study of this type;\n\n         16. History of relevant severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity;\n\n         17. Subjects who have received an investigational medication within the last 30 days.\n\n             Additionally, the time between the last dose of the previous experimental medication\n             and enrollment (completion of screening assessments) must be at least equal to 5\n             times the terminal half-life of the previous experimental medication. Subjects who\n             have ever participated in an experimental study with an amyloid targeting therapy\n             (e.g., immunotherapy, secretase inhibitor) may not be enrolled unless it can be\n             demonstrated that the subject received only placebo in the course of the trial;\n\n         18. Subjects with current clinically significant medical comorbidities, as indicated by\n             history, physical exam, ECG (including but not limited to QTc>450 msec) or laboratory\n             evaluations, that might pose a potential safety risk, interfere with the absorption\n             or metabolism of the study medication or limit interpretation of the trial results.\n             These include but are not limited to clinically significant hepatic, renal,\n             pulmonary, metabolic or endocrine disease, cancer, HIV infection and AIDS;\n\n         19. Subjects who have known hypersensitivity to alcohol; and\n\n         20. Subjects who received a radiopharmaceutical for imaging or therapy within the past 7\n             days prior to the imaging session for this study."
