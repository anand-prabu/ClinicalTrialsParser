No other studies or programs on lung cancer\n      screening were introduced in Russia since then.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of establishing a lung cancer\n      screening program in Russian Federation using LDCT scanning in asymptomatic patients with at\n      least a 30 pack-year history of cigarette smoking. This cohort prospective study is planned\n      to enroll at least 500 current or former smokers.\n\n      Patients will be screened by LDCT scan at baseline with recommendation to perform follow-up\n      in case of any positive result. For nodes more than 10 mm full clinical examination is\n      recommended. For nodes 3-9.9 mm follow-up scans in 1, 3 or 6 months is recommended. For\n      nodes smaller than 3 mm and negative results annual LDCT is recommended. Patient with\n      positive results will be followed until final clinical diagnosis.\n\n      Secondary outcomes include:\n\n        -  Lung cancer diagnoses\n\n        -  Lung cancer and overall mortality\n\n        -  Quality of life assessment\n\n        -  Complications of diagnostic and surgical procedures following a positive result.\n\n        -  Comparison of independent radiological evaluation of scans."
