  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test a new therapy, somatosensory rehabilitation, for the painful
      sensitivity experienced by persons with nerve injuries and/or complex regional pain syndrome
      (CRPS).    Several methods for measuring pain and sensitivity that emphasize the person's
      evaluation of their own symptoms and the impact of these symptoms on their daily activities
      will also be tested to make sure they are consistent and accurate.

      Previous research has suggested one of the assessments may also be used to assist in the
      identification of CRPS: this simple test will be evaluated to see if it can accurately
      identify persons with this disorder (for which there is currently no diagnostic test).
      Together, this will improve treatment of CRPS through early, accurate diagnosis and the
      ability to measure important changes in this painful condition, and set up future studies
      for this new rehabilitation treatment method.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of a) Complex Regional Pain Syndrome or b) Peripheral Nerve Injury or c)
             recent hand trauma without peripheral nerve injury in a single upper extremity
             confirmed by physician or medical record.

          -  Participant and most responsible physician give consent to exclusive focus on
             somatosensory rehabilitation for the duration of the trial (6 months).  The
             participant may continue any oral medications but any planned use of topical
             medication, injections or IV medication in the affected limb is contra-indicated.
             Use of these modalities in an emergency situation would of course take priority.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cardiac or vascular disease or known sensitivity to sympathetic stress or
             cold intolerance or medically unstable

          -  Confounding diagnoses: whiplash, nerve root compression, metabolic diseases such as
             diabetes or thyroid problems, and/or peripheral neuropathy

          -  Open wounds on testing sites

          -  Unable to provide informed consent
