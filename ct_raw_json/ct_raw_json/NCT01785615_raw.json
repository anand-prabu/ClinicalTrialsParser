Less is known about adequate treatment as the\n      pathological mechanism of this syndrome is not well understood.\n\n      The purpose of this study is two fold;\n\n        1. To determine basic differences in biochemical and cardiovascular structural markers in\n           women with and those without MBS and their association with the individual components\n           of MBS.\n\n        2. To determine the impact of atorvastatin to lower the risk factors of Metabolic\n           Syndrome.  Atorvastatin is one of the most effective drugs approved by the United\n           States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of high cholesterol.  It\n           belongs to a class of drugs called statins and its role in primary prevention is still\n           unclear. Thus this population seems to be an ideal group that may benefit from this\n           intervention."
