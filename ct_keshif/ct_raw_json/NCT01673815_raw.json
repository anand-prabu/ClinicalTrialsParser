This study explored whether viewing a video (selected by patient or\n      caregiver) during eye examination improves the success, duration and ease of pediatric\n      fundoscopy.\n\n      Hypothesis: Showing a short video clip during a fundoscopic exam will increase the\n      probability of successfully visualizing the optic disk and reduce the amount of time needed\n      to perform a fundoscopic exam in children between 1-8 years old."

The\n      investigators will also examine the physician's and caregiver's perception on whether the\n      video was effective in improving the ease of the exam. The purpose of the video is to\n      capture the visual attention of the patient thereby allowing the physician to swiftly\n      perform the fundoscopic exam. The literature has suggested that young patients are most\n      uncooperative, therefore the investigators will focus our study on younger patients  1-8\n      years old."
