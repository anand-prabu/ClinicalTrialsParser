These activities\n      are often the target of community-based prevention efforts. Getting To Outcomes (GTO) is an\n      approach that includes a toolkit, technical assistance, and training, organized around a\n      10-step process, that helps communities plan, implement, and evaluate the impact of their\n      programs that attempt to prevent these negative behaviors. This study will examine the\n      degree to which Getting To Outcomes helps Boys and Girls Clubs implement an evidence based\n      drug prevention program."

            "textblock": "As a nation, the U.S. invests heavily in community-based organizations to conduct\n      interventions, proven through research, to reduce the high rates of alcohol and drug use\n      among teens. Much less is invested in helping communities implement these programs with\n      quality.  Although many evidence-based programs exist to address alcohol and drug use,\n      communities face difficulty implementing them and achieving the same outcomes as\n      researchers. This \"gap\" is because resources are limited, prevention is complex, and\n      communities often lack the capacity\u2014or the knowledge, attitudes, and skills\u2014needed to\n      implement \"off the shelf\" programs well. Common ways to bridge this gap, such as information\n      dissemination, fail to change practice or outcomes at the local level in part because it\n      does not sufficiently address capacity of community practitioners. Therefore, building a\n      community's capacity is a method that could improve the quality of implementation and\n      outcomes. Getting To Outcomes (GTO) is an implementation support intervention shown to\n      improve the capacity of practitioners to conduct evidence-based programs, but its impact on\n      fidelity and youth outcomes has not been studied. The study\u2014Preparing to Run Effective\n      Prevention (PREP)\u2014will be a cluster randomized controlled trial using primary data from\n      middle school youth (990) and program staff from 33 cooperating Boys and Girls Clubs sites\n      (Sites) to assess how GTO impacts the fidelity, outcomes, and costs of an evidence-based\n      program to prevent alcohol and drug use (Project CHOICE, PC). All 33 sites will receive\n      training in PC. 16 Sites will conduct PC in a way typical of community-based organizations\n      (PC only); 17 Sites will conduct PC augmented by GTO, comprised of training, onsite\n      technical assistance, and a written GTO manual. The study will: (1) Assess the use of GTO\n      and compare Sites' capacity between PC+GTO and PC only; (2) Compare PC fidelity between\n      PC+GTO and PC only groups; (3) Compare alcohol and marijuana outcomes of  middle-school\n      youth in the PC+GTO (n=510) and PC only (n=480) groups; and (4) Assess the\n      cost-effectiveness of GTO' impact. To address these aims we will collect data on the\n      delivery and utilization of GTO (e.g., method of delivery, duration, topics); staff capacity\n      to implement research-based interventions; observations of program delivery (fidelity\n      monitoring); youth participants' use of, and attitudes towards, alcohol and marijuana via a\n      survey at baseline and 3 and 6 months follow-up; and costs of both PC alone and PC+GTO.\n      Analyses will examine differences between intervention (PC+GTO) and control (PC only) Sites'\n      capacity, PC fidelity, outcomes, and costs over time, accounting for clustering within site.\n      The PREP study could expand implementation research and serve as a model for how the\n      government and other agencies support strong implementation of evidence-based programs in a\n      wide array of domains. These outcomes are important to providing opportunities for youth to\n      become healthy and productive adults."

Capacity ratings are made at the program level since programs operate as a unit. The ratings are made using a structured interview with key program personnel. The Capacity Interview has 14 items (\"components\") tied to each of the ten steps of the GTO model, averaging to a Total Score. Each component has seven responses, described with specific observable behaviors, ranging from \"highly faithful\" to \"highly divergent\" from ideal prevention practice.",
