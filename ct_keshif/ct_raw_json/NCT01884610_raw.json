Those found to carry aneuploid cell clones at these time points will be asked for\n      a further 5\u221210ml blood sample at least twice \u2212 at the end of 24 months and 36 months\n      respectively.

Exp.Haem (2004)\n      32;122-30].  The employment of more sensitive methods such as iFISH and gene array analysis\n      to assess any permanent genetic changes, our primary objective, will make our study more\n      robust.\n\n      There will be two arms:\n\n      i)         Retrospective arm - the peripheral blood of unrelated donors who donated 3 to 5\n      years previously will be screened.\n\n      ii) Prospective arm - peripheral blood of unrelated donors will be examined prior to\n      donation and at 120 and 360 day's post-donation. In those found to have aneuploid changes at\n      these time points, there will be additional sampling at 24 and 36 months and if necessary\n      these donors will be followed up.\n\n      Each arm of the study will include 50 BM unrelated donors and 50 PBSC unrelated donors\n      giving a total sample population of around 200 unrelated donors. There will be one positive\n      control group of 50 patients with a range of haematological malignancies. The blood samples\n      taken from both BM and PBSC donors prior to donation will act as internal negative controls."
