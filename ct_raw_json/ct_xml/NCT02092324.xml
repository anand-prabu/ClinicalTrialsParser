  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate works in treating patients with
      chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) or atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). Ruxolitinib
      phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cells to reproduce. This trial also studies the genetic makeup of patients. Certain genes in
      cancer cells may determine how the cancer grows or spreads and how it may respond to
      different drugs. Studying how the genes associated with CNL and aCML respond to the study
      drug may help doctors learn more about CNL and aCML and improve the treatment for these
      diseases.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and
      atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) who have a hematologic response to ruxolitinib
      (ruxolitinib phosphate) (partial response [PR], complete response [CR], complete response,
      partial [CRp]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency of grade 3 or 4 hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events
      experienced by subjects during therapy with ruxolitinib.

      II. To determine whether hematologic responses correlate with certain types of mutations in
      colony stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) and reduction in mutant CSF3R allele burden in
      the peripheral blood.

      III. To determine the maximum clinical responses for each subject and the median duration of
      maximum clinical responses.

      IV. To determine the mean % reduction of spleen size, estimated by the longest dimension in
      the cranio-caudal axis as measured by ultrasound compare to baseline.

      V. To determine the mean % reduction of total symptom score as measured by a modified
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form version 2.0 (MPN-SAF) compared to start
      of study (day 1, cycle 1).

      VI. To determine overall survival in subjects who complete a minimum of 6 cycles.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) every other day, once daily (QD), or
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 courses (96 weeks) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 2 weeks and at 4-6
      weeks.
