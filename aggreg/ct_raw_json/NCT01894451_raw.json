            "textblock": "This research study is a pilot study, which tests the ability of an investigational compound\n      to be used in humans for further studies.  \"Investigational\" means that 89Zr-bevacizumab for\n      PET/CT imaging is being studied.  It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug\n      Administration) has not approved 89Zr-bevacizumab for PET/CT imaging for use in patients,\n      including people with your type of cancer.\n\n      89Zr-bevacizumab is a newly developed radiotracer.  Radiotracers are compounds or drugs that\n      are attached to small amounts of a radioactive substance.  The amount of the compound or\n      drug in a radiotracer is also very small.  Radiotracers are used to make images of processes\n      that are happening in the body, but they do not affect how the body works.  89Zr-bevacizumab\n      is made up of the drug bevacizumab and the radioactive substance zirconium-89 (89Zr).\n      89Zr-bevacizumab is used for an imaging procedure called positron emission\n      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).  This radiotracer has been used in other research\n      studies.  Information from those other research studies suggests that\n      89Zr-bevacizumab-PET/CT imaging may be able to measure new blood vessel formation to\n      determine where the cancer is in your body and if your cancer is being killed by\n      chemotherapy."

This is part of regular cancer care.\n\n        -  Physical exam, your doctor will examine your body, including measuring your height,\n           weight, and vital signs (blood pressure, body temperature, pulse rate and breathing\n           rate).  This is part of regular cancer care.\n\n        -  Blood tests (approximately 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for tests to check how well your\n           organs are functioning.  This is part of regular cancer care.\n\n        -  Blood pregnancy test will be performed for women who can become pregnant. About 1\n           teaspoon of blood will be drawn for the blood pregnancy test.

This is done as part of regular cancer care.\n\n      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will\n      begin the study treatment.  If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be\n      able to participate in this research study.\n\n      After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research\n      study:\n\n      Your primary oncologist will decide what chemotherapy you receive.\n\n      Before beginning preoperative chemotherapy (baseline):\n\n      Before beginning chemotherapy, you will undergo tests or procedures for the research study.\n      Some of these tests and procedures are part of regular cancer care and some are being\n      performed as part of the research study only.\n\n        -  FDG-PET/CT scan: Pictures of your organs will be taken using a PET (Positron Emission\n           Tomography) scanner.

FDG, a radioactive substance similar to glucose (or sugar), will be\n           injected into your vein using a needle prior to performing the PET/CT scan.  After the\n           injection, you will be asked to sit quietly for one hour to let the FDG absorb into the\n           body. After this hour, you will be asked to lie flat on your back for up to 50 minutes\n           while the PET and CT images are being taken.

If you have had this test within 14 days of study enrollment, you may or\n           may not have to have this test repeated.\n\n        -  MRI Scan: MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans of the breast will be taken. You will\n           receive an injection of a dye before the MRI.  You will be asked to lie flat on your\n           back in the scanner for up to 30 minutes for pictures to be taken.

Therefore, the research PET and research CT scans (89Zr-bevacizumab-PET/CT) will\n           be performed 3 to 4 days after the 89Zr-bevacizumab is injected into your vein.\n\n        -  This 89Zr-bevacizumab-PET/CT scan is part of research (in addition to the FDG-PET/CT\n           scan) and is not part of regular cancer care.\n\n        -  Vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate,\n           will be performed immediately before and then approximately 5, 30, and 60 minutes after\n           injection of 89Zr-bevacizumab and just before 89Zr-bevacizumab-PET/CT imaging.

Breast surgery is part of\n      regular cancer care.  During your surgery, tissue from your tumor will be removed and tested\n      for how well your cancer responded to treatment. This is part of regular cancer care.  If\n      there is enough tissue available after the tissue has been tested for how well your tumor\n      responded to treatment, some tissue will be taken for research.  If you are not able to\n      undergo breast surgery, then you will have a tumor biopsy similar to before starting and\n      after 2 cycles of chemotherapy."
