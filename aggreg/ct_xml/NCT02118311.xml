      This is a Simon's optimal two-stage phase II trial designed to estimate grade II-IV acute
      graft-versus-host diease (GVHD) after infusion of T regulatory (nTreg) in a fixed dose ratio
      to the combined CD3+ cell count of the two graft units in recipients of double UCB
      transplantation.  The nTreg cells (manufactured from a 3rd cord blood unit) are infused on
      day 0 at least 1 hour after the 2nd unit of the double umbilical cord blood (UCB)
      transplant.

      The nTreg cells require an 18 day (±2 days) lead time based on the planned transplant day.
      The combined CD3+ cell content from the two graft UCB units is enumerated upon thaw (day 0).
       The patient then receives the number of nTregs cells from the 3rd cord product to achieve a
      Treg:CD3+ cells ratio of 5:1.  The nTreg cell dose depends on the CD3+ cell content of the
      two graft UCB graft units, but it will not exceed the highest dose level safely tested in
      the ongoing University of Minnesota phase I Treg dose escalation study MT 2006-01.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be ≥18, but &lt; 70 years of age with no matched 5/6 or 6/6 sibling donor -
             patients ≥ 70 and ≤ 75 years of age may be eligible if they have a Co-Morbidity score
             ≤ 2 (Appendix II)

          -  Three UCB units composing the graft will be selected according to the current
             University of Minnesota umbilical cord blood graft selection algorithm.

          -  Each UCB unit must be matched at 4-6 HLA-A, B, DRB1 antigens with the recipient. This
             may include 0-2 antigen mismatches at the A or B or DRB1 loci.  Each unit must be a
             4-6 HLA-A, B, DRB1 antigen match to each other, not necessarily at the same loci they
             are matched to the recipient.

               -  Acute Leukemias: Must be in remission by morphology (&lt;5% blasts). Note
                  cytogenetic relapse or persistent disease without morphologic relapse is
                  acceptable. Also a small percentage of blasts that is equivocal between marrow
                  regeneration versus early relapse are acceptable provided there are no
