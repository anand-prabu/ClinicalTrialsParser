Patients with bone-only disease may be\n        considered eligible after discussion with Dr. Kenneth Cowan.\n\n        For Stage III disease, there must be no history of prior cytotoxic therapy.\n\n        Stage IV patients will be eligible if they have had prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or\n        hormonal therapy provided the regimen did not included adriamycin.  Patients will also be\n        eligible if they have been treated with one prior Phase I or II single chemotherapy agent\n        on a Medicine branch protocol.  Patients who have had prior radiation therapy may be\n        eligible providing there was not extensive radiation to the cardiac area.\n\n        There must be no history of previous malignancy except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer\n        (basal cell carcinoma) and cervical cancer in situ.\n\n        Performance status (Karnofsky scale) must be greater than 70.\n\n        WBC count greater than 4000/mm3 and platelet count 100,000/mm3, unless there is evidence\n        of bone marrow involvement with tumor.\n\n        Liver function tests (SGOT, Alk. Phosph., and T. Bilil) should be less than 1.5 times the\n        upper limits of normal, and serum creatinine should be less than 1.7 or creatinine\n        clearance should be greater than 45 ml/min unless these abnormalities are due to tumor\n        involvement.\n\n        The patient must give informed consent.\n\n        No pregnant patients may be entered on this study; all patients should be informed about\n        the need for contraception.\n\n        No history of other malignant neoplasms except for curatively treated basal cell skin\n        cancer or surgically cured carcinoma of the cervix in situ.\n\n        Patients must not be in poor medical or psychiatric risks because of nonmalignant systemic\n        disease which would preclude them being subjected to any treatments in this protocol.\n\n        Patients with a history of cardiac disease must have a normal ejection fraction by MUGA\n        Scan and have no angina.\n\n        Must not have evidence of CNS metastasis."
