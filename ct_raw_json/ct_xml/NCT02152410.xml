  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal colics are a common cause af acute intense pain in medical emergency settings
      requiring often the use of high level antalgics (opioid) to relief the patient.

      In the other hand, Acupuncture is well known widely for its therapeutic characteristics,
      especially in relieving pain.

      the aim of these study is to compare this two pain relieving techniques in patients
      consulting the emergency departement (ED) for acute onset renal colics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      acute onset pain is a frequent cause for consulting the ED (2/3 of patients). renal colics
      are a common cause for severe acute onset pain, we think approximatively 20% of patients
      consulting the ED for severe (VAS &gt; 70) acute onset pain have renal colics (RC).

      the guidelines for the treatment of severe RC recommend the association of two drugs: a
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAI) typically the Ketoprofen and an antalgic
      typically opioid (Morphine).

      but this one face many critics regarding its safety and tolerance, that's why we
      investigated other pain relief strategies such as acupuncture.

      acupuncture is one of the five branches of the traditional chinese medecine, it has proven
      its efficacity and safety in many conditions and in RC.

      the aim of these study is to assess the feasibility, the safety, and the tolerance of an
      acupuncture pain-relief strategy compared to the conventional one (intravenous opioids) in
      the treatment of severe acute onset RC in emergency departement settings.

    <description>the primary outcome is to assess the efficacity of acupuncture versus IV morphine expressed in VAS reduction during treatment.
if there is a reduction of more than 50% of the baseline VAS, than the treatment is considered efficient.</description>

    <description>during the 60 minutes of the treatment, we checked the patient for side effects:
for morphine: rush, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dyspnea...
for acupuncture: needle fracture, needle retention, muscular contractions... if there are no major side effects noted (vomiting, severe dizziness, allergic reaction, needle fracture) the treatment is considered safe.</description>
