  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral
      health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV
      and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by
      providing knowledge about the health, risk behaviors, and service utilization of a
      vulnerable and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public
      health risk in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this
      project will advance the delivery of a low-cost, potentially high impact intervention with
      implications for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues)
      where other disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for
      intervention.

      Specific Aim 1:  Compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction
      intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors,
      injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged,
      drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This aim will be accomplished through
      the random selection of high-risk rural women drug users from rural jails, screening and
      assessment for high-risk behavior, and random assignment to the HIV-Ed or MI-HIV
      intervention conditions. Follow-up interviews at 3, 6, and 12 months in the community
      post-release will examine changes in high-risk behavior. It is expected that MI-HIV
      participants will report significantly greater reductions in risky injection drug use
      practices, other drug use, and sex risk behaviors than women who participate in the HIV-Ed
      condition.

      Specific Aim 2: Examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health
      and behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at
      follow-up among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This aim
      will focus on community service utilization during the follow-up period by the intervention
      and education comparison group, and how health and behavioral health service utilization
      relates to patterns of HIV/HCV risk behavior. It is expected that MI-HIV participants will
      utilize more services due to increased motivation for treatment and treatment planning
      following the brief intervention.
