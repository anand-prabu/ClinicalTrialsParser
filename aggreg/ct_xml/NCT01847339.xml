  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effective relief of pain is of paramount importance to anyone treating patients
      undergoing surgery. Post-operative pain increases the possibility of post-surgical
      complications, raises the cost of medical care, and most importantly, interferes with
      recovery and return to normal activities of daily living. Therefore pain control is
      essential in the management of patients undergoing spinal surgery.Parenteral administration
      of narcotics has been the mainstay for postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing
      laminectomy and discectomy. Epidural and intrathecal opioids are also effective means of
      pain control in several major surgical interventions including spinal surgery. However, some
      of the side effects have limited their widespread use (eg, late-onset respiratory
      depression). Therefore, alternative measures of pain control including infiltration of
      paraspinal musculature with local anesthetics have been investigated with conflicting
      results. In situations such as laminectomies, where the epidural space is exposed as part of
      the surgical procedure, the application of absorbable gelatin sponge soaked in local
      anesthetics appears to be an alternative for providing postoperative analgesia. By
      investigating the probable analgesic effects of this method the investigators may relieve
      post laminectomy pain with minimal side effects and also costs.
