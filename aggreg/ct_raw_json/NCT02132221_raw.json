            "textblock": "This research is being done to better understand how to help patients who are not receiving\n      enough relief from opioid prescription medications for chronic non-cancer pain. Opioids are\n      a group of medications that includes morphine, oxycodone-,  hydrocodone-, etc. These\n      medications are also called narcotics. Research has shown that patients not benefiting from\n      their opioid prescription medication often feel better when they stop taking it. However,\n      stopping or reducing pain medications can be a difficult transition. Although they do not\n      have much benefit from their medication, many patients are afraid to stop because they feel\n      these medications are the only things giving them a bit of relief. Different strategies can\n      be used to help patients through the period of tapering and it is not clear which one is\n      best. The investigators will test a specific approach used during regular care in the\n      clinic: cognitive therapy."
