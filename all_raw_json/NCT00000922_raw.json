It is possible that a regimen\n      which is initially the most potent may not be optimal if it limits the effectiveness of\n      subsequent anti-HIV treatment regimens.\n\n      Patients will be randomized to one of three HAART treatment arms:\n\n        -  Arm 1 participants will receive one or two PIs plus two NRTIs.\n\n        -  Arm 2 participants will receive one NNRTI plus two NRTIs.\n\n        -  Arm 3 participants will receive one or two PIs plus an NNRTI plus one or two NRTIs.\n\n      Before randomization to a treatment arm, patients will be given the option of preselecting\n      the drugs they will use or allowing randomization to study-specified drugs. The\n      study-specified PIs will be indinavir (IDV), nelfinavir (NFV), or two PIs of patient and\n      doctor choice. The study-specified NNRTIs will be nevirapine (NVP) or efavirenz (EFV). The\n      study-specified NRTIs will be abacavir (ABC) plus lamivudine (3TC) or didanosine (ddI) plus\n      stavudine (d4T).\n\n      The study sites will provide ABC, 3TC, ddI, or d4T to all patients who are assigned to take\n      these medications. All other anti-HIV drugs for initial and subsequent treatment regimens\n      are obtained by clinician prescription. At Months 1 and 4 and then every 4 months\n      thereafter, patients will receive a medical history update, physical exam, and\n      questionnaire. Blood samples will also be drawn to measure CD4 cell count, viral load, and\n      genotypic antiretroviral resistance. Changes in treatment regimens may occur at any time."
