Thalidomide may stop the growth of melanoma by stopping blood\n      flow to the tumor. Combining chemotherapy with thalidomide may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness temozolomide plus thalidomide in\n      treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed during\n      surgery."

Patients\n      receive oral thalidomide daily for the entire 8-10 week course. Treatment continues in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Once the MTD is determined, additional\n      patients are accrued to receive treatment with temozolomide and thalidomide at the\n      recommended phase II dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for phase I and then an\n      additional 45 patients (15 with CNS disease, 30 without CNS disease) will be accrued for\n      phase II of this study within 18 months."
