This tool underwent refinement in 1980 with the original 60-item tool being tested in undergraduate male and females. Items correlating less than 0.30 were deleted. The final 40-item scale yielded an exceptionally high internal reliability (\u03b1 = 0.91) suggesting that a unitary common concept is evident for the obtained factor structure.
