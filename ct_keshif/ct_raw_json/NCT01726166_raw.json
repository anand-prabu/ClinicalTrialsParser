            "textblock": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is relatively common in infants, with an occurence rate of up\n      to 10%. It is more frequent in male and preterm newborn infants and can lead to significant\n      problems in infants including blood infections, kidney infections, and kidney scarring which\n      can affect how the kidneys work later in life.\n\n      Analysis of collected urine for the presence of bacteria or fungus is the only way to make a\n      certain UTI diagnosis. Urine culture results may take 24 to 48 hours to become available.\n      Sterile collection of urine can be achieved in newborn infants by urinary catheterization\n      (UC) where a catheter is passed through the urethra into the bladder, suprapubic aspiration\n      (SPA) where a needle is inserted into the bladder through the abdominal wall, or 'clean\n      catch' where urine is collected into a sterile bottle as the baby urinates during\n      preparation for UC. The main advantage of SPA is that it bypasses the bacteria that normally\n      resides in the urethral opening, thus minimizing the risk of contamination. Some studies\n      have suggested that SPA is better than UC for collecting urine in a sterile fashion in the\n      neonate due to the difficulty of doing sterile UC in small infants resulting in more\n      contaminated samples (also called a false-positive urine culture); there are some problems\n      with the way these studies were done so there is still no clear best choice. UC is commonly\n      used in many Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) as it is considered less invasive, can be\n      done by the nursing staff, and generally has a higher chance of obtaining urine. SPA is a\n      simple and safe alternative and, although some studies suggest that it is more painful than\n      UC, it it performed more quickly. The reported success rate for SPA is variable, but is\n      greatly increased when an ultrasound confirms urine in the bladder before doing the SPA. The\n      question remains: what is the best method for sterile collection of urine in newborns and\n      young infants? In this study, the investigators will try to answer this question by\n      collecting urine from infants admitted to our NICU using either ultrasound guided SPA or UC\n      and then comparing the contamination rates between these two methods.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that SPA will result in less contamination of urine samples.\n\n      The investigators also hypothesize that there will be more success in obtaining an adequate\n      urine sample (0.5 ml) by SPA, SPA will be quicker to perform, and that there will be no\n      difference in associated complication rates between SPA and UC."
