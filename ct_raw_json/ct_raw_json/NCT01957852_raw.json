            "textblock": "Introduction\n\n      Modern treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) combines an aggressive cytoreductive\n      surgery (CRS) of all macroscopic disease and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy\n      (HIPEC) performed at the time of surgery. It is considered a high risk procedure and\n      post-operative intra-abdominal bleeding is a major issue as it can delay recovery and\n      promote intra-abdominal infections. In most severe cases (10 to 20% of patients), a second\n      surgery to control the bleeding will be necessary. Major causes of bleeding are : radical\n      resection, extensive peritonectomy, length of surgery, massive transfusion and use of HIPEC.\n\n      To reduce the risk of intra-abdominal hemorrhage, many strategies have been tried and one of\n      these is the liberal use of FloSeal, but there is no data in this particular field of\n      interest. Over the last 18 months, the investigators have started to use FloSeal in all\n      their cases with large PC and they have observed a dramatic reduction in the rate of\n      reoperation for bleeding and probably secondarily, in the use of blood products, but this\n      has not been measured.\n\n      Hypothesis\n\n      FloSeal can reduce the risk of bleeding after CRS and HIPEC procedure.\n\n      Primary objective\n\n      To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can reduce the risk of reoperation after CRS and HIPEC\n      procedure in the treatment of PC.\n\n      Secondary objectives\n\n        -  To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can reduce operative blood loss.\n\n        -  To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can reduce the need of blood products after CRS and\n           HIPEC procedure.\n\n        -  To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can have an impact on other common surgical\n           complications (which can be indirectly bleeding related).\n\n        -  To evaluate if the use of FloSeal can have an impact on length of hospital stay."
