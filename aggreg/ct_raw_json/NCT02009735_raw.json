In\n      comparison with results from direct sequencing of Enterovirus 71 and Influenza Virus, the\n      investigators evaluate the performance of virosensor , including reproducibility,\n      sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reaction. The potential factors which may interfere with\n      the results would be investigated. With such technique, the investigators hope to make early\n      diagnosis and give Enterovirus 71 and Influenza Virus patients early treatment to reduce the\n      complications and case-fatality rate."
