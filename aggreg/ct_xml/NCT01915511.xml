    <textblock>
      This registry will collect data on the strategies used to achieve a diagnosis of Idiopathic
      Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and the treatment and management efforts applied throughout study
      follow-up, clinical outcome events and patient reported outcome data.  Blood samples will be
      collected periodically throughout the study for use in future research efforts.
