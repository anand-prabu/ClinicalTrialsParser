The visual loss of interest to be investigated is that\n      associated with macular edema (prior to and following laser photocoagulation treatment) and\n      that associated with panretinal photocoagulation.  The evaluation will be performed with\n      psychophysical testing, i.e., static perimetry and contrast sensitivity function.  Of\n      particular interest, the mechanisms of visual loss associated with macular edema (prior to\n      and following laser photocoagulation) will be further investigated.  Photoreceptor-mediated\n      visual loss will be assessed by measurements of the Stiles-Crawford effect.  Visual loss\n      mediated by post-receptoral retinal changes will be assessed by measuring the Westheimer\n      spatial desensitization/sensitization effect."
