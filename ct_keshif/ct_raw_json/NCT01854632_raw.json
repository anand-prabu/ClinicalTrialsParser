A\n      total of 1,761 healthy children will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio of LAIV to placebo.\n\n      For evaluation of efficacy, passive and active surveillance will be conducted weekly\n      throughout the study to identify outcomes among vaccinated subjects. Children meeting the\n      protocol-defined clinical case definition will have a nasal swab and throat swab specimen\n      collected for testing by rRT-PCR for evidence of influenza virus infection.\n\n      A subset of 100 children will be additionally included in a substudy designed to evaluate\n      virologic evidence of LAIV replication. As such, nasal and throat swab specimens will be\n      collected on day 0 (prior to vaccination), as well as on post-vaccination days 2, and 4 from\n      all subjects included in the substudy. These specimens will be tested for presence of\n      wild-type and vaccine virus. Additionally, a more detailed assessment of vaccine\n      reactogenicity will be made among these children by actively collecting solicited and\n      unsolicited reactions at each study visit for the week post vaccination (days 2 and 4)."
