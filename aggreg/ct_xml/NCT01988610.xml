      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of cortisol,a stress hormone in the body,
      on memory and attention in people with a history of depression, but who are not in the midst
      of a current depressive episode.

      Cortisol may affect parts of the brain associated with memory and attention directly. It may
      also indirectly affect the brain by controlling how much insulin the body makes. Insulin is
      thought to impact cognition by changing the amount of sugar available in certain parts of
      the brain.

      The investigators are studying this question by giving patients a medication, called
      Mifepristone, which reduces cortisol's effect on the brain. The investigators will compare
      results from several groups of people, including differences between men and women, and
      between those with and without insulin resistance.

      The specific aims of this study are threefold:

        1. To evaluate the association between glucose utilization and neuropsychological
           performance on tests of verbal memory and attention among patients with a history of
           depression, but who are euthymic, at baseline;

        2. To evaluate changes in neuropsychological test performance among patients with a
           history of depression and who have insulin resistance who are treated with open-label
           mifepristone and,

        3. To explore interactions between changes in patients' glucose tolerance profiles and
           changes in verbal memory and attention. An exploratory aim is to explore the
           interaction of changes in cortisol awakening response and changes in verbal memory  and
           attention within subjects with and without IGT, as well as the potential mediating
           effects of gender.
