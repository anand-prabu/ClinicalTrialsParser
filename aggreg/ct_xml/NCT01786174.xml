  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Gilenya, also known as fingolimod, is safe
      and tolerable in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the acute safety and tolerability of oral
      administration of Gilenya (fingolimod) 0.5mg daily vs. matched oral placebo administered
      daily.

      The primary outcome measure will be safety and tolerability; safety will be assessed by the
      occurrence of adverse events and clinically meaningful changes in vital signs,
      ophthalmologic examination, physical examination, electrocardiogram and standard clinical
      laboratory blood tests, and tolerability will be defined as the ability of subjects to
      complete the entire 4-week study.

      The secondary outcome measure will be the measured effect of the treatment on circulating
      lymphocyte populations in patients with ALS.

      Exploratory outcome measures will include the rate of decline of the ALS Functional Rating
      Scale (Revised) (ALSFRS-R) and Slow Vital Capacity (VC) during the course of treatment.

      This study will be conducted in subjects who meet the El Escorial criteria of possible,
      laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS.  At
      screening, eligible subjects must be at least 18 years old, must have an SVC ≥ 65% of
      predicted capacity for age, height and gender, and must provide written informed consent
      prior to screening.  Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and those not taking riluzole,
      and women of child-bearing age at screening are eligible for inclusion as long as they meet
      specific protocol requirements.

      Subjects will remain on randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment until the
      Week 4 visit.  Each randomized subject will also have a Week 8 Follow-up Telephone Interview
      to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications and to administer the
      ALSFRS-R.
