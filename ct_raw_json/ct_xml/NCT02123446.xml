    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different preparations of an antibiotic called
      cephalexin in capsules to determine if they are essentially the same. The study has two
      periods. Participants will receive one preparation of cephalexin in each period. At least 7
      hours will pass between the study periods. The study is expected to last about 2 days for
      each participant, not including screening or follow-up.
