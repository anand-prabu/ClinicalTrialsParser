The test product will contain\n      minimum 1 billion CFU (colony forming units) of probiotic per serving. The placebo product\n      is an identical product except for the absence of probiotics.\n\n      The study includes 3 months (90 days) of intervention period. The study product will be\n      consumed daily in the evening together with a meal.\n\n      The consumption of the study products will be taken under the surveillance of the parents.\n\n      During the entire intervention period the subjects are not allowed to consume any probiotic\n      products other than the study products supplied to them by the study personnel.\n\n      Data on infections will be recorded in a diary, filled in and administered by the parents\n      and diary recorded by referring physician (on-call log).\n\n      All infections are to be diagnosed by the local physician. The incidence of infections will\n      be analyzed based on the information recorded in the diaries (parent's & physician's)."
