Treatment\n      period will comprise of 4 treatment regimens each consisting of a baseline assessment and a\n      treatment regime (Days -1 to 9). The participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4\n      treatment sequence groups (ADBC, BACD, CBDA, and DCAB) based on a computer-generated\n      randomization schedule and will receive the following 4 treatments in the order specified by\n      the randomization: Treatment A (JNJ-54861911, 50 milligram (mg) once daily for 7 days plus\n      moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment B (JNJ-54861911, 150 mg once daily for 7\n      days plus moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment C (JNJ-54861911-matched placebo\n      once daily for 7 days plus moxifloxacin-matched placebo on Day 7); Treatment D\n      (JNJ-54861911-matched placebo once daily for 7 days plus moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day 7).\n      Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at least 6 - 10 days.
