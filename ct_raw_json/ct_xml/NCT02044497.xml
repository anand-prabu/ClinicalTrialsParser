  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxycodone is an oral opioid analgesic that is most commonly prescribed for the management of
      pain in post-operative patients at Boston Children's Hospital. Oxycodone has been widely
      used in adults and children to relieve post-operative pain. However, its pharmacokinetics
      (what it does in the body) and pharmacodynamics (how it works) have not been well
      established in children. Some children, because of their specific genetic make-up, may
      metabolize the drug more quickly and therefore may be at risk for more side effects in the
      commonly prescribed dose. We would like to find out more about how this drug is absorbed,
      metabolized and excreted in children. In order to study these aspects, we would like to give
      oxycodone to surgical patients at Boston Children's Hospital then measure its metabolic
      activity and also perform a genetic analysis. The genetic testing is specifically to analyze
      the following genotypes only: cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4),
      which represent the differences in cytochrome P450 metabolism of oxycodone.

    <description>An orogastric tube will be placed in the stomach (placement verified by routine accepted clinical guidelines) under anesthesia as is part of standard routine clinical care to remove gastric contents. The same orogastric tube will be used for intragastric liquid oxycodone administration in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg before the surgical incision. This weight-adjusted dose of 0.1 mg/kg is administered as per standard clinical dosing guidelines at Boston Children's Hospital.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A total of 68 generally healthy, opioid-naive children, aged 0-6 years, scheduled as
             in-patient surgery for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement/revision or Craniotomy
             (Neurosurgery service), Cleft lip/palate repair (plastic surgery service) and
             hypospadias repair or ureteral urethral reimplantation (genitourinary surgery
             service) will be enrolled in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children will be excluded if they are currently taking any medications which are
             CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors/inducers or have a history of allergy or hypersensitivity
             to oxycodone, have any condition that might interfere with GI absorption,
             distribution, hepatic metabolism or renal excretion of r oxycodone, or a diagnosis of
             sleep apnea or impaired respiratory reserve.
