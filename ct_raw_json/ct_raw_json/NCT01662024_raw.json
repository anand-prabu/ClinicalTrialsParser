The FDA cleared OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing\n      System (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, TX) offers the physician the ability to restrict gastric\n      size by approximating tissue endoluminally via an incisionless/per-oral approach. The use of\n      this system has the potential to reduce the complications associated with current surgical\n      approaches while effecting the desired gastric restriction. The primary objective is to\n      collect data on the use of the OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System (Apollo Endosurgery,\n      Inc. Austin, Texas) for gastric tissue approximation during primary gastric restrictive\n      procedures."
