We also want to see if bidet use is effective in lowering the\n      incidence of urinary tract infections in this high risk population.\n\n      Functional impairment around toileting has been shown to negatively impact quality of life\n      (QOL) for both patients and their caregivers. We hope to learn if the use of bidet will\n      improve QOL in this population.\n\n      Urinary tract infections increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in these populations.\n      Specifically the risk of hospitalization, sepsis, kidney failure and other complications.\n      There are not currently effective forms of non-pharmaceutical prevention. Bidets are safe,\n      inexpensive and hygienic. Individuals with functional impairment often have difficulty\n      maintaining their hygiene due to frailty and functional limitations. It is our hope that\n      addressing these issues will lead to a reduced incidence of UTI."
