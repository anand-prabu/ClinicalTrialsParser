            "textblock": "Gastric cancer is the first cause of death in Chile and the second worldwide. Currently, no\n      screening methods are available for early detection of gastric cancer at population level.\n      The only available test is serum levels of pepsinogen I/II for gastric atrophy, a precursor\n      lesion only for intestinal type with low risk to progress to gastric cancer. The\n      investigators' previous work, supported by FONDECYT (National Council for Research and\n      Technology) and FONIS (National Council for Research and Development of Human Health) both\n      from the Government of Chile led us to discover a potential biomarker for early detection of\n      gastric cancer, Reprimo, a tumor suppressor gene related to p53 in the arrest of G2-M of the\n      cell cycle (Clin Cancer Res. 2008;14:6264-9). Here, the investigators propose to evaluate\n      plasmatic detection of Reprimo in conjunction with gastric atrophy markers and H.pylori\n      detection to establish a novel screening and triage strategy for early detection of gastric\n      cancer. The aims are i) to determine sensitivity and specificity for Reprimo in the\n      detection of gastric cancer in a high-risk population evaluated by upper gastrointestinal\n      endoscopy (1,000 males, 30-74 y.o. low income, symptomatic or asymptomatic) and ii) to\n      characterize at clinical, pathological and molecular level cases of gastric cancer\n      identified and non-identified by direct detection of Reprimo along with atrophy, H.pylori\n      and clinical markers. With this information, the investigators will develop an algorithm for\n      screening and triage evaluating predictive values of plasmatic detection of Reprimo versus\n      atrophy & H.pylori detection and clinical data in a general population (3,000 male/female,\n      40-70 y.o.) from a high-risk area for gastric cancer in Chile. In this step the\n      investigators will evaluate also acceptability, efficacy and efficiency of the proposed\n      algorithm. In this proposal the investigators aim to develop a commercial kit to be used in\n      primary screening and non-invasive triage for early detection of gastric cancer. This kit\n      will be cost-effective and more accessible to the general population. In addition, the\n      investigators would like to expand the investigators' current patent already submitted to\n      INAPI and propose royalties to biomedical diagnostic companies for the use of the\n      investigators' product at international level."
