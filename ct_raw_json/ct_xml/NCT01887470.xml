          -  Patients with galactosemia (galactose-sensitive diet).

          -  Patients known to be hypersensitive to any of the components of lactulose for oral
             solution.

          -  Patients with an abnormality on screening blood work or vital sign assessments that,
             in the Investigator's judgment, may pose a significant risk including those
             pertaining to dehydration or electrolyte shifts.

          -  Patients with a history of impaired renal function.

          -  Patients with current or recent history of hypotension, as defined by the
             Investigator.

             colitis, toxic megacolon, ileus or previous colonic surgery.

          -  Patients on lactulose therapy or receiving any treatment for chronic constipation.

          -  Be pregnant or nursing.

          -  Patients with known large polyps or flat polyps (i.e. polyps requiring electrocautery

          -  Patients less than 18 years of age.

          -  Inability to understand the requirements of the study or be unwilling to provide
             written informed consent (as evidenced by signature on an informed consent document
