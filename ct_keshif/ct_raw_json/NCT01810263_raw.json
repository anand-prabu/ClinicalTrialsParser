Stroke may compound these problems because of\n      physical and mental incapacity, problems with perception and communication, and swallowing\n      disorders. The full extent of undernutrition and its independent contribution to stroke\n      outcome is not presently known. It is also not known whether it can be corrected, and\n      whether doing so would improve the outcome. The aim of this study is therefore to describe\n      the efficacy of Intensive Nutritional Supplement in Patient with Stroke."
