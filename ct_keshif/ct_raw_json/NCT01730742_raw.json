It is predicted that sleep deprivation will affect circulating neutrophil\n      activity, and do so via affects on DNA methylation. It is also predicted that sleep\n      deprivation will up-regulate ghrelin, and down-regulate circulating oxytocin. Finally, it is\n      predicted that sleep deprivation  will increase participants' tendencies to pick larger\n      portions of food, and also increase their tendency to purchase foods that are more caloric\n      in a mock supermarket scenario."
