  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to document the demographic and clinical characteristics and
      the long-term clinical outcomes of patients who require a total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      The hypothesis is that MAKO® robot assisted surgery replacing one or two compartments of the
      knee joint has 10 year implant survival and clinical outcomes that are equivalent to other
      knee replacement systems.

    <description>The American Knee Society Score is an assessment and questionnaire that provides a rating of the pain, function, range of motion, and knee joint stability. It is subdivided into a knee score that rates only the knee joint itself and a functional score that rates the patient's ability to walk and climb stairs.</description>
