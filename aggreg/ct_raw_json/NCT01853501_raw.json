In this study the investigators are aiming to\n      determine whether the CD29+/CD44+ human Adipose Derived Stem Cells could later enable\n      ovaries produce mature oocytes."

The serum of each patient were kept and sent for laboratory test before\n      the surgery. 100ml fat was harvested from the abdomen of POF patient using abdominal fat\n      abortion. And ADSC were isolated and cultured in vitro using autologous serum. The\n      biomarkers of ADSC, CD29 and CD44, were detected in the ADSC cultures using Flow cytometry\n      detection. The ADSC were then transplanted directly into bilateral ovaries when cells reach\n      a density of 5-10\u00d7106. The clinical conditions of patients were examined at 1, 2, 4 and 8\n      weeks after the transplantation. Ovarian functions were evaluated by follicle diameter and\n      sexual hormone levels. The follicle number was counted and radiology data were kept for\n      future analysis. To ensure high rate of pregnancy, intercourse under medical guidance may be\n      suggested and hormone replacement treatment may be taken to help the patients conceive.\n\n      Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum FSH,LH,E2 levels, recurrence of Menstruation, Antral follicle\n      diameter,and pregnancy."
