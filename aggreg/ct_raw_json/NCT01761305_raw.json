            "textblock": "Today, bracing is used to prevent progression of idiopathic scoliosis in children.\n\n      The evidence for bracing and physical activity for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis is\n      poor. Only one low quality study has compared bracing with physical exercise, showing no\n      statistical differences in the reduction or progression of scoliosis curves between the\n      groups. To draw valid conclusions about the effectiveness of postural specific physical\n      exercise and brace therapeutic interventions compared to a self mediated activity exercise\n      group, a randomized controlled trial research design will be used.\n\n      Preliminary data suggests that approximately 8 hours of night-time bracing with an\n      over-corrective brace is as effective as bracing during 23 hours per day. Night-time bracing\n      is attractive since you wear the brace a limited amount of time.\n\n      Several theories propose that during the adolescent period of skeletal growth, bone\n      deformation may occur due to a combination of asymetrical growth plate activity, vertebral\n      body weakness or an imbalance of muscle forces and joint flexibility. An association between\n      low bone mineral density and idiopathic scoliosis has been reported in the literature.\n      Adequate physical activity levels is a requirement for normal growth and development during\n      childhood and adolescents. It is well documented that physical exercise is associated with\n      improvements in not only muscle strength, aerobic fitness and motor development but also\n      bone density which may help decrease the risk of osteopenic related bone deformation.\n\n      Patients included in the study will be randomized to one of three groups. Each of the three\n      groups will receive a physical activity prescription according to World Health Organisation\n      recommendations. One group will additionally wear a hyper-corrective night-time brace. One\n      group will additionally perform postural scoliosis-specific exercises. Patients not wanting\n      to be randomized to the alternative treatments in the clinical trial will receive bracing\n      which is the current standard treatment offered.\n\n      The purpose of the study is to compare the risk of curve progression in the different\n      groups. Curve progression is measured on x-rays. Participation in the study will last until\n      the curve has progressed, or until cessation of skeletal growth. Participants with braces\n      will be instructed to wear the brace 8 hours per night. Participants receiving scoliosis\n      specific training will receive 3x90 minute physiotherapist guided sessions with an\n      additional session provided every 6 months for the entirety of the study. All participants\n      will be recommended to be physically active at least 60 minutes per day."
