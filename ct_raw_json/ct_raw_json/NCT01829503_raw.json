Patients will receive decitabine 20mg/m2 in 100mL normal saline (NS)\n      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour daily for five days, followed by cytarabine 100mg/m2 in 1000\n      mL normal saline (NS) as a continuous IV infusion over 24 hours for 5 days.  Treatment\n      should be discontinued or delayed for any of the following during the treatment period: a\n      rise in serum creatinine > 2x patient baseline or upper limit of normal (whichever is\n      higher) unless there is an identifiable reversible etiology, or ALT, AST or total bilirubin\n      > 5x upper limit of normal, and should be held until resolution below these parameters.\n      There are no parameters for dose reduction.\n\n      Patients who have persistent disease on post-treatment bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, will\n      undergo a repeat cycle of induction with decitabine followed by cytarabine as outlined\n      above.\n\n      Supportive care including blood product transfusions, antiemetic medications antiviral and\n      antifungal medications, or empiric antibiotics may be used at the clinical discretion of the\n      provider.\n\n      Maintenance therapy Patients in complete response (CR) will proceed to decitabine\n      maintenance therapy, where each treatment will be decitabine 20mg/m2 in 100mL normal saline\n      (NS) intravenously (IV) over 1 hour daily for five days administered in the outpatient\n      setting.  Maintenance treatments will be continued until disease relapse.  Maintenance\n      treatments can be administered as an outpatient at the Hillman Cancer Center, or at a\n      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) facility that is able to administer\n      chemotherapy under the supervision of an Oncologist\n\n      Evaluations during maintenance Phase:\n\n      During maintenance therapy, complete blood count (CBC) w/ diff/platelets, CMP (Na, K, Cl,\n      carbon dioxide (CO2), glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Cr, Ca, Total Protein, Albumin,\n      AST, ALT, Alk Phos, Total Bilirubin) will be checked each cycle on day 14 [+/- 4 days].\n\n      Within 7 days of start of new cycle, study visits will include physical exam, adverse events\n      assessment, CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).\n\n      Maintenance cycles will be 28 days [+/- 7 days].  Cycles can be held up to 4 weeks [28\n      days]. For start of new cycle, any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity possibly, probably\n      or definitely related to decitabine therapy must resolve to grade 2 or baseline.\n\n      In addition the following lab parameters must be met to start a new cycle of maintenance:\n\n      Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > or = 1000/mm3 Platelets >/= 50,000/mm3 AST or ALT < 2 x\n      Uppler Limit of Normal (ULN) Total billirubin < 2 x ULN Serum creatinine < 2x patient\n      baseline or upper limit of normal (whichever is higher)\n\n      [If lab parameters are not met for start of cycle, these labs will be checked a minimum of\n      once per week].  If start of new cycle is held for more than 4 weeks [28 days], the subject\n      will be off treatment.\n\n      Other reasons for delay in treatment should be discussed with the Principal Investigator."
