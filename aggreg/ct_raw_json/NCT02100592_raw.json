These functional\n      limitations can be significantly alleviated by treatment neurorehabilitation, particularly\n      if this is established early. It has been shown that treatment of vertical integration in\n      patients in a vegetative state or minimally conscious state can improve the level of\n      supervision and positive influence on rehabilitation. Therefore, there are sufficient\n      indications that anticipate the treatment of vertical integration, since the phase of\n      hospitalization in ICUs, may improve the functional outcome of the patient."
