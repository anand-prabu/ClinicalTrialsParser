            "textblock": "Chronic urticaria can be defined as the occurrence of widespread daily or almost daily\n      wheals for at least 6 weeks, which may be accompanied by angioedema. While the wheals are\n      transient, the resolution of angioedema is slower than wheals and could take up to 72 hours.\n      The natural course of chronic urticaria is self-limited, with spontaneous remissions and\n      occasional relapses. The investigators calculated a 0.6% (95% CI(Confidence Interval):\n      0.4-0.8) prevalence in a population study. It has a great impact on patients' quality of\n      life. In a recent national survey on patients attending Allergy Department, chronic\n      urticaria was the disease with greater impact on mental quality of life out of all allergic\n      diseases.\n\n      In spite of the high morbidity of this disease and the impact in quality of life, there is\n      no available treatment. Last guidelines recommend initiating treatment with antihistamine\n      and if there is no response to increase the dose off-label up to four-fold; systemic\n      corticosteroids are also recommended in short tapering and if no response, the only\n      treatment with clinical evidence to be employed is cyclosporine. As additional data, the\n      treatment cost of this disease has been calculated in 2047$/year.\n\n      In past years it has been employed the monoclonal humanized anti-Immunoglobulin IgE (iGE)\n      antibody (Omalizumab) to treat moderate to severe asthma with good results. The rationale\n      for this approach in chronic urticaria  is that Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to\n      the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) which decreases the FceRI expression on the surface\n      of mast cells and basophils  so that immunoglobulin G cross linking of the alpha subunit and\n      basophil degranulation is prevented.The hypothesis the investigators are working on is that\n      monoclonal IgE antibody Omalizumab could be effective in controlling chronic urticaria\n      symptoms in patients non respondent to conventional therapy. The investigators hypothesize\n      that Omalizumab is able to revert the basophil or mast cell activation present in chronic\n      urticaria."

For that purpose, The investigators will perform a Multicenter double-\n      blinded, placebo- controlled, randomized cross-over (2x2) trial. The investigators will\n      include 20 patients including both female and male adults non respondent to antihistamines\n      at supra therapeutic dose. Efficacy will be evaluated through the Urticaria Activity Score 7\n      (UAS7), Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life validated questionnaire, patients' symptoms card\n      and use of medication. Dropouts in each treatment group will be also evaluated. The\n      investigators will also record leave days because of urticaria and Emergency Department\n      visits, as well as adverse reactions during treatment.\n\n      The present study would allow to offer to the Health System an evidence to evaluate the\n      convenience or not to approve the use of Omalizumab for the new indication of chronic\n      urticaria treatment. It is important to take into account that in the present study the\n      investigators will include both autoimmune and non-autoimmune urticaria, since the efficacy\n      could differ between both urticaria types. In the same way, the Health Authorities (AEMPS)\n      would have independent additional information obtained through adequate methodology in the\n      case that a new indication is requested. The investigators also want to stress that in the\n      near future the company that manufactures this antibody could ask for a new indication for\n      chronic urticaria.\n\n      A third outcome expected is to offer information on the lasting effect of the drug that is\n      symptoms' free weeks after the dose. This information would be provided from the washing\n      period data and from  those patients who were allocated of placebo after the active drug\n      arm. This would give much needed information on the best dosing scheduling protocol."
