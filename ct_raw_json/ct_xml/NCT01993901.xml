  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to prospectively assess if CSRT led telephone follow up
      after treatment with lung SBRT has an impact on patient symptom burden as assessed by ESAS
      scores.

      Design:

      The design of this study is a randomized control trial. The study population will include
      patients treated with lung SBRT at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre (OCC) over a specified 1
      year time period who have consented to participating in the study.

      Methods:

      Patients who consent to the study will be randomized into either the control group or
      intervention group.  Simple randomization will be completed using a computer-generated
      random number table.  Baseline ESAS scores will be collected on the last day of radiation
      treatment for both groups.  Patients in the control group will have the standard follow up
      plan as outlined earlier (CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis prior to follow-up with the
      radiation oncologist 4 months after the completion of their treatment) and will be asked to
      complete a questionnaire to assess their opinions regarding follow up during their clinic
      appointment.  Patients in the intervention group will be telephoned by the CSRT 4-6 weeks
      after completion of their treatment to assess any symptoms.  A second follow up telephone
      call will be made at 12 weeks post treatment if required in order to address treatment
      related side effects that were identified during the first call and any interventions that
      were recommended.  When the patient returns to clinic for their first regularly scheduled
      follow-up appointment, ESAS will be completed as well as a questionnaire to assess their
      opinions regarding their follow up.

      Inclusion criteria:

      â€¢ Any patient treated with lung SBRT over a specified one year time frame.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Patients who are not 18 years of age or greater

        2. Patients whose first language is not English and require translation.

        3. Patients who have poor hearing and find it difficult to carry on a telephone
           conversation
