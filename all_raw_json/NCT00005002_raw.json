Patients with a plasma HIV-1 RNA level less\n      than or equal to 2,000 copies/ml at Week 8 are randomized to receive Remune or Incomplete\n      Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) at Week 9. Patients who do not achieve a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of\n      less than or equal to 2,000 copies/ml at Week 8 are not randomized and are terminated from\n      the study. These patients are eligible to receive funding for up to a 3-month supply of\n      nelfinavir (Viracept) and Combivir. Randomized patients receive Remune or IFA at Week 9 and\n      approximately every 12 weeks thereafter until study completion (when the last patient\n      reaches Week 48). Patients are considered virologic failures if they (1) fail to achieve a\n      virologic response by Week 48 or (2) after achieving a virologic response, have a virologic\n      relapse. Regardless of their previous response status, patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level\n      increases to greater than 2,000 copies/ml while they are receiving protocol-specified HAART\n      are eligible to receive salvage therapy and continue to receive Remune or IFA until study\n      completion. Study visits occur at screening, Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, 9, 12, and then every 4\n      weeks thereafter until the last patient reaches Week 48. Patients who complete this study\n      are eligible to participate in a rollover study."
