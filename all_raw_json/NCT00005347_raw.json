The secular trend and longitudinal analyses also included data that\n      were collected during the Cycle III Offspring/Spouse studies in 1984-88.  Of particular\n      interest were dietary variables which play a major role in serum total cholesterol and\n      lipoprotein regulation.  Additional dietary variables which were associated with major\n      cardiovascular risk factors ((elevated) blood pressure, glucose (in)tolerance, (excess) body\n      weight or physical (in)activity, and smoking) or that may predict CHD endpoints were\n      included in the analyses.  The potential confounding effects or interactions between dietary\n      and risk factor variables were considered.  Separate analyses were carried out in males and\n      females."
