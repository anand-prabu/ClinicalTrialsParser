The effect of L-thyroxine\n      replacement treatment on serum lipid and atherosclerosis is controversial in hypothyroid\n      patients, especially in those with mild or moderate subclinical hypothyroidism. The present\n      study was designed to investigate whether L-thyroxine replacement was effective in improving\n      serum lipid profiles and retarding atherosclerosis progress."
