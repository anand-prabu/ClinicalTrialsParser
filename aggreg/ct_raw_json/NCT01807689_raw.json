This is\n      not a treatment study, but a pilot study to confirm diagnostic ability of a panel of\n      salivary biomarkers. All enrolled subjects must be classified as having both oral and ocular\n      sicca symptoms without another autoimmune/connective tissue disease (Appendix 2). At the\n      University of California in Los Angeles, using molecular techniques, we will quantify\n      discriminatory biomarkers in saliva collected from enrolled subjects, who are also being\n      evaluated as part of their clinical care using the standard diagnostic tests of the 2002\n      AECG criteria. We also will test the performance of these biomarkers to predict the\n      diagnosis of pSS according to the AECG criteria, as these are the most widely used tests to\n      diagnose pSS and assess disease activity worldwide."
