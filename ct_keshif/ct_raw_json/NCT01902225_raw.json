Participants will be followed throughout therapy and all adverse\n      events recorded, graded, and given likelihood of relevance to study therapies.  Toxicity\n      will be graded by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.\n\n      Secondary:\n\n        -  Response will be assessed by a global response score integrating change in skin disease\n           as measured by the modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) score, change in\n           lymph node size, change in visceral disease, and changes in peripheral blood S\u00e9zary\n           cells by flow cytometry.  CR/PR assignment requires confirmatory assessment in 4 weeks.\n            Skin scores, clinical lymph node, liver and spleen exam, and S\u00e9zary cell count\n           assessment will occur on Day 1 of each cycle.  Contrasted CT scan of the neck, chest,\n           abdomen and pelvis will be performed at screening for all patients. In patients with\n           lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly at screening, contrasted CT scans of the neck,\n           chest, abdomen, and pelvis will occur at the end of every third cycle of therapy,\n           within 1 week of cycle 8 completion, and every 6 months for one year after maximal\n           response.  All patients will have contrasted CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and\n           pelvis at the time of concern for disease progression in lymph nodes and/or viscera.TTR\n           is the time of the first romidepsin dose to the time of documented objective response\n           (PR/CR).  DOR is the time from first objective response (PR or CR) until disease\n           progression.\n\n        -  TTP will be measured from the time of the first romidepsin dose until disease\n           progression.\n\n        -  Pruritus will be assessed monthly using a 100 mm visual analog scale.  Quality of life\n           will be assessed monthly by FACT-G, Skindex-29, and ItchyQOL questionnaires.\n\n      Exploratory:\n\n      Skin lesions will be punch biopsied (two contiguous 5mm biopsies) prior to beginning therapy\n      as standard care of care.  Any leftover tissue will be collected for research with consent\n      of patient.  Optional single 5mm punch biopsies will be obtained on day 15 of Cycle 2 after\n      infusion of romidepsin, and at disease relapse."
