Phase II CBT will emphasize continued therapist prescribed in-session and out-of-session exposure tasks (developed with patient) and continued patient cognitive-affective processing of exposure sessions with therapist, with no instruction on new skills or therapeutic strategies. Therapists will be encouraged to discuss clinical status with patients, psychiatrists, and PIs to allow for treatment integration (e.g., psychiatrist could increase the dose of SRT, or not, depending on whether the patient Is making sufficient progress in CBT)."
