  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of BEHHS is first to assess the baseline sub-clinical disease in a population of
      Baptist Health Employees who have Metabolic Syndrome, a known contributor to cardiovascular
      disease. Second, the investigators wish to encourage a healthy lifestyle through
      personalized nutrition and fitness advice, delivered as part of a web based program, which
      will in turn lead to increases in heart healthy behaviors such as increased consumption of
      heart healthy foods, increased exercise initiation, and more positive attitudes about
      health. To assess this, the investigators plan to randomize 200 employees with Metabolic
      Syndrome to either the new web-based diet and lifestyle program, or to care-as-usual, which
      is the  currently offered MyWellnessAdvantage and WebMD websites. The investigators
      hypothesize that the web-based group will show greater improvements in physical health (such
      as weight loss, cholesterol reduction, etc.) as well as increased consumption of heart
      healthy foods, exercise initiation, and quality of sleep as measured by surveys administered
      at the 4,8, and 12 month follow-up appointments.
