    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies intravital microscopy for identifying tumor vessels in
      patients with stage IA-IV melanoma that is being removed by surgery. New imaging procedures,
      such intravital microscopy, may determine the extent of melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of performing intravital microscopy on accessible human
      melanoma tumors during their standard course of treatment (i.e., wide local excision). (Part
      I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the blood flow velocity of the tumor vessels and tissue penetration of
      fluorescein (fluorescein sodium) as a marker of tumor vessel permeability. (Part II)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorescein sodium intravenously (IV) followed by intravital microscopic
      observation over 10-15 minutes during excision of the melanoma.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of =&lt; 2

          -  Have measurable disease in their skin by direct visualization (visible lesion
             typically &gt; 0.5 cm in maximal diameter); to perform a microscopic observation, the
             lesion will have to be visible by the naked eye, lined-up visually, and be able to
             interface with the microscope objective; a melanoma lesion that is smaller than 0.5
             cm in diameter would present several obstacles to obtaining a reliable microscopic
             observation in the operating room; therefore, a visible lesion, at a minimum of 0.5
             cm in diameter, is proposed for this study

          -  Melanoma tumor that requires a wide local excision in the operating room; this may
             include any stage of melanoma from Stage IA to Stage IV that requires a wide excision
             in the operating room

          -  Subject or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved
             written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure

          -  To determine any sensitivity to fluorescein, subject must have a skin prick test
             preoperatively (at the time of the preoperative visit and after signed informed
             consent for entry into this clinical trial is given); a negative skin prick test to
             fluorescein is an inclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Melanoma deposit is deemed inaccessible to microscopic observation during the
             operative procedure (i.e., lesion is less than 0.5 cm or is not clearly visible to
             the naked eye)

          -  Renal dysfunction as defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 70

          -  Any known allergy or prior reaction to fluorescein; also, a positive skin prick test
             to fluorescein is considered an exclusion criteria and the patient would not be
             eligible for entry into this study

          -  Pregnant or nursing female subjects

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements

          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the subject an unsuitable
             candidate to undergo observational study (may also include preoperative testing
             results including electrocardiogram [EKG], chest x-ray, or pulmonary function tests
             that preclude a wide excision in the operating room)
