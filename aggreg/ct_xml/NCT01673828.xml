  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide initial data on the safety and effectiveness of allopregnanolone in
      improving neurobehavioral outcome and reducing mortality in adults with moderate and severe
      traumatic brain injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-finding, two-stage adaptive,
      clinical trial study comparing allopregnanolone to placebo when administered intravenously
      for 5 days beginning within 8 hours after injury. Test products to be administered are low
      and high dose allopregnanolone (Products L and H, respectively) and placebo (Product P)
      intravenous solutions. The products are administered during a 4-day treatment period
      followed by a 1-day dose de-escalation period. Stage 1 of the study will assess safety and
      confirm that dosing with Products L and H achieve the target steady-state plasma
      concentrations set for each of these products. Dosing will be adjusted in Stage 1, if
      necessary. Stage 2 will initially allocate subjects equally to Products L, H and P but will
      then use adaptive randomization to allocate subjects between Products L and H to optimized
      the probability of yielding a better 3-month Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOS-E) score.
