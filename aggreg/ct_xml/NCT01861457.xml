    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which bacterial growth in the
      nostrils by S. aureus, a common bacteria that is found in hospital environment, can be
      reduced by NOZIN速 Nasal Sanitizer速 antiseptic nasal swabs during the course of a typical
      10-hour work period in participants known to have S. aureus in their nose passages.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All healthy health care professionals between the ages of 18 and 60 years of age who
             are regular full-time employees of the MUSC Hospital, work a 10 or 12 hour work
             shift, and test positive for nasal vestibular S. aureus carriage within 10 days prior
             to their scheduled study day will be eligible to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excluded from the study will be individuals exhibiting symptoms of upper respiratory
             disease, including chronic rhinitis/sinusitis, seasonal allergies, upper respiratory
             infection during the previous four weeks, have known allergy to citrus or soy oil, or

             from smoking for at least one year prior to the study.  Subjects must be able and
             agree to refrain from using prescription and non-prescription nasal spray or other
             nasal preparations or washes from the time of their screening up to and during their
             scheduled study day.
