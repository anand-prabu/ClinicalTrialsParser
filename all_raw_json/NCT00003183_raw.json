Combining chemotherapy with G-CSF may make tumor cells more\n      sensitive to the chemotherapy drug and may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of mitoxantrone plus G-CSF in treating\n      patients with metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Study the effectiveness of mitoxantrone in patients with metastatic, hormone\n      refractory prostate cancer. II. Assess the side effects of mitoxantrone in this patient\n      population. III. Determine whether filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF)\n      treatment can overcome chronic bone marrow suppression and facilitate a dose intensive\n      mitoxantrone chemotherapy regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive a 30 minute intravenous infusion\n      of mitoxantrone once a week on day 1. On days 2-6 of each week, patients receive\n      subcutaneous filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF). Treatment continues\n      for patients who respond to therapy and exhibit no disease progression. Dose escalation\n      proceeds until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mitoxantrone with G-CSF support is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity. After the MTD is determined, an additional 20-40 patients\n      are enrolled at this dose level to examine their response to this therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-24 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of\n      this protocol. An additional 20-40 patients may be accrued for the phase II portion of this\n      study."
