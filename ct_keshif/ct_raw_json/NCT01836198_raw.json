The study is split into two parts, Part A and Part B. Participants in Part\n      A are divided into two cohorts (groups).  Each cohort will participate in two study periods.\n      Period one involves a single dose of LY2409021. Period two involves either gemfibrozil or\n      ketoconazole for 21 days with LY2409021 given once on Day 4. Part A will last for 51 days\n      and will also involve screening within 27 days of the start of the study. Part B is only\n      open to participants who successfully completed Part A of the study. Participants in Part B\n      will receive one single dose of LY2409021 on Day 4 and clarithromycin for 21 days. Part B\n      will last for 29 days and will also involve screening within 27 days of the start of the\n      study."
