  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of a computer-facilitated alcohol
      screening and brief intervention (c-ASBI) system for 12- to 18-year-old primary care
      patients in a multi-site, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. The investigators
      hypothesize that, among 12- to 18-year olds patients coming for annual well-care, those
      receiving c-ASBI will have lower rates of any alcohol use at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups
      compared to Treatment As Usual (TAU).

    <description>Participants in the c-ASBI group will complete a computerized screen for alcohol, cannabis, tobacco and other drugs, then view their screen score and 10 pages of information about the health effects of substance use and true-life stories on the computer. Their provider will see a report of their screen results and provide advice to stop or decrease their use, or, for those at high risk, referral to complete a computerized motivational enhancement therapy intervention.</description>
