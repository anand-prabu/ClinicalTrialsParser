Many\n      researches on Gemcitabine combined with Oxaliplatin for treatments of recurrent and\n      refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed patients could benefit  from the combination\n      treatment . Pegaspargase plays an  important role for treatment of NK/T cell lymphoma.\n      Dexamethasone is used in combination with other agents for the treatment of  lymphomas which\n       may be implicated in the development or growth of some cancers.So we explored to evaluate\n      the efficacy and safety of Avastin combined with gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, pegaspargase and\n      dexamethasone(Avastin+ GemAOD) as first-line treatment in patients with untreated NK/T cell\n      lymphoma"
