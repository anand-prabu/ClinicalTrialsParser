            "textblock": "India accounts for over half the global burden of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in the\n      world. While it is important to accelerate efforts to prevent SAM, effective management of\n      children suffering from it is critical for reducing child mortality and achieving MDG1 and\n      MDG4.\n\n      Available evidence mostly from studies in Africa suggest that home based management of\n      uncomplicated SAM with Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF) is at least as efficacious as\n      facility-based management and that locally produced RUTF is as efficacious as centrally\n      produced RUTF. More evidence on efficacy and effectiveness of home based management using\n      RUTF is needed to decide if this intervention offers substantial advantages over\n      home-prepared foods in the Indian settings. Additionally, there is a demand to generate\n      evidence of efficacy of locally produced RUTF as compared to that of centrally produced\n      RUTF. These issues can only be resolved through a well designed randomized controlled trial.\n\n      This project therefore aims to assess the efficacy of three options under consideration in\n      India for home management of SAM. The investigators propose to conduct a multi-center\n      randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of two community-supported home-based\n      regimes using centrally or locally produced Ready to Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF) for\n      recovery from uncomplicated SAM after 16 weeks of management, compared with an augmented\n      home-prepared foods regimen. The trial will enroll 765 children with uncomplicated SAM and\n      will have enough statistical power to detect a 15% or greater difference in recovery rates\n      between either one of the intervention groups compared with the comparison group.\n\n      Participants: The study will be conducted in three sites - urban slums and resettlement\n      colonies in the national capital region, rural (predominantly tribal) Rajasthan, rural and\n      urban Tamil Nadu. Field workers will survey the study area to measure mid-upper arm\n      circumference (MUAC) in children 6 to 59 months of age and refer children with MUAC less\n      than 13 cm to a study clinic. At the study clinic, anthropometric measurements will be taken\n      and children with weight for height less than -3 SD of the WHO standards or oedema of both\n      feet will be offered participation in the study.\n\n      Intervention and Comparison Regimes for Home Management of SAM\n\n        -  Children randomized to the first intervention arm (Arm 1) will receive a centrally\n           produced RUTF.\n\n        -  Children randomized to the second intervention arm (Arm 2) will receive a locally\n           produced RUTF.\n\n        -  Children randomized to the comparison group (Arm 3) will receive augmented\n           Home-Prepared Foods.\n\n      The amount of food advised for each child in all the 3 study arms are calculated to provide\n      175cal/kg body weight per day. These foods will be given to children from the time of\n      enrollment until recovery (but not beyond 16 weeks). Caregivers of all enrolled children\n      will receive counseling on frequency of feeding, amounts to be fed, encouraging children to\n      continue breastfeeding and good hygiene practices.\n\n      Management Phases: The management will be in two phases:\n\n      Treatment Phase: From enrollment until recovery or 16 weeks (whichever is earlier), enrolled\n      children will be provided the foods according to the study group they are randomized to, and\n      counseled on their use.\n\n      Sustenance Phase: After completion of the treatment phase, children in all arms will be\n      referred to the closest Anganwadi centre from where he/she will access supplementary foods\n      given to children as a part of the ICDS strategy. The sustenance phase will last for 16\n      weeks after end of treatment phase.\n\n      Outcomes: A trained and standardized team of field workers will conduct weekly\n      anthropometric measurements and also record morbidity, hospitalizations and deaths from\n      enrolment, weekly till recovery or 16 weeks whichever is earlier. In addition, mortality and\n      hospitalization data will be collected at 16 weeks post treatment phase.\n\n      The primary outcome will be recovery by 16 weeks after enrollment (defined as achieving\n      weight for height greater than or equal to -2 SD and absence of oedema).\n\n      Secondary outcomes will include:\n\n        -  To compare the weight gain (in grams/kg body weight/day) from enrolment till recovery,\n           or till 16 weeks in those who do not attain recovery, at 16 weeks after recovery.\n\n        -  To compare the time required to reach recovery (in weeks).\n\n        -  To determine the incidence and prevalence of diarrhea, ARI and fever during the\n           treatment phase\n\n        -  To compare the mortality and hospitalizations during the treatment phase, 16 weeks\n           after recovery\n\n        -  To compare the perceptions of families, health care providers and ICDS functionaries\n           regarding feasibility of use of the feeding regimens in a sub sample from enrolment tom\n           completion of treatment phase\n\n        -  To ascertain factors which affect recovery, at 16 weeks post enrolment in those who do\n           not recover.\n\n        -  To compare the perceptions of families regarding Anganwadi centre experience at the end\n           of sustenance phase.\n\n        -  To document the costs of implementing the feeding regimens till end of treatment phase.\n\n      The project has been approved by the National Research Alliance for SAM constituted by the\n      Department of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health Research and Department of\n      Biotechnology. It will be coordinated by Centre for Health Research and Development-Society\n      for Applied Studies.  WHO will provide technical support and monitoring for the study\n      implementation as a response to a request from the Alliance. Oversight to the study will be\n      provided by a Technical Advisory group constituted by the Alliance and a Data Safety\n      Monitoring Board. Clearances have been sought from the state governments of Delhi, Rajasthan\n      and Tamil Nadu."
