  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to study the effect of adjunctive chronotherapy (wake therapy, sleep
      phase advance, and bright light therapy) on acutely depressed inpatients. The investigators
      will attempt to recruit individuals admitted to the acute inpatient unit and study the
      results of the treatment on depressive symptoms, and suicidality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute depression, and suicidality continue to be significant causes of morbidity and
      mortality, and frequently result in acute inpatient hospitalization. Currently available
      treatments for depression have limitations for acute care including, either a slow onset of
      action such as is the case of pharmacotherapy, or high cost and limited availability such as
      is the case for ECT. This is exacerbated by ever shortening hospitalization times.
      Subsequently many of the individuals who are admitted for depression are discharged weeks
      before it can be expected for them to have symptomatic relief. Further more, in many cases
      treatment results in the trial of multiple medications before an effective treatment regimen
      is found (if such a treatment is found at all) (Rush, Trivedi et al. 2006). There is
      subsequently a great need for effective anti-depressant therapies with rapid onset of
      action, widespread availability, and cost effectiveness.

      There is a consistent and expanding body of literature showing that chronotherapy is an
      effective, and rapid treatment of acute depression(Wu, Kelsoe et al. 2009, Martiny,
      Refsgaard et al. 2012, Echizenya, Suda et al. 2013). Published studies report response and
      remission rates in the range of 41-61%, 24-59% respectively acutely. Chronotherapy is a
      brief protocol that involves the combination of wake therapy (total sleep deprivation),
      sleep phase advance (a shift to an earlier sleep schedule with gradual normalization), and
      bright light therapy. The currently published reports have demonstrated efficacy in both
      unipolar and bipolar depression, and there has been reported stability of results for as
      long as 9 weeks (which was the longest designed study). Studies have been completed in real
      world clinical populations, which have included co-morbid populations, with the only groups
      showing a worsening of effect being those with psychotic depression (Benedetti, Zanardi et
      al. 1999), and those with panic disorder(Roy-Byrne, Uhde et al. 1986). The treatment itself
      has been well tolerated with a high percentage of individuals completing the procedure.

      The current body of literature is encouraging, and the technique is being utilized
      clinically in some facilities (including our own institution), however there are still
      relatively few clinical trials published, and still unanswered questions that limit
      widespread clinical utility. One such issue is related to the high percentage of published
      trials performed outside of the US (although some have been done in the US). Because a high
      percentage of the studies have been done in other countries it is not clear if this
      procedure will translate well into the treatment paradigm in the US. Currently in the US,
      inpatient admission is restricted to individuals with severe, often highly treatment
      resistant disease that includes acute suicidality. To this writers knowledge there have not
      been any studies that specifically address suicidality. It is also not clear if patients in
      the US will tolerate the procedure. Tolerability has been addressed in many of the published
      papers, and in general the procedure is tolerated well with few if any side effects,
      however, again it is unclear how the procedure would be tolerated in clinical patients in
      the US.
