      This project will involve the development and initial evaluation of a promising
      computer-based intervention to improve the primary care management of risky alcohol use
      among Veterans. The intervention uses a Relational Agent, an on-screen &quot;person&quot; that
      establishes a relationship with the Veteran to promote positive health behaviors. This study
      will determine how Veterans interact with this system, how it can be tailored to Veterans'
      preferences, and its potential effect on risky drinking. If ultimately proven effective, the
      Relational Agent will have several impacts on Veterans and their health care, including (1)
      lower rates of risky drinking in Veterans; (2) improved rates of brief counseling for
      Veterans with excessive alcohol use; (3) increased proportion of Veterans referred to Mental
      Health for alcohol disorders; and (4) improved care for Veterans with low levels of health
      literacy. This study directly supports Secretary Shinseki's Transformational Initiative to
      employ state-of-the-art information technology to improve quality and access of Veterans'
      health care.

      Background: VA has demonstrated national leadership by implementing electronic clinical
      reminders and establishing performance measures for both screening and brief intervention
      for unhealthy alcohol use. Nationally, about 93% of Veterans are screened annually. However,
      the percentage of brief interventions delivered when needed, and the quality and
      effectiveness of those interventions, are uncertain. A patient centered computer-based
      intervention can help to close the performance gap by delivering a tailored intervention
      with excellent quality and fidelity. Relational Agents are on-screen characters that speak
      to the patient and establish a &quot;relationship&quot; with them. They have been used to improve
      several health behaviors including diet and exercise, and can overcome communication
      barriers related to low levels of computer literacy. The Relational Agent can be placed on a
      desktop or tablet computer with a touch screen, on which patients indicate their responses.
      Using Motivational Interviewing and behavior change principles, the Relational Agent guides
      patients to consider change. Use of such an &quot;eHealth&quot; tool offloads a time-intensive task
      from the clinician while providing the patient, who may have limited computer skills, a
      non-threatening vehicle for &quot;discussing&quot; a stigmatized topic such as risky alcohol use.
      Relational Agents have proven more effective than web-based interventions in promoting
      health-related behavior changes in some studies. Pilot studies at VA Boston demonstrate that
      Veterans will engage with Relational Agents and view them favorably. To date, there have
      been no VA trials of Relational Agents. Aims: The study aims are to 1) Tailor the Relational
      Agent Intervention to the Veteran population; 2) Conduct a randomized controlled trial of
      Treatment as Usual plus the Relational Agent versus Treatment as Usual for unhealthy alcohol
      use; and 3) Examine in-depth Veterans' experience with the Relational Agent Intervention.
      Methods: To achieve Aim 1, we will use standard software development techniques, including
      cognitive interviewing and usability testing, to tailor the Relational Agent Intervention to
      the Veteran population. Once the Relational Agent is refined, we will conduct a two-arm RCT
      (Aim 2) in the VA Boston Healthcare System. We will randomize Veterans in primary care to
      Treatment as Usual plus the Relational Agent versus Treatment as Usual, using a stratified
      randomization scheme to ensure equal numbers of Veterans with unhealthy alcohol use (risky
      and hazardous drinking) and Veterans with alcohol use disorders (a more severe
      classification) in each group. Working closely with primary care staff, who routinely screen
      Veterans for risky alcohol use, we will identify Veterans who screen positive and ask them
      to participate in the study. We will recruit 180 Veterans over 15 months, with a goal of
      completing the study with 126 to 144 participants. Veterans allocated to the Relational
      Agent Intervention arm will interact with the Relational Agent at the time of the primary
      care visit and will be scheduled for a one-month follow-up visit for a second interaction
      with the Relational Agent. The Relational Agent will provide personal feedback for the
      Veteran and the clinician, and will flag Veterans who meet criteria for referral to
      treatment. Alcohol use and related behaviors will be assessed by in-person survey at
      baseline and by telephone survey at a 3-month follow-up. Primary outcome measures will be
      quantity and frequency of alcohol use at the 3-month follow-up, with rates of brief
      intervention, referral to treatment, and satisfaction as secondary outcomes. Subgroup
      analyses will allow for examining separately the effects of the Relational Agent on
      unhealthy alcohol use and on Veterans with alcohol abuse or dependence. Following the RCT,
      we will conduct a formative evaluation (Aim 3), with in-depth interviews, to characterize
      the elements of the Intervention that emerge as most effective and those that seem
      extraneous or even counter-productive.
