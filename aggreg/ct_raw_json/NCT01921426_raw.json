This study will also evaluate GC4419\n      for the following:\n\n        -  Effect on the incidence and severity of radiation induced oral mucositis;\n\n        -  Effect on the response rate of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck who are\n           receiving radiation therapy and chemotherapy;\n\n        -  Total concentrations of GC4419 that can be achieved in the blood;\n\n        -  Changes in proteins and genetics associated with oral mucositis;\n\n        -  Impact on delayed toxicities of radiation (dry mouth and reduced ability to fully open\n           the mouth);\n\n        -  Observe changes in genetic and molecular markers of oral mucositis;\n\n        -  Observe the usage of extra health resources (e.g., unplanned ER visits, feeding tube\n           use, etc.) of study patients;\n\n        -  Assess the overall quality of life in study patients with oral mucositis."
