      This is a national, non interventional, prospective study performed in the general practice
      setting.

      The study has been designed :

        -  to assess the level of concordance between patients' cardiovascular risk perception and
           the cardiovascular risk evaluated by the physicians,

        -  and to evaluate the impact of patients' exposure to a medical information leaflet on
           patients' cardiovascular risk perception.
