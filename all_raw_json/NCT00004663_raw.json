Intensive data collection begins when a\n      patient becomes pregnant.\n\n      Pregnant women are evaluated with interval pregnancy/exposure history and a clinical exam,\n      including the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM). Assessments are scheduled every 3\n      months as follows:  visit 1 when the pregnancy is confirmed, visit 2 during the second\n      trimester, visit 3 during the third trimester, visit 4 at 3 months postpartum, and visit 5\n      at 6 months postpartum.  Visits 4 and 5 include an infant exam for growth and morphologic\n      parameters; these visits occur on the same schedule if there is a miscarriage or stillbirth.\n\n      Patients not currently pregnant are randomly chosen to be followed as controls.  These\n      patients undergo a review of current pregnancy status and measures of disease activity,\n      including SLAM, every 3 months for 5 visits."
