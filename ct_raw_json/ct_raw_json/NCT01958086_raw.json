Both Neuroport Arrays are inserted into Brodmann's Area 5 in the posterior parietal cortex, an area of the brain used in reach planning.  The arrays are inserted and the percutaneous pedestal is attached to the skull during a surgical procedure.  Following surgical recovery the subject will participate in study sessions 3-5 times per week in which they will learn to use thought to control a simple computer environment or a tablet computer."

            "textblock": "The investigators objective is to run human clinical trials in which brain activity recorded\n      through a \"brain-chip\" implanted in the human brain can be used to provide novel\n      communication capabilities to severely paralyzed individuals by allowing direct\n      brain-control of a computer interface. A prospective, longitudinal, single-arm early\n      feasibility study will be used to examine the safety and effectiveness of using a neural\n      communication system to control a simple computer interface and a tablet computer. Initial\n      brain control training will occur in simplified computer environments, however, the ultimate\n      objective of the clinical trial is to allow the human patient autonomous control over the\n      Google Android tablet operating system. Tablet computers offer a balance of ease of use and\n      functionality that should facilitate fusion with the BMI. The tablet interface could\n      potentially allow the patient population to make a phone call, manage personal finances,\n      watch movies, paint pictures, play videogames, program applications, and interact with a\n      variety of \"smart\" devices such as televisions, kitchen appliances, and perhaps in time,\n      devices such as robotic limbs and smart cars. Brain control of tablet computers has the\n      potential to greatly improve the quality of life of severely paralyzed individuals.  Two\n      subjects will be enrolled, each implanted with the NCS for a period of 53 weeks. The study\n      is expected to take two years in total."
