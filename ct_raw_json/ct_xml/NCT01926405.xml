  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypersomnia is defined as a reduced ability to remain awake during the day. There are
      basically two types of central hypersomnia: narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.
      Currently, the diagnosis of these sleep disorders is based on polysomnographic recordings
      which is difficult to access. Tests of sleepiness (Epworth, Karolinska) are subjective.

      A biological marker of sleepiness, easily accessible and measurable, would be very useful
      for the diagnosis and therapeutic follow up of excessive diurnal sleepiness. Salivary
      secretions appear as good physiological markers. Studies have shown for healthy subjects,
      that the expression and activity of salivary amylase are increased when subjects are
      deprived of sleep.

      The investigators propose to explore the usefulness of salivary biomarkers (including
      amylase) as a new non-invasive and simple technique for the assessment of excessive daytime
      sleepiness.
