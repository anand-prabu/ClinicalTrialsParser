The purpose of this study is to compare the\n      effects, good and/or bad, of two types of prosthetic meshes: one that is made from pig skin\n      (called a \"biologic prosthetic\"), and one that is made in a laboratory (called a \"synthetic\n      prosthetic\").  This study will include some patients who have an infection in/near the\n      hernia, and other patients who do not have an infection. We expect the synthetic mesh to be\n      associated with a higher rate of early post-operative surgical site infection and fluid\n      collections (seromas), while we expect the biologic mesh to be associated with a higher rate\n      of recurrence."

The two\n      prosthetic meshes to be studied are Ventralight (Bard, Murray Hill, NJ), a synthetic mesh\n      chiefly made of polypropylene and Strattice (LifeCell, Branchburg, NJ), a biologic mesh\n      derived from porcine dermis. The study population will consist of patients who are in need\n      of a repair of a complex ventral hernia. Patients will be enrolled in the study for 24\n      months following their operation or until they experience a recurrence of their hernia,\n      whichever occurs first. The primary outcome variable is recurrence and the secondary outcome\n      variables are post-operative surgical site infections and overall costs.\n\n      There is no universally agreed upon definition of what constitutes a \"complex\" ventral\n      hernia. For our purposes, a \"complex\" ventral hernia is one that involves a compromised\n      surgical field, in which gastrointestinal, biliary, or genitourinary procedures are\n      performed, one in which the wound class is considered clean-contaminated, contaminated, or\n      dirty due to other causes, such as infected meshes and enterocutaneous fistulas, or surgical\n      procedures conducted in patients with large ventral hernia defects (>10 cm in any single\n      dimension)."
