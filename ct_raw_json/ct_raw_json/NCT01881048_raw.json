This unique window in breast cancer management serves as a valuable\n      opportunity to obtain preliminary data on biomarkers and the alterations that occur when the\n      system is troubled by a drug or other intervention which will be instrumental in designing\n      future therapeutic or preventative strategies for larger clinical study."
