The hypothesis is that both individual and group based\n      neuropsychological rehabilitation show positive effects on the psychosocial wellbeing and\n      perceived cognitive deficits. Another purpose of this study is to evaluate weather\n      individual and group based neuropsychological rehabilitation have different kind of effects\n      on the wellbeing of the participants and weather either one of the rehabilitation formats is\n      more effective than the other."

High quality research on the best and most cost-effective rehabilitation methods\n      is needed.\n\n      Objective: To study whether neuropsychological rehabilitation improves the psychosocial\n      wellbeing and perceived cognitive deficits in dyslexic young adults and to evaluate\n      potential differences between individual and group based neuropsychological rehabilitation.\n\n      Methods: Altogether 120 young adults diagnosed with dyslexia are randomized either to one of\n      the intervention groups (individual neuropsychological rehabilitation / group\n      neuropsychological rehabilitation) or to a control group which will receive either one of\n      the interventions after a 5 month waiting period. All the study subjects are assessed with a\n      short neuropsychological test battery as well as self-rating questionnaires evaluating mood,\n      QoL, perceived cognitive deficits, and the impact of the learning disability at baseline,\n      after five months (immediately after interventions or control period) and after 10 months.\n      After 20 months a shorter follow-up using only self-ratings will be done via mail. Subjects\n      in the intervention groups are offered neuropsychological rehabilitation in 12 sessions\n      conducted once a week or once in two weeks during five months. Subjects in the control group\n      do not receive any intervention for the first five months.\n\n      Results: The effects of interventions on psychosocial wellbeing and perceived cognitive\n      deficits are evaluated using appropriate statistical procedures and comparing the\n      differences between the interventions groups and the control group.\n\n      The present status: The baseline assessments and the first interventions will start in\n      August 2013."
