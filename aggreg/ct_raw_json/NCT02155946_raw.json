            "textblock": "The aging US population threatens to overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, especially\n      since the rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone is expected to triple in the coming\n      decades. Memory cause functional impairment, reduced quality of life, increased caregiver\n      burnout, and eventual institutionalization. The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\n      identifies those with memory deficits but who remain relatively independent in everyday\n      life. MCI provides a window for interventions that target memory functioning. The proposed\n      study focuses specifically on a groundbreaking combination of mnemonic rehabilitation and\n      non-invasive brain stimulation. The main idea is that brain stimulation can enhance\n      functioning in the specific brain regions/networks, thereby increasing the patients' ability\n      to benefit from memory rehabilitation. This will be a randomized, double-blind study (active\n      vs. fake brain stimulation), that provides multiple treatment session. Outcome will be\n      examined using both laboratory-based and real-world memory testing as well as brain imaging.\n      This first-of-its-kind study has the potential to meaningfully translate more \"basic\"\n      science findings into neuroanatomically targeted and functionally meaningful treatments for\n      our aging population."
