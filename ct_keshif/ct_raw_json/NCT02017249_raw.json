            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to learn more about the ability of a substance called arginine\n      to improve the functioning of the immune system in people with a certain type of brain\n      tumor. This could lead to improvements in a type of treatment for brain tumors called\n      immunotherapy. The immune system includes organs, cells, and substances in the body that\n      fight infection and disease. Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that uses the immune\n      system as a tool to seek out and destroy abnormal cells. Immunotherapy requires that the\n      immune system be working properly. Arginine is a normal component of protein (an amino acid)\n      that we all consume in foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products and that\n      our bodies can make. Arginine helps the immune system function normally. Recent research has\n      shown that certain types of brain tumors decrease the amount of arginine in the body leading\n      to impaired immune system function. This may interfere with the ability of immunotherapy to\n      fight abnormal cells.  We would like to see if giving people with brain tumors arginine in\n      powder form will make their immune systems work better."

Patient must have laboratory values, as determined by institutional controls, within\n             the following parameters:\n\n               -  White blood cell count above lowest level for normal range\n\n               -  Renal function within normal limits (creatinine, BUN)\n\n               -  Liver function within normal limits (AST/ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline\n                  phosphatase)\n\n          8. Written informed consent is obtained prior to initiation of study procedures.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Known autoimmune condition, underlying immune disease, or use of immunomodulatory\n             prescription drugs (aside from steroids) for any medical condition.\n\n          2. Prescribed vasodilator medications: Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Sildenafil\n             (Viagra), Nitrates, Alpha blockers: Terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura),\n             alfuzosin (Uroxatral), tamsulosin (Flomax), and prazosin (Minipress).\n\n          3. Glaucoma\n\n          4. Known Herpes simplex virus (i.e. cold sores)\n\n          5. History of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease.\n\n          6. Known allergy or intolerance to arginine.\n\n          7. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled seizures.\n\n          8. KPS less than 80.\n\n          9.
