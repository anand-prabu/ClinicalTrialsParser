Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the study doctor prior to\n                  starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the\n                  course of the study, and after end of study therapy. This applies even if the\n                  subject practices true abstinence  from heterosexual contact.\n\n               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be\n                  reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use, and be able to comply with,\n                  effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting study\n                  drug, during the study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 28 days\n                  after discontinuation of study therapy.\n\n          -  All other females must had either a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy at least 6\n             months before screening (proper documentation required) OR been naturally\n             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. who has not had menses at any\n             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). For this study,  in subjects who are\n             postmenopausal, estradiol level must be <30 pg/mL and plasma FSH must be >40 IU/L at\n             screening.\n\n          -  Males (including those who have had a vasectomy):\n\n               1.

(Cholecystecomy and appendectomy are permissible.)\n\n          -  Use of antimyeloma agents (other than thalidomide) or investigational agents within 7\n             days before the start of the PK phase.\n\n          -  Prior history of allergic reactions to thalidomide, thalidomide excipients (as\n             referenced in the IB), or to related drugs (ie, lenalidomide).\n\n          -  Prior history of malignancies, other than multiple myeloma, unless the subject has\n             been free of the disease for >= 3 years (from the time of signing the ICD).\n             Exceptions include the following:\n\n               1. Basal cell carcinoma of the skin\n\n               2. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n\n               3. Carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n\n               4.
