    <textblock>
      This evaluation will evaluate a new system from YOFiMeter, known as YOFiLife Blood Glucose
      Monitoring System with YOFiMeter glucometer.  YOFiLife includes a web- based data system
      known as the Web Portal and smart phone apps for the iPhone and Android. The new YOFiMeter
      is similar to other glucometers with the exception of built in test cassettes, lancet
      cassettes with enhanced communications and data reviewing options.

      This evaluation will also collect data from a YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer reference
      glucometer.  The YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer will be used as the &quot;gold&quot; standard
      with all results compared to the YSI results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single evaluation to assess both the Yofimeter system accuracy in the hands of the
      intended users, as well as other aspects to support lay use, such as labeling assessment and
      usability.  The company is presenting diabetics who monitor their blood glucose with new
      technological innovations aimed at improving their daily lives (e.g., a unique blood glucose
      monitor, Web Portal applications and &quot;smart phone&quot; applications).

      Each subject selected for the comparison evaluation will perform their own fingerstick and
      test on their subject device following device instructions. A trained technician will
      perform a fingerstick on the subject immediately after and perform the test on the same
      device. Separate results will be recorded by subject and technician. A trained technician
      will take another blood sample, within as short of a time as practicable, for a glucose
      assay on the YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer.

          2. Is the subject able to provide legal, written informed consent?

          3. Is the subject willing to have fingersticks for blood glucose determination?

          4. Does the subject show an ability and willingness to follow directions of the
             Investigator and staff?

          5. Is the subject 18 years of age or older?

          3. Is the subject unwilling or unable to provide concurrent blood glucose level
             determinations with the YOFiMeter whenever blood glucose levels are determined at the
             Investigator's site?

          4. Is the subject, or a family member, employed by a company that develops or markets
             blood glucose level determining devices?
