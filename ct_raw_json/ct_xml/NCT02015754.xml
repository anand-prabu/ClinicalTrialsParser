      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of using small beads
      (70-150 micron in place of 100-300 micron) to deliver chemotherapy into the liver to treat
      patients with liver lesions from colorectal cancer. The beads (LC-Bead M1) will be loaded
      with irinotecan (DEBIRI-M1), and used to administer transarterichemoembolization (TACE).

      Eligibility:

      Patients with liver cancer from colorectal cancer.

      Study Overview/ Treatment:

      DEBIRI, loaded with irinotecan, is a device that utilizes tiny beads (70-150 microns) to
      deliver chemotherapy agents into liver tumor(s) via the hepatic artery. This device allows
      for continuous release of irinotecan into the liver tumor tissue(s) causing necrosis of the
      targeted tumor(s). The potential advantages of the smaller beads are deeper penetration into
      the tumor bed, while avoiding premature proximal occlusion of vessels feeding the tumor, and
      more consistent dosing.  Response to therapy will be evaluated monthly by clinic visits and
      blood tests (to include assessment of liver function and tumor markers) and by imaging
      (usually MRIs) every 1-2 months. Patients will be on study for 6 months after which they
      will be exited from the study and followed for survival. Once exited from the study they
      will continue to be eligible to receive DEBIRI, should it be recommended.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer with hepatic metastases who have failed or
        are intolerant to at least one systemic chemotherapy or liver directed therapy.

          1. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) performance status of
             0-2 at study entry.

          2. The patient is age 18 years or older.

          3. The patient has a life expectancy of &gt;12 weeks.

          4. Patients with liver dominant disease defined as &gt;/=75% tumor body burden confined to
             the liver

          5. Less than 60% liver tumor replacement

          6. At least one month has elapsed since most recent prior cancer therapy with the
             following exception:

             -Chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan based regimens) may continue if there is evidence
             of hepatic progression on treatment providing there is no change in the therapy in
             the 1 month prior to DEBIRI-TACE treatment and any immediate chemotherapeutic
             toxicity that will complicate DEBIRI-TACE is resolved. In this case, the chemotherapy
             may continue because it is continuing to control the extrahepatic disease.

          7. The patient has measurable disease that will be directly treated with intrahepatic
             therapy (as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1).

         14. The patient, if a woman of childbearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test.

         15. The patient is able to give written informed consent.

         16. The patient is willing and able to comply with study procedures, scheduled visits,
             and treatment plans.
