  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

        Adult patients with previously untreated, intermediate-2 or high- risk MDS or  CMML not
        eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) based on documented patients
        characteristics like age, performance status, concomitant diagnoses, and organ
        dysfunctions

        Exclusion criteria:

        Prior or concomitant therapy for higher risk MDS (for example, but not limited to,
        hypomethylating agents like azacitidine).  Note: Prior treatment with Erythropoietin (EPO)
        and iron- chelation is allowed up to &gt;3 months before treatment with study medication.
        Patients must have not received MDS therapy since diagnosis of higher-risk MDS. However,
        previous lenalidomide treatment could have been administered for lower-risk MDS treatment
        as long as this therapy was discontinued at least 12 months before initation of the
        current study treatment.

        Treatment with any investigational drug within 2 weeks before first administration of
        present trial drug or within less than 5 half lives of the investigational drug before
        treatment with the present trial drug, whichever is longer.

        Second malignancy currently requiring active therapy (except for hormonal/anti-hormonal
        treatment, e.g. in prostate or breast cancer).

        Corrected QT interval according to Friederica (QTcF) prolongation &gt; 470 ms or QT
        prolongation deemed clinically relevant by the investigator (e.g., congenital long QT
        syndrome).The QTcF will be calculated as the mean of the 3 Electrocardiograms (ECGs) taken
        at screening.

        Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal not related to Gilberts disease, hemolysis,
        or secondary to MDS.

        Aspartate amino transferase (AST) or alanine amino transferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 x the upper
        limit of normal (ULN) Creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or
        laboratory evidence for a chronic infection (hepatitis test results done in routine
        diagnostics are acceptable if done within 14 days before first study treatment dose).

        HIV infection (HIV test results in routine diagnostics are acceptable if done within 14
        days before first study treatment dose).

        Severe illness or organ dysfunction involving the kidney, liver or other organ system
        (e.g. active uncontrolled infection , unstable angina pectoris or history of severe
        congestive heart failure, clinically unstable cardiac disease or pulmonary disease),
        which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the evaluation of the safety
        of the study treatment
