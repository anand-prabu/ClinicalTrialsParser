  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Severe Asthma Research Program III is an NIH cooperative agreement involving 7 clinical
      centers that encompass a multidisciplinary partnerships between asthma clinician-scientists
      and scientists with expertise in immunology, pulmonary physiology, molecular genetics,
      molecular phenotyping, imaging, and bioinformatics. These clinical centers will jointly
      recruit volunteers with asthma for an observational longitudinal follow-up study. However,
      centers will also conduct specific mechanistic research projects at each participating
      institution. The University of Pittsburgh's SARP III study will determine the molecular and
      clinical stability of asthma phenotypes over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The longitudinal follow-up study is divided into a characterization and longitudinal phase.
      During the characterization subjects will undergo a baseline evaluation that will include
      will include answering questionnaires, lung function testing, and chest tomography.
      Subsequently, to determine steroid responsiveness, all subjects will receive one
      intramuscular dose of 40 mg in 1ml (1 mg/kg for children &lt;18 years old, up to 40 mg maximum.
      Participants at the University of Pittsburgh will undergo a bronchoscopy to provide airway
      samples. The longitudinal phase will include a 36 month follow-up time with annual visits
      and phone calls every 6 months. During it, participants will answer questionnaires and
      provide sputum samples on two occasions, and will perform lung function testing.

      The SARP III longitudinal follow up study (all centers) will determine the long term
      stability and implications of clinical and molecular asthma phenotypes and identify
      potential systemic biomarkers for these phenotypes

      The University of Pittsburgh center will test the hypothesis that a) a mast cell signature
      is present and longitudinally maintained in severe asthma; and b)  That the  persistent
      signature determines short and long term outcomes  through interactions with lung and
      inflammatory cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous asthma diagnosis

          -  FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility ≥12% or airway hyperresponsiveness reflected by a
             methacholine PC20 ≤16 mg/mL (Historical methacholine data from previous NIH trial
             [SARP I or II, AsthmaNet, ALA-ACRC, ACRN or CARE] will be allowed).

        Exclusion Criteria:
