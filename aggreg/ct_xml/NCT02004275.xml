      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide and
      ixazomib when given together with dexamethasone and to see how well pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone with or without ixazomib works in treating patients with refractory multiple
      myeloma. Biological therapies, such as pomalidomide and dexamethasone, may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Ixazomib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet
      known whether pomalidomide and dexamethasone are more effective with or without ixazomib in
      treating multiple myeloma.

      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pomalidomide, dexamethasone and ixazomib
      followed by a phase II study. The primary purpose of the Phase I portion of the study is to
      establish the maximum tolerated dose for combination therapy
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib. Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) on days 1-21, dexamethasone PO QD on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and ixazomib PO QD on days
      1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. About 24 patients will take part in this
      portion of the study.

      The primary purpose of the Phase II portion of the study is to assess whether the
      combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves progression free survival
      relative to pomalidomide/dexamethasone. Please see the &quot;Arms&quot; section below for a detailed
      description of the treatment arms for Phase II of the study. The dose for pomalidomide and
      ixazomib will be determined in phase I of the study. About 108 patients will take part in
      this portion of the study. The secondary objectives are listed below.

      Secondary Phase I Objectives:

        1. To determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)

        2. To analyze type and grade of all serious adverse events (SAEs)

        3. To analyze type and grade of all adverse events (AEs)

        4. To analyze the reason for and incidence of dose modifications/omissions/delays

        5. To assess preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy

      Secondary Phase II Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), partial response (PR), very good partial
           response (VGPR), complete response (CR) and stringent CR (sCR) rate for
           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone

        2. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR: minimal response (MR) + ORR) for
           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone

        3. To assess the disease control rate (DCR: stable disease (SD) + CBR) for
           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone

        4. For those patients achieving a PR or better, we will assess whether the combination of
           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib increases the duration of response (DOR) compared
           to pomalidomide/dexamethasone.

        5. To assess whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves
           overall survival (OS) compared to those taking pomalidomide/dexamethasone alone.

        6. To assess time to next treatment (TNT) for patients taking
           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to those on pomalidomide/dexamethasone.

        7. To evaluate the safety of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared with
           pomalidomide/dexamethasone.

        8. For patients on the pomalidomide/dexamethasone arm who opt to cross-over to the
           pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib arm, assessment of response rate (ORR, CBR, DCR)
           DOR, TNT, PFS, and OS will be evaluated from date of cross-over.

        9. To determine if baseline level of perceived fatigue and overall quality of life (QOL)
           is associated with OS.

      Patients are followed up every 4 weeks until disease progression, death or the withdrawal of
      informed consent.

          3. Prior Treatment:

               1. Previously treated symptomatic multiple myeloma

               2. Lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitor-refractory multiple myeloma (dual
                  refractory disease)

                    -  Lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitor-refractory disease is defined as
                       disease progression on or progression within 60 days of the last dose of a
                       lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitor-based treatment.

                    -  Patients should have received at least 2 cycles of a lenalidomide or
                       proteasome inhibitor-based regimen at standard doses to be evaluable for
                       refractoriness.

                    -  Patients can be refractory to either bortezomib or carfilzomib they do not
                       need to be refractory to both.

                    -  Patients can be refractory to lenalidomide and proteasome inhibitors given
                       sequentially as part of different lines of therapy or therapy that includes
                       a combination of lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.

               3. At least 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy for multiple myeloma

                    -  A line of therapy for myeloma is defined as 1 or more planned cycles of
                       single agent or combination therapy, as well as a planned series of
                       treatment regimens administered in a sequential manner (e.g. lenalidomide,
                       bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy for 4 cycles followed by
                       autologous stem cell transplantation and then lenalidomide maintenance
                       therapy would be considered 1 line of prior therapy).

                    -  A new line of therapy begins when a planned therapy is modified to include
                       other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of disease
                       progression, disease relapse or treatment-related toxicity (e.g. a patient
                       is progressing in the face of lenalidomide maintenance therapy and has
                       bortezomib and dexamethasone added into their regimen).

                    -  A new line of therapy also begins when a planned treatment-free interval is
                       interrupted by the need to start treatment due to disease
                       relapse/progression (e.g. a patient with relapsed myeloma achieves a
                       partial response after a planned 8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib
                       and dexamethasone, enjoys an 8-month period off therapy but then
                       experiences disease progression requiring re-initiation of therapy).

               4. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is allowed provided the patient is ≥ 1 year
                  from transplant, is not on immunosuppressive therapy to treat/prevent
                  graft-versus-host disease, has no evidence of active graft versus host disease,
                  no evidence of active infection and meets all other criteria for participation.

                  and phase II

                    -  Sensitivity to pomalidomide is defined as an MR or better to prior
                       pomalidomide-based therapy that is maintained for ≥60 days from the last
                       dose of therapy.

               8. No concurrent investigational therapy

               9. No major surgery within 28 days prior to registration

              10. Patients cannot have received G-CSF (Filgrastim) or GM-CSF (Sargramostim) within

                  eligibility criteria

          4. Non-pregnant and non-nursing:

             A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who has not undergone
             a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or has not been naturally postmenopausal for
             at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
