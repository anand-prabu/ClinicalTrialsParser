            "textblock": "The planned study is a single-center, randomized, open-label parallel group study in 16\n      healthy male subjects. Study subjects will be randomly allocated either to the metamizole\n      group (1) or to the naproxen group (2). All participants will start with a low sodium diet\n      (approximately 50 mmol Na+ per day) 7 days before the first drug intake and maintain the\n      diet until the end of the study (14 days in total). Salt-depletion is an accepted model to\n      enhance production of vasodilatory prostaglandins and to increase renal sensitivity to\n      prostaglandin inhibition. On the first day of treatment (Day 1), a single dose of metamizole\n      or naproxen will be administered to investigate the effects after a single dose and to\n      collect single dose pharmacokinetic profiles. Starting on Day 2, all participants will\n      receive therapeutic doses, i.e. 1000 mg metamizole 'ter in die' (TID, three times a day) or\n      500 mg naproxen 'bis in die' (BID, twice a day) for one week and on Day 7 pharmacokinetics\n      and pharmacodynamics effects will be assessed under near steady-state conditions.\n\n      The primary objective is the characterization of the renal effects of metamizole by\n      determination of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the inulin clearance. Secondary\n      objectives are the characterization of the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and\n      the prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) metabolite 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 (PGF1)alpha as well as the\n      urinary excretion of sodium and potassium.\n\n      Overall, clinical experience suggests better renal tolerability of metamizole possibly due\n      to less potent COX-inhibition compared to classical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs\n      (NSAIDs). If this could be confirmed, metamizole would be a valuable alternative for\n      treatment of painful conditions in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, the aim\n      of this study is to examine the effects of metamizole on renal function in comparison with\n      the non-specific COX-inhibitor naproxen."
