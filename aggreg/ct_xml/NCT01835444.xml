  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reallocation of healthcare is one solution to the problems healthcare is facing. In the
      Netherlands reallocation of care to Physician Assistants (PAs) hasn't adequately been
      studied. Given the growing number of PAs, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness and
      efficacy of (Dutch) PA services.

      This multicenter matched-controlled study aims to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of
      substitution of hospital ward care from medical doctors (MDs) to PAs. The traditional model
      in which the role of house officer is taken by medical doctors MD model) will be compared
      with a mixed model in which a PA functions as house officer together with a medical doctor
      (PA/MD model). Hospital wards will be matched on medical specialism and hospital type (i.e.
      academic;non-academic). On the basis of USA studies, it is hypothesized that the mixed PA/MD
      model compared to the MD model reduces the costs of healthcare, while improving or
      maintaining the clinical outcomes, patients and provider satisfaction, and continuity and
      quality of care.

      Primary research question:

      • What is the effect of 'mixed PA/MD model' compared with 'MD model' on efficiency of care?

      Secondary research questions:

        -  What is the effect of 'mixed PA/MD model' compared with 'MD model' on clinical and
           patients outcomes?

        -  What is the effect of 'mixed PA/MD model' compared with 'MD model' on continuity of
           care?

        -  What is the effect of 'mixed PA/MD model' compared with 'MD model' on nurses and
           (specialist) medicals doctor experiences?

        -  What are the barriers and facilitating factors considering the implementation of PAs as
           house officer?

    <description>Relevant costs associated with the principal admission (length of hospital stay, resource use, consultation of health care suppliers, salaries) and costs that occurred  after discharge (unplanned readmission, presentation at emergency departments, visits of general practitioner, required home care) will be calculated, considering a follow-up period from admission until 1 month after discharge. All volumes will be collected in detail at an individual patient level, primarily from medical patient records and patient and care provider questionnaires. Medical costs will be calculated by multiplying the volumes of healthcare use with corresponding unit prices, derived from the Dutch Manual for Costing Research</description>

    <description>To estimate the quality of ward care, a set of objective indicators has been developed through literature review and clinical input from a physician panel. We have selected both clinical indicators and process indicators, with a follow-up period of maximum 1 month after discharge. Clinical indicators were based on the national set of indicators for quality of hospital care from the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ) and consider the incidences of inhospital mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, unplanned readmission, presentation at emergency department after discharge,unplanned transfer to Intensive Care Unit, development of hospital infections, pressure sore and fever, and pain scores . Process indicators are the number of days between a patients discharge and the date of written turnover to general practitioner or other hospital, and acquaintance with the patient within 24 hours after admission</description>

Objective workload will be measured by calculating the ratio between number of working hours at the hospital ward, and the number of patients the PA or medical doctor is responsible for.</description>
