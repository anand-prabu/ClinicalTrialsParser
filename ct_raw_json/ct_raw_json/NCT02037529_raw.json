Patients will be randomized between the experimental and control arm with\n      equal allocation (1:1) within strata defined by prior adjuvant taxanes, hormone receptor\n      status, and line of therapy. Subjects will continue protocol directed therapy until\n      documentation of disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of\n      consent. Those who discontinue study treatment without radiological progression will be\n      followed with repeat imaging studies every 12 weeks. All subjects will be followed until\n      death, withdrawal of consent, or study termination."
