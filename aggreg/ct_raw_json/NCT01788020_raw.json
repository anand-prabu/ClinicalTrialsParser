Thus innovative\n      approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in patients with WM,\n      who are mostly of advanced age. The immunochemotherapy DRC (dexamethasone, rituximab,\n      cyclophosphamide) was shown to be highly effective in patients with WM without inducing\n      major hematological toxicities. On the other hand the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib showed\n      substantial activity as a single agent in WM with only very few side effects when given in a\n      weekly schedule. Based on these observations it is the aim of this study to test whether the\n      efficacy of the well tolerated DRC regime can further improved by adding Bortezomib."

The clinical understanding of the  disease has been greatly improved\n      by the identification of internationally recognized criteria for initiating therapy 2, the\n      description of an international prognostic index for patients requiring a first-line\n      therapy3 and the definition of response criteria. These criteria are mainly based on the\n      evolution of serum IgM concentration4. However, delayed IgM monoclonal protein responses may\n      cause important difficulties in response assessment4. In addition, discrepancies between the\n      kinetics of serum M protein reduction and the clearance of  monoclonal B-cells from the bone\n      marrow have been reported 5. Despite continuing advances in the therapy of WM, the disease\n      remains incurable with a median survival of 5 to 8 years from the time of diagnosis thereby\n      necessitating the development and evaluation of novel treatment approaches."
