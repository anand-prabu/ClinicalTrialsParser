      Background:

      - Ocular melanoma is the most common cancer of the eye in adults. One possible treatment for
      it involves collecting white blood cells from the person with cancer and growing them in a
      laboratory. The cells can then be given back to the donor to help attack the cancer. This
      study will use chemotherapy to prepare the immune system before this white blood cell
      treatment. After receiving the cells, the drug aldesleukin (IL-2) may be given to help the
      cells stay alive longer.

      Objectives:

      - To see if chemotherapy and white blood cell therapy is a safe and effective treatment for
      advanced ocular melanoma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced ocular melanoma.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  White blood cells will be collected from tumor cells. These cells will be collected
           during surgery or a tumor biopsy.

        -  Participants may have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood cells for the
           procedure.

        -  Participants will have 1 week of chemotherapy to prepare their immune system to accept
           the white blood cells.

        -  Participants will receive an infusion of their collected white blood cells. They will
           also receive aldesleukin for up to 5 days to boost the immune system's response to the
           white blood cells. They will remain in the hospital until they have recovered from the
           treatment.

        -  Participants will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the
           treatment.

      Background:

        -  Metastatic ocular melanoma (OM) carries a poor prognosis with estimated survival of 4-6
           months. There are no known effective systemic therapies. Metastatic OM is classified as
           an    orphan    disease and there are currently few clinical trial options for these
           patients. Thus, novel systemic approaches are desperately needed.

        -  Administration of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) generated from
           resected metastatic cutaneous melanoma can induce objective long-term tumor responses.

        -  Minimally invasive, safe, and effective surgical approaches have been developed in the
           Surgery Branch to procure liver tumor tissue for TIL generation.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether autologous Young TIL infused with or without the administration of
           high-dose aldesleukin may result in clinical tumor regression in patients with
           metastatic ocular melanoma receiving a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative
           regimen.

        -  To study immunologic correlates associated with Young TIL therapy for ocular melanoma.

        -  To determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with metastatic ocular melanoma who are greater than or equal to 16 years of
           age, and are physically able to tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy. Patients who
           can tolerate high-dose aldesleukin will receive it following cell infusion; those who
           cannot tolerate high-dose aldesleukin due to medical comorbidities or refuse high-dose
           aldesleukin will receive cell infusion without aldesleukin.

        -  There is no requirement for prior systemic therapies, given the lack of known effective
           systemic treatments for metastatic OM.

      Design:

        -  Patients will undergo biopsy or resection to obtain tumor for generation of autologous
           TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day IV) on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine (25 mg/m2/day
           IV) on days -5 through -1.

        -  On day 0 patients will receive between 1x109 to 2x1011 young TIL and then begin high
           dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses) or no aldesleukin
           if they are not medically eligible to receive it.

        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 4-6 weeks after the last
           dose of aldesleukin in the aldesleukin arm and 4-6 weeks after the cell administration
           in the no aldesleukin arm.

        -  Patients will be enrolled into two cohorts. The cohort receiving high-dose aldesleukin
           3 (cohort A) will be conducted using a small optimal two-stage Phase II design,
           initially 19 patients will be enrolled, and if 4 or more of the first 19 patients have
           a clinical response (PR or CR), accrual will continue to 33 patients, targeting a 35%
           goal for objective response. For the cohort that will not receive aldesleukin (cohort
           B), the study will be conducted as a Minimax two-stage phase II trial. Initially 12
           evaluable patients will be enrolled to this cohort, and if 1 or more the first 12 have
           a response, then accrual would continue until a total of 21 patients, targeting a 20%
           goal for objective response.

               9. Serology:

                    -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated
                       in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                       seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less
                       responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its
                       toxicities.)

                    -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C
                       antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be
                       tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

                    -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
                       because of the potentially dangerous effects of the preparative
                       chemotherapy on the fetus.

              10. Hematology

                    -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm3 without the support of

                  time the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients    toxicities
                  must have recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia
                  or vitiligo).

        Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks, as
        long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less or as specified in the
        eligibility criteria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a
             positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac
             arrhythmias, obstructive or

             restrictive pulmonary disease.

          3. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
