The pediatric i-gel and LMA Supreme\n      are  new supraglottic airway device for children. It is made of a soft, gel-like elastomer\n      with a noninflatable cuff. Studies about I-gel and LMA Supreme in adults have been\n      promising, showing an easy insertion, high airway leak pressures, and low complication rates\n      with few postoperative complaints. The aim of this study is to compare clinical performance\n      of the pediatric i-gel and LMA Supreme in infants."
