Although\n      there are many imaging techniques for this purpose, sensitivity and specificity of these\n      techniques still remains to be low.Preoperative detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis and\n      involvement of lymph nodes beyond D2 may prevent surgical procedures.\n\n      Removal of the determined lymph nodes according to the type of the surgery is the accepted\n      surgical method. However, accurate determination of malignant lymph nodes may prevent\n      dissection of some groups of the lymph nodes. These findings may cause a new definition of\n      gastric lymph node dissection."
