            "textblock": "Osteoarthritis and early degenerative cartilage lesions has a significant impact on our\n      society. People are both living and are more active for longer and so their demands are\n      greater. This is having a direct effect on our economy from days missed off work and greater\n      dependency on state resources.\n\n      The limited regenerative capacity of cartilage is part of this problem. Existing\n      degenerative lesions lead to accelerated deterioration of the articular (joint) surface\n      leading to end-stage arthritis. Any solution that can delay or reverse this process is\n      therefore desirable. A number of non-invasive solutions do exist to treat painful knees that\n      improve functionality but with varying rates of success. Two of the more promising agents\n      are hyaluronic acid (HA) and platelet rich plasma (PRP). HA is widely applied in clinical\n      practice with good results in many studies. HA forms part of the inflammatory process that\n      can lead to the regeneration of cartilage in defective areas of the knee.\n\n      PRP uses reparative growth factors taken from the patient's own blood to create an\n      environment in the knee conducive to wound healing that can fill cartilage defects. It's\n      autologous origin, easy preparation and safety profile makes it a potentially ground\n      breaking treatment option for knee cartilage defects and osteoarthritis.\n\n      These solutions work to improve the localised environment of morbidity and so for this\n      reason are best administered as intra-articularly. As PRP is still in the earlier stages of\n      its development, its exact dosage is still to be determined. HA has also recently been\n      prepared as a higher concentration solution to test if there are any benefits to this.\n\n      Trials have compared these two products. No randomised controlled trials exist making our\n      proposed research important.\n\n      Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference between HA and PRP in treating patients\n      will articular lesions.\n\n      We will attempt to answer our research question by means of a randomised trial as there have\n      been no trials to date that have proposed to clarify this clinical question. The reason for\n      choosing a randomised trial is that it will take the quality of our research findings to a\n      higher level than already exists in the literature. PRP will be compared with HA as these\n      are two products with similar objectives. HA has been used for longer and has a more proven\n      clinically successful track record. Selected participants will be randomised to receive\n      either HA or PRP intra-articular injections.\n\n      Patients will be sourced from GP referrals to our knee unit clinic at the Alexandra Spire\n      Hospital. Post-arthroscopy patients or existing follow up patients that satisfy the\n      inclusion criteria will also be offered a place in our trial. Selected patients will be\n      given a participant information sheet to read that will explain all about the trial. They\n      will meet an investigator (doctor) to answer any queries and sign a consent form if they so\n      wish.\n\n      Upon inclusion they will fill out a scoring questionnaire, be randomised and receive their\n      corresponding injection. PRP recipients will have a sample of blood taken as is the\n      requirement for the procedure.\n\n      They will then be followed up in clinic at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months where they will have\n      to fill in a scoring questionnaire each time. The trial will therefore last from inclusion\n      of our first patient until the last patient is followed up for one year."
