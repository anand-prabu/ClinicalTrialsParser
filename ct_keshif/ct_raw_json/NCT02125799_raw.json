In the present\n      open label trial the investigators intend to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of a\n      novel aHF-rTMS protocol (i.e., 2 daily sessions over 2 consecutive weeks; 6,000 pulses per\n      day). For this, depressed outpatients will receive the aHF-rTMS protocol and will be\n      assessed at baseline and at weeks 3 and 9 with several clinician- and patient- reported\n      measures as well as with computerized neurocognitive tests."
