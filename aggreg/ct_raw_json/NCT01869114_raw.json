To determine the pharmacodynamic effect of sirolimus on inhibition of mammalian target of\n      rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in adults with high-risk MDS, or relapsed or refractory AML or\n      those unable or unwilling to tolerate high dose chemotherapy.\n\n      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of sirolimus and azacitidine in adults with\n      high-risk MDS, or relapsed or refractory AML or those unable or unwilling to tolerate high\n      dose chemotherapy.\n\n      III. To determine the progression free survival and overall survival in adults with\n      high-risk MDS, or relapsed or refractory AML or those unable or unwilling to tolerate high\n      dose chemotherapy.\n\n      IV. To determine if the quality of life of patients is improved with the combination of\n      azacitidine and sirolimus when compared to historical controls of azacitidine alone.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-10 or 1-12 and azacitidine intravenously\n      (IV) on days 4-8, 11, and 12 or days 4-10.
