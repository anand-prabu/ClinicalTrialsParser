Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. It is not yet known whether combining mitomycin or porfiromycin with radiation therapy\n      is more effective in treating patients with head and neck cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus\n      either mitomycin or porfiromycin in treating patients with head and neck cancer."
