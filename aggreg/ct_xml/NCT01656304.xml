    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well giving bevacizumab works in treating patients
      with relapsed prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of prostate cancer by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response with avastin (bevacizumab) therapy
      in androgen independent non-metastatic prostate cancer.

      II. Toxicities associated with avastin therapy. III. Time to PSA progression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival of androgen independent non-metastatic prostate cancer patients treated
      with avastin.

      II. The change in PSA velocity with avastin therapy in androgen-independent non-metastatic
      prostate cancer.

      III. Time to distant metastatic disease. IV. Circulating tumor cell count. V. Changes in
      levels of N terminal collagen peptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase with avastin
      therapy.

      VI. Correlation of crosslinked N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) and serum
      B-Cell-Specific Activator Protein (BSAP) levels with time to PSA progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once every 14 days.
      Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <description>Toxicity rates will be summarized by point estimates and Wilson type 80% confidence intervals.

    <description>TTPP will be measured from protocol registration to appearance of PSA progression as defined by the criteria of the PSA Working Group response criteria. The end point for progression will be calculated at the time a 25% increase in PSA has been achieved. PSA velocity will also be calculated as change in PSA doubling time pre and post therapy and the rate of PSA rise pre- and post-therapy.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A histologic diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.

          -  No evidence of bone/visceral metastases as visualized on standard imaging such as
             bone scan, chest X-ray, CT scan or MRI of abdomen and pelvis.

          -  PSA-only progression despite androgen deprivation therapy. PSA progression is defined
             as 3 rising levels, with a minimum interval of 2 weeks between each determination.
             The last determination must have a minimum value of

             1ng/ml and be determined within two weeks prior to registration. If the second or
             third confirmatory value is less than the previous value, the patient will still be
             eligible if a repeat value (No. 4) is found to be greater than all the prior values.

          -  If patient has been on antiandrogen in the past 28 days, then PSA progression after
             withdrawal period (28 days for flutamide and 42 days for bicalutamide or nilutamide)
             is required.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  No prior avastin therapy.

          -  No investigational or commercial agents or therapies (except LHRH agonists) may be
             administered concurrently with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy. Patients
             on LHRH agonists must continue the use of LHRH agonist therapy. Bisphosphonates can
             be administered per treating physician discretion.

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since prior systemic therapy, except for LHRH
             analogue therapy and steroids. If steroids are being used for therapy of prostate
             cancer, these should be discontinued prior to starting avastin therapy.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent that is
             approved by the Institutional Human Investigation Committee.

          -  Use of effective means of contraception in subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;150 and/or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg on antihypertensive medications).

          -  Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure (see
             Appendix E).

          -  History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within last 12 months prior to
             study enrollment.

          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Known CNS disease.

          -  Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection).

          -  Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Patients on anticoagulants are allowed if patient has been on therapy for at least 4
             weeks and patient has no acute thromboembolic activity.

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within. 28
             days prior to study enrollment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure
             during the course of the study.

          -  Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular
             access device, within 7 days prior to study enrollment.

          -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal
             abscess within 6 months prior to study enrollment.

          -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          -  Proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by:

             1. Urine protein:creatinine (UPC) ratio ≥ 1.0 at screening

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any component of avastin.

          -  Refusal to use effective means of contraception.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to avastin.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with immune deficiency such as HIV-positive patients or those receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of lack of
             safety data for avastin in these patients.
