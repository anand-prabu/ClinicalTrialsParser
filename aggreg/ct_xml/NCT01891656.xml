  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance abuse treatment in the criminal justice system can reduce drug use and related
      criminal behavior.  Although drug and alcohol treatment are common mandates in criminal
      justice programs, only a minority of clients actually initiate treatment.  This proposal
      will compare two intervention formats that target motivation to initiate and engage in
      treatment among a group of probationers who have drug or alcohol treatment conditions.  Six
      hundred drug and alcohol offenders in two probation sites (Baltimore, MD and Dallas, TX)
      will be randomized to receive: 1) an in-person motivational interviewing session (MI), 2) a
      motivational computer program (MC), or 3) supervision intake and monitoring as usual (SAU).
      The MI condition will be structured along the lines of the &quot;Check-Up&quot; format which consists
      of an assessment and personalized feedback delivered in an MI style; the content of the MC
      condition will be drawn from previous literature on effective motivational computer
      programs.  Both interventions will be delivered at the start of the probation process, with
      follow-up assessments at 2 and 6 months.  Primary outcomes include engagement and
      participation in substance abuse treatment; secondary outcomes include drug and alcohol use,
      probation progress, criminal behavior, and HIV testing and care.  This project will be the
      first to develop and test two interventions for encouraging criminal justice clients to
      follow through with treatment recommendations, with the goal of increasing treatment
      initiation, and reducing subsequent drug use and criminal behavior.  It also contributes to
      ongoing partnerships with two large probation agenciesâ€”the Dallas County Supervision and
      Corrections Department and the Maryland Division of Parole and Probation.

      Specific Aims

        -  Develop two intervention formats (Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Motivational
           Computer (MC)) for increasing motivation to initiate and engage in substance abuse
           treatment and/or HIV / AIDS testing and, if appropriate, HIV care.

        -  Test the efficacy of MI and MC on treatment initiation and participation, substance
           abuse, HIV testing/care, and recidivism, as compared to Supervision As Usual (SAU);

        -  Evaluate offender characteristics (e.g., risk level, gender, ethnicity, motivation) as
           potential moderators of the intervention effect; and,

        -  Assess the relative cost and cost-effectiveness of MI and MC on substance abuse
           treatment and/or linkage to or participation in HIV/AIDS care, supervision outcomes,
           recidivism, and substance abuse.

    <description>Participants randomized to the MI group will receive a single 60-minute MI session focused on motivation to initiate and engage in treatment. The MI session will be organized around the &quot;Check-Up&quot; format, with additional planning components as desired by the client.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the SAU group will receive the standard agency intake process as well as baseline and follow-up research interviews, but will not receive any additional intervention as part of the study.

    <description>Participants randomized to the MC group will complete a 60 minute computer intervention focused on motivation to initiate and engage in treatment.  The program will be self-guided, interactive, and to the extent possible, will mirror the features of MI session. The MC program will have two main components: a motivation component and a planning component.</description>

    <intervention_name>Motivational Interviewing</intervention_name>
    <description>MI is a &quot;client centered, directive style of interacting with a person to help explore and resolve ambivalence about change&quot; (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002). MI borrows from Client-Centered Counseling in its emphasis on empathy, optimism, and respect for client choice (Rogers, 1961). MI also draws from Self-Perception Theory, which says that a person becomes more or less committed to an action based on the verbal stance he or she takes (Bem, 1972). The effects of MI tend to be in the small-to-medium range when compared to no treatment, and nonsignificant when compared to more extensive treatment.</description>

    <description>The growing use of technology has led to the development of automated interventions for behavior change, including some that target drug and alcohol use (Elliott, et al, 2008; Lustria, et al, 2009; Revere &amp; Dunbar, 2001; Walters, et al, 2006) and treatment interest (Lieberman &amp; Massey, 2008). As discussed by Hester &amp; Miller (2006), automated interventions have several potential advantages over face-to-face interventions: (I) They require little or no staff contact, which may increase cost-effectiveness; (2) they can allow for automatic data collection and follow-up; and (3) they can be disseminated with little loss of fidelity.</description>
