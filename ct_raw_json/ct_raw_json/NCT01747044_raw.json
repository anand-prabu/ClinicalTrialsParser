            "textblock": "Fibromyalgia affects 0.7 to 3.3% of the adult population and 7-10 times more women than men.\n      In France, the prevalence is 1.6% according to a French study conducted in 2009 and\n      published in 2011 by Serge Perrot et al.\n\n      The definition of fibromyalgia was recently amended with particular consideration of\n      cognitive and somatic symptoms, factors not involved in the initial criteria of the ACR\n      classification. Several factors are in favor of a malfunction of the central modulation of\n      pain and poorer performance noxious inhibitory controls descendants (DNIC: diffuse noxious\n      inhibitory controls) have been demonstrated. In fibromyalgia patients, the DNIC (diffuse\n      noxious inhibitory controls) are altered with less pain inhibition than controls.\n      Dysfunction of the central pain modulation is widely described in the literature and\n      contributes to pain complained of fibromyalgia.\n\n      According to the Recommendations of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2006,\n      antidepressants have a genuine analgesic efficacy in controlled studies. Milnacipran is an\n      antidepressant known and used in major depressive disorder according to its marketing\n      authorization but is also part of the molecules used in the treatment of chronic neuropathic\n      pain and fibromyalgia according to the recommendations of the EULAR. A review included five\n      double-blind studies on 4,000 participants who took 100 mg or 200 mg milnacipran or placebo\n      over a period of 8 weeks to 24 weeks. A moderate response was obtained for 40% of\n      participants treated for each dose of milnacipran on the criteria of \"at least 30% pain\n      relief\" Impression and global change. Substantial improvement with milnacipran compared to\n      placebo has been shown.\n\n      To date, the link between the weakening of DNIC in fibromyalgia and effectiveness of drug\n      treatment has not been shown.\n\n      This study aims to assess the degree of impairment of DNIC in fibromyalgia patients may be\n      predictive of the efficacy of milnacipran."
