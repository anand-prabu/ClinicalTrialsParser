  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apathy, defined as a quantitative reduction of voluntary, goal-directed behaviours (GDB), is
      a core component of negative symptoms. It has been suggested that the physiopathology of
      apathy is not a single entity but may be multiple, depending on which specific process or
      macrofunction is disrupted during completion of GDB. In line with this notion, Levy and
      Dubois proposed dividing apathic syndromes into three subtypes of disrupted processing:
      'a-motivation', 'cognitive inertia', and 'uncoupling'. In schizophrenia, apathy has been
      associated with executive dysfunction, functional impairment and poor outcome. However, the
      neurobiological underpinnings of apathy in schizophrenia are poorly understood.

      Primary objective: confirm that chronic schizophrenic patients are apathic compared to
      healthy volunteers

      Secondary objectives:

        -  investigate if apathy is related to a particular aspect of the disease (i.e. negative,
           positive symptomatology and/or deficit form)

        -  investigate if apathy correlates with executive dysfunction

        -  investigate if apathy is associated with a specific mechanism using an experimental
           task specially designed to investigate the different mechanism (i.e. 'a-motivation',
           'cognitive inertia', and 'uncoupling')

        -  investigate if there is a volumetric abnormality affecting the executive system in
           apathic schizophrenic patients

        -  link these eventual volumetric abnormalities to prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia
           circuits according to a specific subtype of apathy in the apathic schizophrenic group
