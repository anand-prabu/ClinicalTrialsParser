  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will seek and recruit substance-using Black Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) in New
      York City for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing and will link and retain those who
      are HIV infected in HIV primary care. The STAR study has two primary objectives: to evaluate
      the feasibility and effectiveness of Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) in the substance using
      Black MSM population for identifying individuals who are HIV infected and not in care余 and
      to assess the relative effectiveness of patient navigation and financial incentives in
      linkage and retention to HIV care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HIV epidemic in the United States most severely affects men who have sex with men (MSM):
      61% of all new infections occur in this population. Black MSM bear a disproportionate
      burden, with prevalence of 28%, in contrast to 19% in MSM overall. Black MSM undergo HIV
      testing less frequently than other MSM余 are less likely to be aware that they are HIV
      infected余 are more likely to experience delays in entry into HIV care余 and are less likely
      to be prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) when eligible. These disparities are
      pronounced in substance-using MSM, as substance users are at elevated risk of late diagnosis
      and delayed engagement in HIV care. The combination of pervasive stigma associated with MSM
      behavior and high rates of substance use hinders effective prevention efforts in this
      population, even as the prevalence of infection in Black MSM in some US cities approaches
      50%. Reducing HIV-related disparities in MSM and among Black Americans are National HIV/AIDS
      Strategy priorities and are essential to the effort to control and prevent HIV/AIDS in the
      US.

    <description>We will calculate dollars per patient linked and retained in care to measure cost-effectiveness of the two linkage/retention interventions: costs administering the incentives for the financial incentives arm and staffing costs for the peer navigation arm. All such values will then be adjusted by the opportunity cost of each participant's time. In addition, we will include fixed costs (eg, pamphlets and teaching materials to train the navigators) and the cost of space required to host the navigators.</description>

    <description>Patient Navigation is defined as an individual relationship between a navigator and participant to promote retention in the continuum of HIV care . For this study, three experienced navigators will be hired. Their primary role will be to ensure that participants are linked to an HIV primary care provider, that they attend at least one scheduled visit within three months of receiving a confirmed HIV diagnosis, and that they are retained in care (as defined by attending three HIV visits within nine months of diagnosis). To promote linkage to HIV care, navigators will help participants identify material and other barriers to accessing care and will work with participants to overcome those barriers.</description>

    <description>After confirmation that they have completed their first HIV primary care visit, Financial Incentive participants will receive a gift card. Additionally, the coordinator will flip a coin and give participants a bonus gift card if the coin flip comes up heads. Participants who attend the second HIV primary care visit will receive a gift card. Patients who attend a third HIV primary care visit will receive a gift card. Study staff will be responsible for confirming participants' attendance at appointments.</description>
