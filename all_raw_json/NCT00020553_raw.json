            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if families who participate in a video support program function\n      better as a family in the areas of communication, togetherness, and overall increased\n      ability to cope when a parent is newly diagnosed with cancer. II. Determine if participation\n      in this program decreases stress-related illness in the well members of the family. III.\n      Determine the safety of this program. IV. Determine patient/family and medical provider\n      satisfaction with this program.\n\n      OUTLINE: This a randomized study. Adult parent participants and spouses undergo a baseline\n      assessment over approximately 1 hour comprising completion of a self-assessment form\n      followed by an interview. Families are then randomized to one of two arms. Arm I: Adult\n      parent participants receive a video support program comprising 3 videotapes (parent tape,\n      adolescent tape, and child tape) and a parent guidebook. The parents are encouraged to\n      screen the videotapes and decide whether to have their child and/or adolescent view the\n      program. Arm II: Adult parent participants receive no video support material. Families may\n      view the video program after study completion. Adult parent participants in both arms\n      complete follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 weeks. This clinical trial is being conducted at\n      the locations listed below. If you are interested in this clinical trial but unable to visit\n      these locations, please call #1-800-848-3895 ext. 226 and ask for more information about the\n      We Can Cope study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 families will be accrued for this study."
