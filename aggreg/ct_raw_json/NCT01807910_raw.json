The investigators plan to examine this hypothesis\n      in a well-characterized cohort of obese subjects that are scheduled for bariatric surgery.\n      Methyl-D9-choline chloride will be infused before and after a 2-week high fructose or\n      glucose feeding to determine the biosynthesis and kinetics of secretory lipoprotein\n      phospholipids.  It is proposed that phospholipid metabolism play an important role in the\n      pathogenesis or etiology of fatty liver in non-alcoholic conditions through mechanisms that\n      invoke ER and oxidative stress responses."
