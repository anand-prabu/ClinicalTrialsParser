The study assesses one factor related to nicotine patches with\n      3 levels:  sending patches directly from the Helpline, providing vouchers that can be\n      redeemed for patches, and usual care. A second factor is counseling plus materials versus\n      materials only.  This proposed study has the following specific aims:\n\n        1. To demonstrate that a voucher for free nicotine patches will increase the quit rate for\n           smokers who do not have access to free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)\n\n        2. To demonstrate that sending patches directly from a quitline would outperform sending\n           vouchers for free NRT, since the vouchers impose an additional barrier to those who\n           want to quit\n\n        3. To determine the effect of telephone counseling in the context of nicotine patch\n           distribution and if any interaction effects exist between counseling and patch\n           conditions"

            "textblock": "Tobacco smoking leads to nicotine dependence and serious health consequences. Telephone\n      counseling has been shown to improve smokers' chances of quitting and is the most accessible\n      of the three evidence-based forms of counseling (individual face-to-face, group, and\n      telephone). It is well established that offering free NRT can attract many more smokers to\n      call a quitline. However, how much the offer of free NRT helps quitline callers quit\n      successfully is less well documented. There is currently no consistent guideline for\n      quitline practice. We want to determine whether two weeks' worth of starter kit nicotine\n      patches is efficacious for smokers who don't have access to free nicotine patches or\n      quitting aids. The study also will provide data regarding the impact of a barrier to\n      obtaining quitting aids by contrasting a direct mailing condition with a voucher condition.\n      Further, the study will help us determine the effect of telephone counseling in the context\n      of nicotine patch distribution and if any interaction effects exist between counseling and\n      patch conditions\n\n      The study uses a randomized controlled design. Smokers who call the Helpline during the\n      recruitment phase, who meet eligibility requirements for the trial and give consent will be\n      randomly assigned to one of six groups along two factors (nicotine patch and telephone\n      counseling), as described below.\n\n      The 6 randomized groups are as follows:  Group 1: Materials, Group 2: Voucher + Materials,\n      Group 3: Patches + Materials, Group 4: Counseling, Group 5: Voucher + Counseling, Group 6:\n      Patches + Counseling\n\n      Two months and seven months after their initial contact with the Helpline, all participants\n      will receive two Assessment Interviews by phone. The interview will cover, as appropriate,\n      smoking status, use of nicotine patches and other quitting aids, history of quitting, and\n      satisfaction with services provided. The Assessment Interview lasts from 5-10 minutes."
