    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Treatment fidelity comprises two dimensions: adherence to the procedures of IPT and level of competence in applying these procedures. These dimensions will be rated separately, and the scores will be combined to form the primary outcome.</description>

    <description>Eating Disorder and Depression psychopathology will be assessed using a separate count of binge eating and purging (including episodes of self-induced vomiting, episodes of laxative and diuretic use, and episodes of fasting defined as 24 hours without food) for eating disorders and items from the SCID and the PHQ-9 for Depression. This measure correlates well with data obtained from structured interviews. This measure will allow us to test the relationship between fidelity to IPT and client outcome.</description>

    <description>Trainers in the high intensity condition will attend two separate workshops at Washington University in St. Louis designed to teach participants to conduct IPT and then to train IPT.
Following participation in the first, two-day workshop, each trainer will return to their site and be encouraged to treat two Eating Disorder cases, audio recording each session.
Trainers will then return to Washington University to be trained in how to train their other staff members in IPT.</description>
