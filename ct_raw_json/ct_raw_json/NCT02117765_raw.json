            "textblock": "In type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune defense cells in the body attack and destroy\n      insulin-producing beta cells leaving affected people with a lifelong need for daily insulin\n      injections. Even with insulin injections, blood glucose (sugar) control is imperfect and\n      leads to many health complications and a shortened life span. This is a pilot clinical trial\n      to test the safety of a drug, ustekinumab, in 20 adult subjects with recent-onset T1D.\n      Ustekinumab is currently licensed for use in psoriasis where it has proven to be both highly\n      effective and safe and so the investigators hope to see a similar effect in T1D. This trial\n      will also be used to determine the best dosage and frequency of the drug to be given to\n      people with T1D to help design future studies on the drug's effectiveness. The investigators\n      hope that if the drug can block immune cells soon after the development of diabetes, any\n      remaining insulin-producing cells may be protected, and regenerate, thus producing more\n      insulin so that individuals may be insulin free, or require less insulin."
