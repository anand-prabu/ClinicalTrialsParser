Mine tailings containing heavy metals are stored in large\n      piles up to 200 feet in height.  Ottawa County is home to 8 Indian tribes and much of the\n      mine waste is on tribal land.  Specifically, the study will: a) integrate existing Native\n      American youth programs with the existing lay health advisor intervention (Society of Clan\n      Mothers and Fathers) to form an inter-generational intervention, b) expand the existing lay\n      health advisor intervention to address cadmium in addition to lead, c) use participatory\n      research methods to involve tribal youth and adults in an air monitoring study, d) assess\n      the extent to which the intervention contributes to belief, attitude and behavior changes\n      that will reduce heavy metal exposure and absorption in Native American children; and e)\n      assess the contribution of the intervention to creating changes in organizational,\n      community, tribal and government (city, county, state, federal) capacity to address heavy\n      metal contamination in Ottawa County, Oklahoma."
