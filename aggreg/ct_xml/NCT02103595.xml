    <textblock>
      German Multi-centered, randomized, crossover study in diabetic patients evaluating two
      infusion sets under real life conditions at home. Subjects will be randomized to use one of
      the infusion set devices during the first period of 4 weeks, and be switched to the other
      infusion set for the second period of 4 weeks.

          -  Continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy (CSII) for at least 3 months

          -  Insulin pump compatible with Luer lock infusion set (Accu-Chek, Disetronic, Animas,
             Deltec Cozmo and Minimed 506 to 508)

          -  Sufficient potential infusion sites suitable for the usage of a cannula length of 8
             mm and a tubing length of 70 and 80 cm

          -  Willing to measure blood glucose at least 4 times per day and 1-3 hrs after each new
             insertion

          -  Willing and able to participate and comply with study procedures including the
             general recommendation of shifting infusion sets (at least every 3 days)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significantly impaired awareness of hypoglycemia

          -  A history of or high risk of ketoacidosis during CSII therapy

          -  Frequent catheter abscesses in the past year, as per investigator´s discretion

          -  Known strong plaster incompatibility and/or allergy (history of catheter use)

          -  Unstable chronic disease other than diabetes

          -  Chronic use of steroids in adrenal suppressive doses, other immuno-modulatory
             medication or chemotherapy

          -  Acute illness or abnormality at the time of screening rendering the patient not
             suitable to participate in the study in the opinion of the Investigator
