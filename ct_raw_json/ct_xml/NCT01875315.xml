  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate that a new approach to cardiac
      stress imaging that combines treadmill exercise with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
      provides valuable clinical information in a cost-effective manner.

    <description>Patients will undergo either Stress CMR or stress Nuclear testing.  For each individual patient, the cost of the initial test, the subsequent follow-up costs, and the total costs over the follow-up period will be calculated. Total costs will be collected for direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect costs. Direct medical costs will include those applied for medications, imaging, invasive therapies and healthcare services; as well as costs resulting from side effects or complications from each of the testing strategies. Direct non-medical costs will include those incurred due to CAD-related illness or the need to seek care, such as caregiver costs and patient transportation costs. Indirect costs, will be defined as lost productivity due to time lost from work, early death or disability.</description>
