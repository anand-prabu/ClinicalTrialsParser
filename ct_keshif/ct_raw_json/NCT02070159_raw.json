            "textblock": "Although clopidogrel together aspirin has been a backbone of anti-platelet therapy in\n      coronary artery disease patients, clopidogrel has several limitations. It has delayed onset\n      of peak concentration and pharmacodynamic inter-patient response variability resulting in\n      high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR). Those demerits are known to be associated with\n      adverse cardiovascular outcomes.\n\n      Prasugrel has a more effective metabolism pathway than clopidogrel and exhibits more rapid\n      and potent platelet inhibition. Recent guidelines recommend prasugrel as a first line\n      antiplatelet agent or put precedence over clopidogrel for the patients with acute coronary\n      syndrome. However, there have been concerns of different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic\n      response to prasugrel in East Asian ethnicities.\n\n      In addition, lower loading dose of prasugrel exhibited more potent pharmacodynamic effect\n      than clopidogrel 600 mg with comparable efficacy compared to conventional loading dose of\n      prasugrel in healthy Korean subjects.\n\n      The investigators compare the antiplatelet effect of lower loading dose of prasugrel 30 mg\n      with conventional loading dose of clopidogrel 600 mg and prasugrel 60 mg in Korean coronary\n      artery disease patients undergoing elective coronary angiography."
