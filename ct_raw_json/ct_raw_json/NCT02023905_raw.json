Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its\n      potential to prevent tumor cells from growing and multiplying.  Specifically, there is a\n      protein called mTOR that we think helps many tumors to grow, and everolimus blocks the\n      effect of mTOR.  Temozolomide is also an anticancer agent that prevents tumor cells from\n      growing and multiplying. About 159 people total will take part in this study.  Patients will\n      be assigned to one of three treatment groups depending on the results of some tests done on\n      their tumor.  Each group will have 53 patients in it.  2 groups will receive treatment with\n      everolimus alone, while the third group will receive treatment with both everolimus and\n      temozolomide. In this study, patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on\n      two characteristics of their tumor, called \"1p/19q\" (this is a test of the tumor\n      chromosomes) and \"p-PRAS40\" (this is a test of a pathway in the tumor called mTOR).  If the\n      patient's tumor is 1p/19q intact and p-PRAS40 positive, the patient will be assigned to\n      Treatment Arm 1, and the patient will receive everolimus alone.  If the patient's tumor is\n      1p/19q intact and p-PRAS40 negative, the patient will be assigned to Treatment Arm 2 and the\n      patient will receive everolimus and temozolomide.  If the patient's tumor is 1p/19q\n      co-deleted, regardless of the p-PRAS40 result, the patient will be assigned to Treatment Arm\n      3, and the patient will receive everolimus alone."
