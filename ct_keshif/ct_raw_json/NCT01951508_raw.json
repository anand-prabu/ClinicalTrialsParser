            "textblock": "Methylphenidate and modafinil are increasingly used as performance enhancers or \"smart\n      drugs\" by students. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\") is widely used as\n      recreational drug to enhance emotions. We plan to investigate effects of these\n      psychostimulants on emotion-processing and cognitive performance using functional magnetic\n      resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Single doses of methylphenidate (60mg), modafinil\n      (600mg), MDMA (125mg), or placebo will be administered before an fMRI scan in a\n      placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study design in 24 healthy subjects. Subjective\n      emotional effects, sociability, neurohormonal, cardiovascular responses, and plasma drug\n      concentrations will also be assessed and analyzed for potential brain-induced changes in\n      brain activity in networks processing emotions. The primary hypothesis is that these\n      psychostimulants differentially affect processing of emotional stimuli and potentially\n      leading to alterations in social cognition and behavior. The work should clarify the\n      neuropharmacological basis of the potentially differential effects of these drugs. This\n      information will improve our understanding of the neurofunctional effects of\n      methylphenidate, modafinil, and MDMA, and inform the ongoing debate surrounding brain doping\n      with cognitive and mood enhancers."
