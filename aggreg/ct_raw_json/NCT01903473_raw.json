At present, patients receive steroid treatment to\n      combat this tricky situation. Nevertheless, some patients do not respond to this therapy.\n      Recently, it has been shown that immune system cells having defensive capacities can help in\n      preventing the occurrence of a GVDH.\n\n      This study aims to evaluate if these protective cells together with a non-standard\n      immunosuppressor can improve the clinical condition and suppress the activity of the\n      offensive cells in the graft."
