            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain\n      stimulation that involves the application of brief  weak electric current to the scalp. tDCS\n      may induce neuroplasticity, thereby engaging some of the same systems that figure\n      prominently in the pathological neuroplasticity caused by addictive drugs.\n\n      OBJECTIVE:  To assess whether tDCS delivered in addition to standard smoking cessation\n      treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy and nicotine patch) reliably increases quit rates.\n\n      METHOD:  Active (20min; 2mA) and sham (30sec; 2mA) stimulation will be applied to the\n      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in both cerebral\n      hemispheres.\n\n      HYPOTHESES:\n\n        1. Active tDCS (20-min; 2 mA) will increase abstinence in a standard smoking cessation\n           protocol relative to a sham procedure when combined with cognitive-behavioural group\n           therapy plus nicotine patch.\n\n        2. The benefits of active tDCS to the OFC (anode-left/cathode-right) will be greater than\n           the (anode-left/cathode-right)DLPFC configuration.\n\n        3. The benefits of active tDCS (anode-left/cathode-right) to the OFC and to the DLPFC will\n           be greater than of active tDCS in the reverse configuration (cathode-left/anode-right)\n           to the respective regions."
