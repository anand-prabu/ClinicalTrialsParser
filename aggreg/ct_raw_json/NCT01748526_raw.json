During Period 1, volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either\n      200 mg (Treatment A) or 300 mg (Treatment B) of canagliflozin on Day 1. During Period 2,\n      volunteers will receive the dose of canagliflozin (Treatment A or B) that they did not\n      receive during Period 1. The duration of each treatment period will be 4 days and each\n      treatment period will be separated by a 14 day washout period (when no medication is given).\n      Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 45 days."
