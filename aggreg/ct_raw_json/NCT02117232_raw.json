The discomfort\n      and pain are mostly caused by air insufflation and intubation difficulties during\n      advancement of the colonoscope in order the reach the cecum.\n\n      Study Hypothesis: Use of the \"Visualization\" Balloon will facilitate advancement of the\n      colonoscope and will eliminate the need for colonic distention with the air or CO2, which\n      can shortened the length of the procedure, reduce patient's discomfort and can decrease\n      amount of sedatives and analgesics used during colonoscopy."

To compare procedure time and effectiveness of the \"Visualization\" Balloon  colonoscopy\n           with traditional CO2-insufflation colonoscopy.\n\n        2.

Total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas for colonic insufflation used during the\n           procedure.\n\n        2. Ease of colonoscope insertion.\n\n        3.
