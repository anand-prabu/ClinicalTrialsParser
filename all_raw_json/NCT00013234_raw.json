This investigation builds on that fundamental\n      diagnostic information by assessing the health services implications of a teledermatology\n      consult system.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      To investigate health services outcomes related to teledermatology implementation.  Outcomes\n      of interest were time to diagnosis and treatment initiation, the proportion of patients that\n      avoided the need for a clinic-based encounter, and an economic analysis.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Patients referred from the primary care clinics to the dermatology consult service were\n      randomized to either usual care or a teledermatology consultation.  A usual care\n      consultation consisted a conventional text-based electronic consult request.  A\n      teledermatology consultation included digital images and a standardized history, in addition\n      to the electronic text-based consult.  Consultant dermatologists, reviewing the consult\n      requests for both modalities, decided when, and if, a referral required a clinic-based\n      evaluation.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Final report has been prepared and is in the review process at this time."
