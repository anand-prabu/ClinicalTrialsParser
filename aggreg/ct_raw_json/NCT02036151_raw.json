Saliva sampling was performed before conducting the clinical examination between 9-11 am. Children were not allowed to eat or drink for 2 hours before sampling.  Saliva was collected with the pipette supplied by the dentocult (CRT) kit. (Ivoclar Vivadent, Lichtenstein). Saliva sample was not taken if the child has received antibiotics within 1 month prior the examination. Screening of stimulated saliva samples for mutans streptococcus (MS) level were carried out using the dentocult method (CRT). Findings of 105 CFU or more of MS indicates a high caries risk, whereas findings less than 105 CFU is considered low caries risk.",
