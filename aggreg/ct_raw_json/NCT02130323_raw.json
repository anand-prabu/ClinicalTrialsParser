However, it has\n      been recognized that these procedures can increase the risks for pre-term labor in women who\n      still desire to conceive. Recent studies have shown that medical treatment with Imiquimod, a\n      topical immune response modulator, has significant effects on histological regression of CIN\n      2-3 when compared with placebo. The investigators propose that treatment with Imiquimod may\n      be preferable offering similar outcomes on histological regression when compared with\n      excision or ablation while potentially avoiding or reducing the number of surgical procedure\n      that places them at risk for future pregnancies."
