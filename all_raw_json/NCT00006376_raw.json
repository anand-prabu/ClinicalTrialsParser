Determine the safety of\n      this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the time to disease progression in\n      these patients with this treatment regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours for 21\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment repeats every\n      28 days for at least 2 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study."
