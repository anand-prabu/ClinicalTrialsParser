      This study will test whether a tailored, online educational intervention increases HPV
      vaccine uptake and intent among female college students.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Me First is the first web-based, online, educational tool designed to promote Human
      Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine awareness and understanding in an effort to improve HPV vaccine
      intent and uptake among female university students. HPV is the most common sexually
      transmitted infection and causes genital warts and cancer. The HPV vaccine has been
      recommended for girls ages 11-26 since 2006, yet vaccination rates remain low. Tailored
      online interventions may be more effective tools to promote behavior change among college
      students than traditional static interventions. The proposed study is a randomized
      controlled trial testing the efficacy of the Me First tool vs. standard static educational
      material on increasing HPV vaccination intent and uptake among female university students
      aged 18-26.
