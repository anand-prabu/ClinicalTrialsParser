Therefore, we would like to study the genetic materials from you as part\n      of the study. We will compare the DNA sequence from people with certain clinical features\n      (observable characteristics, determined by both genes and environment) and/or treatment\n      responses to the DNA from people without those clinical features and/or medication treatment\n      responses to find the DNA sequence differences that exist. By combining this information\n      with information from your medical records, it may be possible to identify the genetic\n      changes that influence people's responses to different medical treatments. This project\n      could lead to more knowledge about why certain people respond differently to a treatment.\n      With such knowledge, future treatments potentially could become customized to a patient's\n      unique genetic make-up.\n\n      You will be one of participants enrolled in this research."
