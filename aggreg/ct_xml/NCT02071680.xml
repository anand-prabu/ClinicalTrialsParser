  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia.  Symptomatic patients are
      generally treated with antiarrhythmic agents or undergo catheter ablation. Patients undergo
      catheter ablation to control or eliminate their arrhythmia.  Catheter ablation consists of
      inserting catheters from the groin into the inside of the heart to deliver pulses of energy
      (radiofrequency current) to areas of heart tissue. Certain nerve endings, ganglionated
      plexuses (GP), release neurotransmitters, both parasympathetic and sympathetic, thought to
      be related to the initiation or continuation of atrial fibrillation (AF).  The signal
      pathways are interrupted with the ablation procedure, with the goal of eliminating the
      arrhythmia. Localizing the GPs is done with a special catheter which isolates the
      electrogram signals using High Frequency Stimulation (HFS). Recently, non-invasive nuclear
      imaging using D-SPECT technology and 123I-mIBG has shown that localized positive images of
      123I-mIBG coincide well with expected anatomical regions of GPs in the atrium. 123I-mIBG is
      an iodine based radioisotope that is chemically similar to norepinephrine (NE) which
      regulates the sympathetic nervous system. The mapping of the areas to be treated can
      potentially be enhanced using the visual 123I-mIBG scan in conjunction with the catheter
      that measures electrical signals. This 123I-mIBG scan can also potentially be used following
      the ablation procedure to assess the effectiveness of the procedure to see if any areas are
      still seen as positive.

      The investigators hypothesize that there will be concordance between the Carto® mapping
      system with HFS and the 123I-mIBG visual imaging in the identification of GP's in
      participants with atrial fibrillation.

      This is a single centre, interventional, Phase III trial using 123I-mIBG imaging to
      investigate the relationship between visual uptake of 123I-mIBG and targeted regions
      associated with HFS of GPs.

      The objective of our study is to evaluate the relationship between imported 123I-mIBG maps
      (which provide a visual map of atrial cardiac innervation), with catheter recordings of
      electrograms and thresholds associated with HFS of ganglionated plexuses (standard of care
      to physiologically document autonomic function). Furthermore, using a clinically approved
      catheter that provides the ability to measure contact force, we will be able to correlate
      the (endocardial) contact force required or associated with thresholds required to identify
      (epicardial) ganglionated plexuses. This will be followed by the clinical ablation
      procedure, as discussed by the cardiac electrophysiologist, consisting of pulmonary vein
      (PV) isolation, with additional ablation of regions of autonomic innervation, and sites
      showing complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) when clinically indicated.

    <description>D-SPECT Imaging procedure:
A single injection of the 123I-mIBG will be given. Imaging will be done twice following injection: at 0-60 minutes and 3-5 hours. The timing is dependent on the specific participant and imaging characteristics.
The imaging is done for approximately 24 minutes at each time point.</description>
