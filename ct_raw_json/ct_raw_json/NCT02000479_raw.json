            "textblock": "1. Background and study aims During the last decades, the prevalence of (pre)diabetes but\n           also of chronic heart failure (CHF) has increased dramatically. Somehow, both\n           conditions are linked, but the mechanisms involved have not been completely clarified\n           yet. It is clear that the presence of (pre)diabetes in CHF patients affects morbidity\n           and mortality. Although feasibility, safety and beneficial effects of exercise training\n           in CHF are generally acknowledged, its effects on insulin resistance are not well\n           understood. Therefore, the presented study aims to investigate the effect of ET on\n           insulin resistance and the possible link with cardiac function, exercise tolerance,\n           muscle strength and body composition in CHF patients.\n\n        2. What does the study involve?\n\n           A randomized controlled study (n=30) will be performed over a period of 12 weeks.\n           Following study inclusion, baseline measurements will be performed in 1 week. They\n           include:\n\n             -  a maximal exercise test on a bicycle ergometer to assess exercise tolerance,\n\n             -  two oral glucose tolerance tests to assess fasting and post-exercise insulin\n                resistance,\n\n             -  a venous blood sample to determine HbA1c, blood lipids, BNP,\n\n             -  a muscle strength measurement on a isokinetic dynamometer,\n\n             -  assessment of body composition  via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry,\n\n             -  cardiac echography,\n\n             -  questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life,\n\n             -  a questionnaire (IPAQ) and a pedometer (3 days) to assess physical activity.\n                Following baseline measurements, subjects will be randomized to a control group\n                (CON, n=10) and an exercise intervention group (EX, n=20), matching for gender and\n                reduced/preserved ejection fraction and glucose tolerance. Hereafter, CON will\n                receive usual care and will be advised to maintain their normal lifestyle, EX\n                subjects will be enrolled in a 12-week training program. Following 6 (MID) and 12\n                (POST) weeks of exercise training including progressive training load adaptations,\n                 baseline measurements will be repeated in all patients.\n\n        3. What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\n\n             -  Benefits: patients receive a free training program with personal and professional\n                supervision. After completing the study, they receive a report with personal\n                results and evaluation of training effects.\n\n             -  Risks: the usual risks of exercise tolerance testing and exercise training in a\n                CHF population are limited because training sessions are held in the supervised\n                conditions of the Jessa hospital and because training characteristics are\n                according to guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. Exposure to x-rays\n                during body composition assessment is very low, almost negligible."
