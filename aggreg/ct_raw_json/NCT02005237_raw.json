Some\n      evidence from animal studies and small clinical trials suggest that aerobic exercise might\n      beneficially affect cognitive function in MS. The aim of this randomized-controlled trial is\n      to explore if an aerobic exercise training program can enhance cognition in MS. In addition,\n      we will employ neuroimaging markers to determine if exercise alters measures of brain\n      structure and function.\n\n      Patients will be randomly assigned to either a 3-months exercise program (bicycle ergometry,\n      2-3 session per week) or a waitlist control group. The primary endpoint of the study is a\n      test of verbal learning and memory. Secondary endpoints include neuroimaging markers of\n      functional and structural connectivity in the brain. We hypothesize that exercise will\n      improve verbal learning and memory and beneficially affect measures of brain connectivity."
