  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the concentration dependent effects of OZ439 on the clearance
      of P. falciparum parasites in patients, specifically the determination of an in-vivo minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) of OZ439. Characterisation of PK-PD
      (Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic) relationships is essential for rational evidence based
      dosing. The adaptive investigation of a range of doses will provide the best chance of
      accurate PK-PD characterisation, allowing the observation of Plasmodium falciparum growth
      dynamics and the subsequent identification of MIC and MPC (minimum parasiticidal
      concentration). Additionally the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of OZ439 will be
      confirmed. The PK/PD relationship between OZ439 exposure and subsequent effects on
      parasitaemia will be investigated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients between the age of 18 and 60 years, inclusive

          2. Body weight between 45 kg and 90 kg inclusive

          3. Presence of mono-infection of P. falciparum confirmed by:

               1. Fever, as defined by axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C or oral/rectal/tympanic
                  temperature ≥ 38°C, or history of fever in the previous 24 hours (history of
                  fever must be documented) and,

               2. Microscopically confirmed parasite infection: 1,000 to 75,000 asexual parasite
                  count/µL blood.

          4. Written informed consent, in accordance with local practice, provided by patient. If
             the patient is unable to write, witnessed consent is permitted according to local
             ethical considerations

          5. Ability to swallow oral medication

          6. Ability and willingness to participate and access the health facility

          7. Agree to hospitalization for at least 72h until parasites have fallen below the level
             of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection and have no signs or symptoms of
             malaria; and then to return once daily to the study centre for blood sampling for
             quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and rehospitalisation when qPCR levels
             are detectable.

        Exclusion Criteria:
