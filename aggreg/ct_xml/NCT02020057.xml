  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, there has been no information on in vivo clinical results of posterior
      cruciate-substituting arthroplasties using highly cross-linked polyethylene. We evaluated
      whether the clinical and radiographic results, incidence of post fracture of the tibial
      polyethylene insert, failure of the locking mechanism of the tibial polyethylene insert, and
      the incidence of osteolysis would be similar between posterior cruciate-substituting total
      knee prostheses using conventional and highly cross-linked polyethylene.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  osteoarthritis that was severe enough to warrant total knee arthroplasty after an
             adequate trial of nonoperative therapy, and the need for bilateral total knee
             arthroplasties

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  inflammatory arthritis

          -  osteoarthritis of the hip causing pain or restricted mobility

          -  a foot or ankle disorder which limited walking

          -  dementia or a neurological disorder including a past history of stroke which affected
             mobility
