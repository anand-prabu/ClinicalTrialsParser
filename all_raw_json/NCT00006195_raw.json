Undesirable changes in blood sugar control, or glucose\n      regulation, and type 2 diabetes can occur more commonly in individuals with schizophrenia\n      compared to healthy subjects and subjects with other psychiatric conditions.  While\n      abnormalities in glucose regulation were first reported in schizophrenia before the\n      introduction of antipsychotic medications, antipsychotic treatment may contribute\n      significantly to abnormalities in glucose regulation.  Attention to the way that\n      antipsychotic medications may affect glucose regulation has increased as doctors have become\n      more concerned in general about disease- and drug-related medical complications, including\n      weight gain during antipsychotic treatment."

Each subject will undergo a 4\n      hour glucose tolerance test.  In addition, there will be a small project within the overall\n      study to measure the effects of risperidone and olanzapine on glucose regulation as the\n      individuals switch from their prior treatment with a conventional antipsychotic medication\n      to either risperidone or olanzapine. Ten subjects will be studied on a typical neuroleptic\n      at baseline then switched over a one week period to risperidone or olanzapine.  The\n      participants will be evaluated at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks, prospectively.  Each\n      evaluation will consist of a 4  hour glucose tolerance test."
