            "textblock": "-  The cause of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders (TMD) remains unknown and therapy\n           is usually empirical. Systematic reviews have concluded that currently there is no\n           evidence that occlusal adjustment has any therapeutic or preventive effect on\n           temporomandibular disorders. However, these reviews also indicate that evidence to the\n           contrary has not been provided and that more research is needed to elucidate whether\n           there is any benefit of occlusal adjustment treatment for TMD. The risk factors for\n           chronic unilateral TMD include a steeper condylar path, flatter lateral anterior\n           guidance, and habitual chewing on the affected side. Consequently, a new occlusal\n           therapy is proposed to restore the physiological jaw closure and masticatory function.\n\n        -  The primary end point of the trial is to assess the efficacy of the new occlusal\n           therapy on the affected side TMD pain, and the maximum mouth opening. Efficacy is\n           demonstrated by showing significantly superior pain relief and increasing maximum mouth\n           opening (when it was limited) with the active treatment compared with placebo.\n\n      Phase III, single center, randomized, parallel-group, single-blind with blinded assessment,\n      placebo-controlled clinical trial.\n\n        -  A linear mixed model will be performed for comparisons of most variables and a logistic\n           regression model will be used to measure the probability/risk of change on the chewing\n           side between baseline and six months; in addition, McNemar's test may be used.\n\n        -  Interim analysis plan and stopping rules. The study will employ an interim analysis\n           plan with a single interim analysis after 70% of participants have completed the\n           six-month follow-up visit. Using the Lan-DeMets version of the O'Brien-Fleming stopping\n           rule, the critical value for statistical significance at the interim analysis (under\n           both intention-to-treat and per-protocol sets) will be +2.438, corresponding to a\n           nominal two-sided P value of 0.0146."
