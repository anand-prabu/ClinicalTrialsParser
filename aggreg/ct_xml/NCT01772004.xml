    <description>MSB0010718C (anti PD-L1) will be administered in study location using a protocol-defined dose escalation scheme until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or if any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or investigational medicinal product occurs. After determination of the dose and regimen for Expansion Phase, MSB0010718C will be administered to subjects divided into 3 primary cohorts of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer and metastatic breast cancer (MBC); and 4 secondary cohorts of colorectal cancer (CRC), castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), melanoma, and ovarian cancer.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for dose escalation and expansion phase:

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Male or female subjects aged greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Subjects must have histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally
             advanced solid tumors, for which no standard therapy exists or standard therapy has
             failed. Availability of tumor archival material or fresh biopsies is optional for
             subjects in dose escalation

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 at trial entry
             and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Disease must be measurable with at least 1 uni-dimensional measurable lesion by
             RECIST 1.1, except for subjects with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer
             (mCRPC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who may be enrolled with objective evidence
             of disease without a measureable lesion

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol

          -  Effective contraception for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception
             exists

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Inclusion Criteria for expansion phase:

        • Subjects must have relapsed, refractory, or progressive disease following last line of
        treatment. Availability of tumor archival material or fresh biopsies is mandatory for
        eligibility in the expansion cohorts. For subjects in the MBC cohort, the biopsy or
        surgical specimen must have been collected within 90 days prior to the first
        investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration. Specifically, the following will
        be required:

          -  NSCLC: Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB (malignant pleural
             effusion) or stage IV NSCLC that has progressed after 1 line of platinum-containing
             doublet chemotherapy. Subjects should have received only 1 line of
             platinum-containing treatment for metastatic disease (i.e., adjuvant treatment with a
             platinum-containing regimen is not sufficient for eligibility because not received in
             the context of a metastatic disease). Subjects in the NSCLC cohort will not be
             enrolled in countries in the European Union

          -  Gastric and GEJ cancer: Histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced or
             metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastric and gastro-esophageal junction, treated with
             first-line chemotherapy combination without disease progression. Subjects should not
             have been treated with trastuzumab (but can be Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor
             2 [HER2] positive). Patients who received any platinum containing doublet or triplet
             as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy, but are not ultimately candidates for surgery
             will also be eligible, as long as they did not have progressive disease after
             completion of the adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, subjects with gastric cancer
             can enter in the study if their white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte count is as
             defined in the protocol

          -  MBC: Subjects must have histologically confirmed locally advanced or MBC and have
             tumor that is refractory to or progressive after standard of care therapy. Subjects
             must have received no more than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for metastatic
             disease. Subjects must have received a taxane and an anthracycline, unless
             contra-indicated

          -  Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer
             (mCRPC), melanoma and ovarian cancer as defined in the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria for dose escalation and expansion phase:

          -  Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug

          -  Prior therapy with specific antibody/drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins
             (immune checkpoints)

          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment concurrent systemic therapy with steroids or other
             immunosuppressive agents, or use of any investigational drug within 28 days before
             the start of trial treatment. Short-term administration of steroids  (that is, for
             allergic reactions or the management of immune-related adverse events [irAE]) is
             allowed. Note: Subjects receiving bisphosphonate are eligible provided treatment was
             initiated at least 14 days before the first dose of MSB0010718C

          -  Previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy to be investigated in
             this trial within the last 5 years with the exception of basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ

          -  Rapidly progressive disease (for example, tumor lysis syndrome)

          -  Active or history of central nervous system metastases

          -  Receipt of any organ transplantation including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation

          -  Significant acute or chronic infections as defined in the protocol

          -  Active or history of any autoimmune disease (except for subjects with vitiligo) or
             immunodeficiencies

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies, any history of
             anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy greater than Grade 1 NCI-CTCAE v4.0,
             however sensory neuropathy less than or equal to Grade 2 is acceptable

          -  Pregnancy or lactation period

          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Clinically significant (that is, active) cardiovascular disease

          -  All other significant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease), which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, might impair the subject's tolerance of trial
             treatment

          -  Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of
             informed consent

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity

          -  Non-oncology vaccine therapies for prevention of infection disease (for example,
             seasonal flu vaccine, human papilloma virus vaccine) within 4 weeks of study drug
             administration. Vaccination while on study is also prohibited except for
             administration of the inactivated influenza vaccine
