      This clinical study will assess efficacy and safety of indacaterol (150㎍ o.d.) in patients
      with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with destroyed lung by tuberculosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are few clinical studies in patients with COPD with destroyed lung by tuberculosis
      because tuberculosis patients are usually excluded from (phase II or III) clinical trials
      for drug registration although they are not prohibited from prescription of COPD drugs.

      This clinical study will assess efficacy and safety of indacaterol (150㎍ o.d.) in patients
      with COPD with destroyed lung by tuberculosis.

             guidelines (2009)

          -  Patients with at least one finding of destructed pulmonary parenchyma in the chest
             X-ray and the sum of all legion volumes equivalent to over 1/3 of one lung

          -  Patients with a history of tuberculosis and no change in the chest imaging test over
             the past one year

          -  Patients who can voluntarily sign an Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of any

             basal body temperature, menstrual cycle contraceptive method, etc) but means use of
             contraception which must include one of barrier contraceptive methods.

             e.g.) condom (barrier contraceptive method), diaphragms (barrier contraceptive
             method), oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, Depo injection, etc.

          -  Patients who have been admitted to hospital for COPD worsening within 6 weeks prior
             to visit 1

          -  Patients with a history of respiratory infection within 6 weeks prior to visit 1

          -  Patients requiring long-term oxygen therapy (&gt;15 hours/1 day) for chronic hypoxemia
             (it is allowed to use up to a total of 10 out of 24 hours on a PRN basis)

          -  Patients with a history of asthma

          -  Unstable ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia (except for stable ventricular
             fibrillation) and uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Patients with a history of long QT syndrome or whose QTc interval measured at Visit 2
             is prolonged: &gt;450 ms (males) or &gt;470 ms (females)

          -  Uncontrolled hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism

          -  Hypokalemia: plasma potassium level &lt; 3.0 mEq/L

          -  Patients with creatinine level ≥2 the upper limit of normal

          -  Patients with AST/ALT level ≥2  the upper limit of normal

          -  Patients with lung cancer or a history of lung cancer

          -  Patients with active cancer or a history of cancer with less than 5 years
             disease-free survival (whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or
             metastases; localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin without metastases is
             acceptable).

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs
             with similar chemical structures including untoward reactions to sympathomimetic
             amines or inhaled medication or any component thereof.

          -  Patients who have had live attenuated vaccinations within 30 days prior to Visit 1

          -  Patients who have had treatment with investigational drugs, within 30 days or 5
             half-lives prior to Visit 1, whichever is longer.

          -  Patients unable to successfully use a dry powder inhaler device, metered dose inhaler
             or perform spirometry measurements

          -  Other cases which are considered ineligible for this clinical study by the principal
             investigator and subinvestigator
