The study explored whether risperidone reduced cocaine use, cocaine\n      craving, and cocaine subjective effects in patients on methadone maintenance who abused\n      cocaine and whether it had an acceptable side effect profile.

In\n      the second six-week phase (weeks 7-12), patients crossed over to the opposite treatment.\n      During weeks 13-18, Group 1 patients remained on placebo while Group 2 patients were tapered\n      from risperidone to placebo.  For six weeks after the end of the trial, patients were\n      offered routine clinical treatment with counseling and psychiatrist visits as needed.\n      Medication dosage was titrated upwards on a fixed-flexible schedule to a maximum dose of 4\n      mg per day.  Medication began at \u00bd mg risperidone for 3 days, then 1 mg for four days, 2 mg\n      per day during week 2, 3 mg per day during week 3, and 4 mg per day during weeks 4-6.  The\n      titration schedule for risperidone in weeks 7-12 was the same as for weeks 1-6.  In addition\n      to treatment as usual, patients received a modified manual-guided relapse prevention\n      counseling program in weekly meetings lasting approximately 20 minutes; these sessions\n      provided cognitive and behavioral skills that were found to be helpful to patients in\n      reducing cocaine use."
