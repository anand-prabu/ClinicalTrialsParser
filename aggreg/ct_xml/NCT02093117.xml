  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures experience higher rates of
      postoperative respiratory failure compared to the broader surgical population.
      Lung-protective ventilation strategies, including alveolar recruitment maneuvers may be
      beneficial. Despite this potential benefit, the effect of high levels of continuous airway
      pressure on intracranial pressure, brain swelling and cerebral perfusion must be defined
      prior to applying this intervention to the neurosurgical population.

      Objectives. The primary objective is to determine the effect of an alveolar recruitment
      maneuver on subdural pressure in patients undergoing supratentorial tumour resection. The
      secondary objectives are to determine the effect of an alveolar recruitment maneuver on 1)
      brain bulk score and 2) cerebral perfusion pressure in patients undergoing supratentorial
      tumour resection.

      Hypothesis. The investigators hypothesize that an alveolar recruitment maneuver of 30 cm of
      water over 30 seconds will not result in a clinically-important (&gt;3 mmHg) increase in
      subdural pressure.

      Methods. This single center, randomized, cross-over study will enroll 30 ASA I-III patients
      scheduled to undergo supratentorial brain tumour resection at Vancouver General Hospital.
      All patients will receive a standardized general anesthetic including invasive blood
      pressure monitoring. After removal of the bone flap, subdural pressure will be measured
      using a sterile 22-guage plastic cannula. Brain bulk will be assessed using a validated
      4-point scale. After baseline arterial and subdural pressure determination and brain
      swelling assessments, patients will be randomized to receive either a recruitment maneuver
      of 30 cm of water for 30 seconds or a sham recruitment maneuver of 5 cm of water for 30
      seconds. Maximal subdural pressure and minimum MAP during the maneuver will be noted, and
      the neurosurgeon will be asked to score the brain bulk. After a 2-minute equilibration
      period, the protocol will be repeated with the alternate group allocation.

      Statistical Analysis. Our sample size calculation, based on our primary outcome (subdural
      pressure), determined that a sample size of 30 patients would allow us to detect a
      difference of 3 mmHg in subdural pressure assuming a type I error of 0.05, a type II error
      of 0.2 and two-sided significance testing. The subdural pressure during the recruitment
      maneuver as compared to the sham maneuver will be analyzed using a paired t-test. The brain
      bulk score will be compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. All data analysis will be
      performed with STATA 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (greater than 18 years of age) scheduled for craniotomy for resection
             of a supratentorial brain tumour who are American Society of Anesthesiologist's class
             I to III are eligible to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with altered level of consciousness or unstable/deteriorating neurologic
             status preoperatively will be excluded.

          -  In addition, if the neurosurgeon considers the mass effect too great to safely
             participate the patient will be excluded. Baseline subdural pressure will be measured
             prior to randomization

          -  Patients with a subdural pressure greater than 20 mmHg will be excluded.

          -  Other exclusion criteria include significant cardiac disease (e.g. ejection fraction
             &lt; 40 percent, significant valvular disease, pulmonary hypertension), sepsis,
             hypovolemia and prior lung resection or history of pneumothorax.
