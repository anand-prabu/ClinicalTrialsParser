HMGB1 is a nuclear protein acts as a transcription factor, but, if\n      it was released to the outside of cells by damaged cell or necrotic tissues, it works as\n      cytokines for promoter of inflammation and cancers. at this point, there are no reported\n      articles about correlation of HMGB1 and aGVHD in human. recently, we have seen excessive\n      secretion of serum HMGB1 in mouse model, then base on this results, we will check\n      correlation of HMGB1 and aGVHD in human."
