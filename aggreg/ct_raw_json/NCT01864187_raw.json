In China, it is a relatively new\n      drug. And as the population of obesity becomes larger, but whether the pharmacokinetics of\n      the drug in Chinese who are obese is the same to normal people is unknown. So the\n      investigators design this research to study the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine in\n      obesity."

And venous samples will be collected in\n      different time points. Next the investigators can get the plasma concentration of\n      dexmedetomidine by the use of HPLC-MS. And then the plasma concentration could be analyzed."
