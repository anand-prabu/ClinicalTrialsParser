Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting\n      of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and ifosfamide in treating patients who have ovarian or testicular\n      germ cell tumors that are refractory to platinum-containing chemotherapy."

Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously\n      (SC) on days 7-18 or until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients receive paclitaxel at the\n      MTD.\n\n      After completion of chemotherapy, some patients may undergo resection of residual masses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-43 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
