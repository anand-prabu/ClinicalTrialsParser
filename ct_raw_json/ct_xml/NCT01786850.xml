  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer in most of cases cannot benefit from
      percutaneous ablation modalities, due to high risk of procedure-related complications.
      Ultrasound-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation has been introduced as a
      feasible treatment option in these patients. However, in other anatomical regions US-guided
      HIFU has been replaced by the more accurate MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation,
      but the applicability of this latter technique to the treatment of pancreatic cancer is
      still unexplored. The aim of this study is to explore feasibility and clinical performance
      of MRgFUS ablation of unresectable pancreatic cancer. Two are the main end-points: Pain
      palliation and local tumor control.

      As compared to conventional US-guided HIFU, MRgFUS could represent a more accurate,
      non-invasive ablation modality even for unresectable pancreatic cancer although, to date, no
      cases of pancreatic MRgFUS ablation have been reported.

    <description>High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive ablation technique under ultrasound (US) guidance for the treatment of solid tumors. Differently from other ablations, HIFU induces tissue necrosis through short (10-30s) and relatively low grade (60-80 CÂ°) thermal stimulations. Clinical applications of HIFU include uterine fibroids, prostate, hepatic and breast cancer. Selected patients with pancreatic cancer have been treated with US-guided HIFU for both pain control and tumor debulking. The development of a MR guidance for HIFU (MRgFUS) enabled to perform real-time monitoring and precise control of beam direction, temperature changes and deposited thermal dose beyond the capability of conventional US guidance. This system has been approved for the treatment of uterine fibroids and bone metastases in the United States and European Union. As compared to conventional US-guided HIFU, MRgFUS could represent a more accurate ablation modality for unresectable pancreatic cancer.</description>
