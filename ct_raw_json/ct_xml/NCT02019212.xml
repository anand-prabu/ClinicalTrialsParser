  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality and prognostic ability of low dose
      99mTc-tetrofosmin Myocardial Perfusion SPECT Imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using a
      new SPECT reconstruction software and a low dose (LD) of 99mTC-tetrofosmin will provide
      equal quality and prognostic value as a full dose (FD) of 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial
      perfusion SPECT imaging methodology.

      The images of clinical patients from the Diagnostic Imaging Department will be  assessed and
      compared for image quality and myocardial perfusion. The outcomes of participants that have
      had FD studies will be compared to those who have had LD studies. Consented participants
      will be contacted and will be asked to provide information on their cardiovascular health
      since the date of their LD or FD scan, such as non fatal myocardial infarction, death,
      congestive heart failure, admission to hospital with chest pain, further cardiac diagnostic
      testing, including angiography and early and late revascularization. The event information
      will be tabulated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for the LD and FD studies.

      The study hypothesizes that there will be no difference in the quality and prognostic value
      between the LD and FD 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT MPI imaging protocols. The study hypothesizes
      that there will be no increase in repeat diagnostic testing and angiography with using the
      LD imaging protocol.
