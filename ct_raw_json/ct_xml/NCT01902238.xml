      The present study evaluate the safety of EUS-guided ethanol-lipiodol ablation in the
      treatment of pancreatic NET, analyze the safety and efficacy in a relatively large study
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, including insulinoma, increasingly are being encountered in
      clinical practice. Management of pancreatic NET is challenging because most are asymptomatic
      but may have malignant potential, and surgical resection of pancreatic neoplasm is
      associated with substantial morbidity of 20%-40% and a mortality rate of 2%. Management
      strategy needs to be individualized, applying a risk-benefit analysis to each patient.
      Recently, pancreatic tissue ablation by EUS-guided injection of ethanol or other
      chemotherapeutic agents can be performed safely, with few procedure-related complications.
      Levy et al. demonstrated that EUS-guided ethanol ablation for insulinoma was both safe and
      feasible, and symptomatic improvement was achieved in 8 of 8 patients (100%). However,
      previous study have included only a small number of patients and evaluated only short-term
      outcomes. In addition, lipiodol permits the drug to concentrate in the tumor. To obtain an
      embolic effect and prevent washout of the ethanol, ethanol/lipiodol mixture is administered
      into the tumor. The present study evaluate the safety of EUS-guided ethanol-lipiodol
      ablation in the treatment of pancreatic NET, analyze the safety and treatment efficacy.

    <description>By using 3D-volumetric analysis, the optimal volume of ethanol is calculated by computer estimation of areas on each axial image, using EUS software permitting volume calculation. After calculating optimal ethanol volume by 3D volumetric analysis, we advance the needle into the tumor and inject estimated volume of ethanol/lipiodol (1:1 mixture), typically 1 to 1.5 ml.</description>
