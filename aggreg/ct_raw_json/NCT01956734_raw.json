            "textblock": "Phase I trial, unicentric, uncontrolled. Intratumoral injection or intramural (into the\n      resected tumor cavity) of DNX2401 into brain tissue will be followed by up to two 28 - day\n      cycles of oral temozolomide (TMZ) in schedule of 7 days on/7 days off to evaluate safety of\n      the combination.  Completion of two full cycles of TMZ will be dependent upon tolerance and\n      toxicity.\n\n      The rationale in using the virus with chemotherapy begins with the lessons learned in many\n      clinical trials in glioblastoma (GBM) about both the great difficulty of treating this\n      disease with monotherapy and the limitations of the therapeutic virus. The best clinical\n      results in recent years have been achieved with combinations of multiple therapeutics\n      efforts, including, maximum resection and chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted\n      therapies.\n\n      There are very strong preclinical data about the synergy of DNX-2401 and TMZ proposed in our\n      trial design. The dose-dense schemes of TMZ like the one we will use, have been developed\n      with the aim to saturate o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT). The published\n      results to date have shown reasonable toxicity albeit with modest efficacy' these schemes\n      are now in phase III trials. In addition, autophagy triggered by TMZ could help viral\n      replication in the tumor cells 11.\n\n      The last argument in favor of this virus + TMZ combination is the proved efficacy in killing\n      GBM tumor stem cells. In vitro and animals models have shown this combination is much more\n      effective that any of the treatments alone against GBM stem cells and the tumors derived\n      from them."
