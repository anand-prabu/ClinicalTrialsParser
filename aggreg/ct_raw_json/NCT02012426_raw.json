We further seek to demonstrate the\n      sustainability of this effect following 12- week weight loss on the weight management\n      program.\n\n        -  We hypothesise that formulated (low energy) meals will lead to decreased hunger,\n           greater fullness and reduced desire to eat compared to standard meals.\n\n        -  We hypothesise that the commercial weight management program will lead to greater\n           weight loss compared to control program.\n\n        -  We hypothesise that formulated meals (high consumer acceptance) will improve hedonic\n           control over eating (lower wanting for high fat food)\n\n        -  We hypothesise that the commercial weight management program will improve hedonic\n           control over eating (reduced experience food cravings)"
