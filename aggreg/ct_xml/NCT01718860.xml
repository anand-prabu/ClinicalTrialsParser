  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluate the assumption that postoperative residual curarization is
      associated with impaired gas exchange upon post anesthesia care unit arrival and longer
      hospital length of stay. Additionally, the investigators also evaluate the assumption the
      use of neostigmine reversal of residual neuromuscular block is associated with an increased
      incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and intensive care unit admission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' laboratory has recently identified the intraoperative use of
      intermediate-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and neostigmine reversal
      of neuromuscular blockade as independent risk factors for severe postoperative respiratory
      complications. Additionally, the investigators found that postoperative residual
      curarization (PORC), defined as a train-of-four ratio less than 0.90 upon postanesthesia
      care unit (PACU) arrival, is associated with an increased PACU length of stay.

      To examine the mechanisms contributing to the association of neuromuscular transmission
      failure with postoperative respiratory complications, the investigators aim to evaluate in a
      performance improvement driven initiative to better understand the association between the
      use of neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal agents with postoperative respiratory
      complications (see British Medical Journal 2012 Oct 15;345:e6329) if patients presenting
      with PORC develop subsequently 1) an increased incidence of postoperative impaired gas
      exchange upon PACU admission and result in 2) an increased hospital length of stay. In
      addition the investigators evaluated the effects of neostigmine on signs and symptoms of
      postoperative respiratory dysfunction and an incidence of unplanned postoperative intensive
      care unit admission.
