  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with asthma, reactions to allergens in the environment (such as mold, pollen,
      weed, domestic pets, and dust allergens) play an important role in causing asthma symptoms.
      However, upper respiratory tract infections, typically those caused by the common cold
      virus, rhinovirus, can also cause asthma to get worse. In previous studies at the University
      of Virginia, it was found that mild asthmatics, who had high levels of the allergy antibody
      (called IgE) in their blood, developed more persistent cold and chest symptoms when they
      were given an infection with rhinovirus (the most frequent cause of the common cold). The
      cold symptoms produced by rhinovirus tend to peak during the first 4 -7 days of the cold.
      These symptoms, including nasal congestion, are similar to what you have experienced with
      previous colds.

      This study is being done to learn how a common cold caused by a viral infection affects
      people with asthma. The goal is to learn how to improve the care of asthma symptoms caused
      by the common cold virus (called rhinovirus). Most adults experience one or two colds caused
      by rhinovirus every year. In addition, 75-80% of asthma exacerbations caused by viral
      infections are caused by this virus, primarily in children. Adults are less likely to
      experience significant changes in their asthma symptoms when they get colds, because they
      have developed protective immune responses from previous colds which help diminish symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Criteria for all subjects:

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and provide written informed consent

          -  Age 18 to &lt; 40 years of age, any gender, any racial/ethnic origin.

          -  Participant must be willing to comply with study procedures and requirements.
             Participant must be considered eligible for participation based on results of
             screening procedures conducted by  protocol number IRB# 12656 at the University of
             Virginia.

        Criteria for asthmatic subjects:

          -  Physician-diagnosed asthma

          -  Mild asthma as per adapted definition in the new NAEPP Guidelines for the Diagnosis
             and Management of Asthma.

          -  History of intermittent use of inhaled bronchodilators (e.g. albuterol) to manage
             their symptoms

          -  Positive Methacholine challenge test (i.e. at least 20% fall in FEV1 at a
             Methacholine concentration of ≤8 mg/ml).

          -  Total serum IgE level &gt; 600 IU/ml).

          -  Positive test for allergen specific IgE antibody by prick skin testing to dust mite,
             Alternaria, and/or ragweed for subjects challenged with RV in the fall, or positive
             tests to tree and/or grass allergens for those challenged with RV in the spring. In
             keeping with the study design goals of inoculating subjects during periods of
             allergen exposure, sensitization to other allergens (e.g., cat or dog) will also
             qualify for enrollment if subjects are currently exposed to these allergens at home.

        Criteria for non-asthmatic subjects (controls):

        • Subjects without a history of asthma or allergic disorders (e.g., allergic rhinitis,
        allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, or food allergies). This does not include
        those with hypersensitivity to drugs or insect venoms who represent a distinct genetic
        subgroup.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Criteria for all subjects:

          -  Inability or unwillingness of a participant or subject's legal representative to give
             written informed consent and HIPPA authorization

          -  Positive test for serum neutralizing antibody to RV-16 (the strain of rhinovirus used
             for this study).  Subjects with a neutralizing antibody titer &gt; 1:4 will be excluded.

          -  Chronic heart disease, lung diseases other than asthma, or other chronic illnesses,
             including primary and/or secondary immunodeficiency.

          -  An upper or lower respiratory tract infection within six weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Previous nasal or sinus surgery within the last 12 months.

          -  A history of smoking

          -  Female subjects who are, or who plan to become pregnant during the study, or who are
             nursing a baby. Additionally, to be included in this study, a woman of child-bearing
             potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening, during the run-in,
             and prior to viral inoculation and agree to use an  effective method of birth control
             such as, but not limited to, birth control pills, contraceptive foam, diaphragm, IUD,
             abstinence, or condoms.

        Criteria for asthmatic subjects:

          -  An FEV1 &lt; 70% predicted at enrollment, or at baseline prior to the inoculation with
             RV-16 (day 0) before doing the methacholine challenge test. However, to accommodate
             subjects with lower lung volumes (i.e., an FVC &lt; 88% at enrollment) an FEV1/FVC ratio
             &lt; 80% will be used as the exclusion criterion instead of the FEV1 &lt; 70% predicted
             value.

          -  Hospitalization or treatment in the ER for asthma during the last three years

          -  Intubation or management in the intensive care unit for an asthma exacerbation

          -  Subjects using inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled ipratropium bromide, an inhaled long
             acting beta agonist, inhaled cromolyn or nedocromil or systemic leukotriene modifiers
             for their asthma on a daily basis within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or subjects
             using nasal corticosteroids on a daily basis within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.
             Subjects who are currently receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents.

          -  Subjects who are currently receiving allergen immunotherapy (IT),  or who have
             received allergen IT within the last 2 years.

        Non-asthmatic subjects (controls):

          -  Subjects who have a positive methacholine test

          -  Subjects who have a total IgE level &gt; 50 IU/ml and/or a positive skin test at
             screening under IRB protocol #12656.
