            "textblock": "Burn injuries are a common presentation to A&E in the UK (175,000 per year) of whom 13,000\n      require hospital admission. Treatment of a single burn can cost more than \u00a363,000, and is\n      ultimately dependent on the depth. Most burns are assessed by experienced clinicians within\n      a few days of injury. Accurate evaluation of burn depth can be very difficult with the naked\n      eye. Inaccuracy can lead to longer hospital stays, worse scarring and greater financial\n      costs for the NHS. Where the burn depth (and the degree of damage to the underlying blood\n      supply of the skin) is not clear by visual inspection, adjuncts may be used to aid clinical\n      decision-making.  Currently, the \"gold standard\" method of assessing skin blood flow in\n      order to help burn specialists in their assessment of burn depth is Laser Doppler Imaging\n      (LDI). However, LDI machines can be very large, slow to collect the images, and a single\n      imaging unit costs roughly \u00a350,000. Consequently their use is restricted to the assessment\n      of small burns in compliant patients treated in specialist units. Thermal imaging\n      (thermography) has evolved rapidly as a useful diagnostic tool in many medical disciplines.\n      Previous studies have shown that there are significant changes in skin physiology (such as\n      temperature and pigmentation) depending on the depth of the burn. Portable, high-resolution\n      thermal cameras are now affordable, easy to use and can provide numerical results in under a\n      second.  Similarly, measurement of skin pigment levels can be achieved using portable\n      devices such as the Spectrophotometric Intracutaneous analysis scope (SIAscope).  The aim of\n      this study is to determine if alternative measures such as thermography or SIAscope can be\n      as useful in the assessment of adult burns as LDI currently is. If this study demonstrates\n      this then these results will inform further studies that would investigate these alternative\n      imaging methods as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in the management of burns not only in\n      adults but also in children presenting to non-specialised units such as A&E."

Adjuncts\n      to this process aim to inform the clinician of structural damage to the sub dermal\n      vasculature.  The current gold standard investigation is laser doppler imaging (LDI) of\n      dermal blood flow.  However, due to time and resource constraints, this technique is often\n      only applied to dermal burns of indeterminate thickness.  Thermography and the SIAscope\n      potential offer quicker, quantitative analysis with equipment currently in routine medical\n      use in other clinical disciplines.\n\n      To validate its use against the current gold standard (LDI)burns of variable thicknesses\n      will need to be assessed and compared with clinical outcome.  Consequently, in this study,\n      patients with superficial burns that would not usually require LDI will be included for\n      comparison.  All patients will be reassured that thermography, the SIAscope and LDI are\n      non-invasive, non-harmful, quick and will not affect their burn management in any way.\n      Images will be labelled by an anonymised study number and stored in on secure hospital\n      servers according to the Trust's information governance policy."
