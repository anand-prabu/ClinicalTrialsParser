            "textblock": "Roughly 140 million people worldwide are chronically exposed to As-contaminated drinking\n      water at concentrations exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 10 \u00b5g/L.\n      Arsenic is a class I carcinogen known to cause several types of cancer and ischemic heart\n      disease.  Metabolism of inorganic As (InAs), which facilitates urinary As excretion, relies\n      on one-carbon metabolism and involves two methylation steps; both utilize\n      S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.  SAM biosynthesis relies on B vitamins\n      including folate and B12 for the recruitment and transfer of methyl groups, but other\n      nutrients, including choline and betaine, also contribute to the methyl pool.  Our recent\n      findings from a cross-sectional study of Bangladeshi adults exposed to a wide range of As\n      concentrations in drinking water show that plasma choline and betaine concentrations are\n      positively associated with As methylation.  These findings suggest that choline and/or\n      betaine may play an important role in As methylation and elimination and that simple\n      interventions may have therapeutic potential for the many populations at risk for As-induced\n      health effects.\n\n      The investigators aim to recruit and follow 60 participants for this pilot study which will\n      allow us to 1) assess the acceptance of choline and betaine supplements, 2) monitor\n      participants for any potential side effects, 3) identify any difficulties that might be\n      encountered in daily follow-up, and 4) generate preliminary data regarding the effects of\n      choline and/or betaine supplementation on arsenic methylation."
