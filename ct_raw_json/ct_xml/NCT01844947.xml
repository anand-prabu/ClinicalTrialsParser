  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyse the tolerability (side effects and safety) with standard
      treatment (Javlor®) with the addition of a second anti-tumour drug: sorafenib (Nexavar®).
      This is the first time this treatment combination is studied in humans. Samples of blood,
      urine and tumour tissues will be analysed for molecular biomarkers. These biomarkers may
      potentially help us in the future in predicting whether a patient will benefit or not from
      the cancer treatment. The study also aims to investigate if a newer imaging method, called
      PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography), at an earlier stage  (than a
      normal CT scan) can identify patients who will benefit from the given treatment.

      Objectives

        -  To explore the safety of sorafenib in combination with vinflunine in patients with
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract and to define a recommended phase
           II dose for this treatment combination

        -  To correlate early tracer 18F-FDG-PET/CT functional imaging readouts with standard
           RECIST (version 1.1) evaluations with the intention to explore new endpoints for
           targeted therapy

        -  To find predictive tumour tissue biomarkers for sorafenib/vinflunine treatment

        -  To evaluate serum and urine markers of apoptosis as potential markers of
           sorafenib/vinflunine treatment

      Rationale/Goal

      To evaluate the tolerability and activity of sorafenib combined with vinflunine in patients
      with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.

      Tumour biopsies will be collected before and after one cycle of therapy. The translational
      part of this study aims to explore the predictive value of a number of biomarkers related to
      the targeted properties of sorafenib and presumptive markers for vinflunine treatment.

      In addition, the predictive value of an early functional imaging tracer 18F-FDG-PET/CT will
      be evaluated.
