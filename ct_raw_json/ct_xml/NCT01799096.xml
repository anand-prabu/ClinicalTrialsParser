  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study partially replicates two previous studies with normal weight women, and
      overweight women. Both found that women could compensate for sucrose added to the diet in
      carbonated soft drinks (4 x250ml total1800 kJ per day) when it was given blind over a period
      of 4 weeks. The hypothesis is that this applies also to obese women, who will not gain
      weight, increase overall energy intake in the diet, or eat differently whilst consuming
      sucrose. 42 participants shall be randomly assigned to either be given carbonated drinks
      that contain sucrose, or drinks that are artificially sweetened.
