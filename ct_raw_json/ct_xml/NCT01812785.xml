  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to improve the evidence-based management of fever cases seen in outpatient
      clinics in malaria endemic countries, through a better understanding of the value of
      accurate malaria diagnosis, and through an improved understanding of the other causes of
      fever in children. The objective is to describe systematically (as much as possible) the
      etiologies of fever in children in an urban and in a rural environment of sub-Saharan
      Africa.
