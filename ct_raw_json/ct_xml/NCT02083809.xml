  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is very little research to identify ways to decrease blood loss during D&amp;E
      (dilation and evacuation) procedures.  Many practitioners use uterotonics, including
      oxytocin, to help minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage yet literature and
      physiological evidence to support this practice is scarce. The investigators objective is to
      determine whether routine use of intravenous oxytocin will affect bleeding outcomes at the
      time of D&amp;E at 18-24-weeks gestation.  To evaluate the hypothesis, investigators will
      perform a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial at two sites, at University
      of Hawaii and University of Washington, on subjects who present for D&amp;E at 18-24-weeks over
      approximately a 14-month period.  Standard D&amp;E procedures will be performed by skilled
      surgeons in both the outpatient setting (in Washington) and the hospital operating room (in
      Hawaii).  In addition to the procedure, investigators will also follow a standardized
      algorithm to manage excess, intraoperative bleeding and record blood loss.  The patient will
      be followed only until discharged from the postoperative care unit during which time patient
      satisfaction, pain score and postoperative bleeding will be assessed. No additional
      follow-up after discharge home.  Primary outcome will be the rate at which providers
      intervene to control blood loss during D&amp;E procedures.  Secondary outcomes evaluated will
      include measured blood loss, complication rates, procedure length, and postoperative pain
      and satisfaction.
