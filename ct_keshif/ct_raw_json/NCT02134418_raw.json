            "textblock": "The overreaching goal of this study is to examine the influence of short CBT of irony\n      comprehension on hemispheric involvement of adults with Schizophrenia. To obtain this goal a\n       three phase study have been designed.\n\n      In the first phase all participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires screening for,\n      cognitive abilities (TONI-3 third edition), vocabulary (Hebrew adaptation of Wechsler Adult\n      Intelligence Scale-Third Edition, WAIS 3 HEB, Wechsler 1997), executive function\n      capabilities and figurative language understanding (irony and metaphor) .Theory of Mind\n      comprehension will also be assessed by using The Hinting Test (Corcoran et al.1995).\n\n      Hemispheric processing will be examined by two behavioral hemispheric experiments using\n      split visual field paradigm. The subject sits in front of a computer screen, reads a prime\n      sentence, and reacts to a  lateralized  target  word.\n\n      In the  first experiment- Idioms experiment, the target word in each trail would  be related\n      to the meaning of a preceding  prime idiom or associated to its literal meaning .The\n      participant is instructed to indicate as rapidly and accurately as possible whether the\n      target word stimulus is a meaningful word or non- word. In the second experiment- irony\n      experiment, the target word in each trail  would be a literal, ironic or unrelated ending to\n      the preceding prime sentence .Subjects would be asked to relate to the target word and to\n      indicate as rapidly and accurately as possible whether the target word stimulus formed a\n      meaningful expression with the preceding prime. Stimulus presentation and response would be\n      controlled and recorded by Super-Lab 4.5 software.\n\n      The first phase will be carried out in 1-2 sessions.\n\n      In the second phase subjects will participate in a social intervention program for\n      comprehension of verbal irony. Over the course of  intervention participants will analyze\n      and discuss short film scenario's that end with an ironic statement, and will experience\n      completing short scenario's that contain irony. Intervention will include 5 sessions, 3-5\n      subjects will participate in each group.\n\n      In the third phase participants will undergo the Irony behavioral hemispheric experiment to\n      examine changes in hemispheric processing when exposed to irony after treatment, the irony\n      and metaphor questioners and  the Hinting test. This phase will be carried out in one\n      session.\n\n      35 subjects will participate in the study, 20  in the study group and 15 in the control\n      group.\n\n      Subjects in the control group will watch the short film scenario's that end with an ironic\n      statement and rank each video for its comprehensibility and their level of enjoyment."
