            "textblock": "Retinal vasculitis is a sight-threatening inflammation that involves the blood vessels of\n      the retina, the tissue that lines the inside of the eye. This inflammation may occur on its\n      own or as a result of an infectious, cancerous, or inflammatory disorder.\n\n      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technology that can perform non-contact\n      cross-sectional imaging of retinal and choroidal tissue structure in real time. It is\n      similar to ultrasound imaging, except that OCT measures the intensity of reflected light\n      rather than sound waves.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see if non-invasive OCT technology can diagnose retinal\n      vasculitis as well as the more invasive fluorescein angiography, which requires an injection\n      of dye into the vein of an arm of a patient. The study will also compare the mapping of\n      blood vessels (angiography) and loss of blood flow (ischemia) by fluorescein angiography and\n      OCT."
