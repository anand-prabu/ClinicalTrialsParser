When three of four patients at the low dose of a vaccine have received two\n      immunizations without evidence of dose-limiting toxicity, dose escalation to the higher dose\n      of that vaccine is initiated in subsequent patient cohorts, provided all low dose arms are\n      filled. A total of six immunizations are given, at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks. Patients\n      are followed for 24 weeks after the last immunization."
