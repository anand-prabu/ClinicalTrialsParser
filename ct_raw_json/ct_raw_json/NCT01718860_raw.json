Additionally, the investigators found that postoperative residual\n      curarization (PORC), defined as a train-of-four ratio less than 0.90 upon postanesthesia\n      care unit (PACU) arrival, is associated with an increased PACU length of stay.\n\n      To examine the mechanisms contributing to the association of neuromuscular transmission\n      failure with postoperative respiratory complications, the investigators aim to evaluate in a\n      performance improvement driven initiative to better understand the association between the\n      use of neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal agents with postoperative respiratory\n      complications (see British Medical Journal 2012 Oct 15;345:e6329) if patients presenting\n      with PORC develop subsequently 1) an increased incidence of postoperative impaired gas\n      exchange upon PACU admission and result in 2) an increased hospital length of stay. In\n      addition the investigators evaluated the effects of neostigmine on signs and symptoms of\n      postoperative respiratory dysfunction and an incidence of unplanned postoperative intensive\n      care unit admission."
