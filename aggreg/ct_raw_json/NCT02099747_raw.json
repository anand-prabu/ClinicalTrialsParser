Statistical design for sample size\n      calculation: increase from 7% (control arm) to 21% (investigational arm) in 3 month complete\n      response rate (two-sided binomial test); alpha-error 0.05; power 0.8."

Male or female age > 14 years;\n\n          3. Written informed consent\n\n          4. Willing and able to comply with all of the requirements and visits in the protocol\n\n          5. Understands that they can be randomised to either treatment arm\n\n          6. Negative pregnancy test for women of child bearing age\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.

Evidence of a myelodysplastic syndrome, defined by the presence of myelodysplastic\n             features, excess of blasts or karyotypic abnormalities typical of MDS (according to\n             revised WHO 2008 criteria) [30],, as well as other primitive marrow disease. Patients\n             with diagnosis of AA with cytogenetic abnormalities which are recurrent in MDS\n             (according to revised WHO 2008 criteria) [30] should be included in this category,\n             and are not eligible for the study; patients with del(20q), +8 and -Y are not\n             included in this category, and thus are eligible for this study. The list of\n             karyotypic abnormalities which qualifies for the diagnosis of MDS are listed in the\n             Appendix.\n\n          4.

History of malignant tumors with active disease within 5 years from enrollment,\n             and/or previous chemo-radiotherapy\n\n          6.

Patients without social health care assistance\n\n         15. Patients for whom there is no availability of horse-ATG (ATGAM)\n\n         16. Participation in another clinical trial within 1 month before the start of this trial\n\n         17. Patients and/or female partners of male patients not using highly effective method of\n             birth control i.e. intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (oral pill, injection,\n             implants), tubal ligation or partner's vasectomy\n\n         18. subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the component medications\n\n        The presence of a Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria clone is not an exclusion criterion."
