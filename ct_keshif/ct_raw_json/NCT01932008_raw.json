Previous studies have showed the changes in body\n      composition, physical inactivity, decreased physical function, and poor quality of life\n      existed in patients with either cardiovascular disease or CKD. Patients concomitant with\n      cardiovascular disease and kidney insufficiency were expected to significantly increase\n      physical dysfunction. However, few studies addressed on these alterations in patients after\n      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with CKD were reported."
