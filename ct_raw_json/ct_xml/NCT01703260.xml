             Investigator).

          4. The subject has active cancer or a history of a malignant disease (except basal cell
             carcinoma) within 5 years prior to Screening or any history of bladder cancer.

          5. Subject with a history of weight loss or weight gain of &gt;10 pounds within 6 months

             relationship with a study site employee who is involved in conduct of this study (eg,
             spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress.

         24. The subject has significant results from physical examinations or clinical laboratory
             results that, at the discretion of the investigator, would make it difficult to
             successfully manage and follow the subject according to the protocol.
