The goal is to enable health care providers to provide safe supportive counseling and support services to HIV infected youth and their families. The course materials are designed to be adapted to different cultures and needs. The 14 modules cover child development, family systems, communicating with children, disclosure and adherence and legal/ethical issues. The course teaches basic counseling skills with children such as listening and play. It explores and challenges barriers to care such as caregivers' fear and reluctance to disclose an HIV positive diagnosis to a child, discussing adolescent sexuality, and practical issues such as inadequate legislation governing child rights. The curriculum was adapted for Zambia and endorsed by the MoH.  PC is considered an \"enhanced\" model of a Psychosocial Support program for OVC."

Given evidence on the link between abuse/trauma and elevated HIV risk, researchers have called for more overlap between evidence-based MH treatments like TF-CBT and HIV prevention programs. Recent trials have provided direct evidence that CBT may be effective in HIV prevention.  TF-CBT has eight components including: Psychoeducation, Relaxation, Affective Modulation, Cognitive Coping, Trauma Narrative, In-vivo Exposure (if needed), Conjoint parent-child session, and Enhancing Safety Skills. This cognitive behavioral therapy teaches skills such as how to think about situations differently in order to feel better. It also includes helping a child face the fear and anxiety of the traumatic situations, rather than avoid them. Based on earlier pilot projects, the MoH has endorsed TF-CBT in Zambia."

            "textblock": "This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of TF-CBT compared to PC\n      in improving a range of OVC outcomes including HIV risk behaviors but also mediating factors\n      which constitute important outcomes - well-being, mental health, functioning, and caregiver\n      health and support. The study design also includes measurement of the impact of factors that\n      may moderate effects - age, gender, religion, ethnicity, HIV knowledge and attitudes,\n      education, and physical health. This is an effectiveness trial in that the interventions\n      will be provided by MoH and organizations already providing services to OVC.\n\n      Assessments: Study instruments will be administered using an Audio Computer Assisted\n      Self-Interviewing (ACASI) system developed by Tufts University. The Tufts ACASI system\n      allows the responder control to navigate and answer sensitive questions privately and\n      discreetly. It was developed using Macromedia Authorware (v7.0) and can be programmed in any\n      language by having a native speaker record the screen text. The Tufts ACASI system offers\n      both live interview and data entry modes and can deliver a variety of question types,\n      including yes/no, single-answer multiple choice (select one answer), and multiple-answer\n      multiple choice (select all that apply) questions which allow numeric keypad entry, as well\n      as scale questions which allow the user to click on a point along a scale, and text entry\n      for interviewer-administered, open-ended questions\n\n      Procedure: In the first part of this study, the research staff will ask Home Based Care\n      Workers (HBCWs) of the Archdiocese of Lusaka (our partnering organization) to introduce the\n      study to families under their care. This visit can take place during the regularly scheduled\n      home visits conducted by the HBCWs. Research staff will ask the HBCWs to use a recruitment\n      script to introduce the study to both the adolescent and his/her caretaker. If the\n      adolescent and/or caretaker are not interested in hearing more about the study, their\n      information will not be passed on to study staff and we will have no contact with that\n      family. If, however, the adolescent and caretaker indicate to the HBCW that they are\n      interested in hearing more about the study, the HBCW will note their interest and schedule a\n      follow-up appointment in which they will return to the home with one of our study assessors.\n\n      Each of the study assessors (interviewers; 4-10) will then go with an HBCW to the families'\n      homes that indicated interest in the study. The assessors will present the consent forms,\n      and if the caregiver and child respond yes to the consent, they will administer the\n      screener. This screener will be scored immediately and if the child is determined eligible\n      for the study, the assessor will ask if they are able to complete the full assessment\n      battery at this time (approximately 2 hours) or if they would like to schedule a separate\n      time to complete this. If a separate time/date is preferred, the assessor will schedule that\n      with the family. Most assessors should be able to complete the screening and assessment\n      procedures for all 3-7 families expected from each HBCW in one week.  If a particular HBCW\n      has a high number of families (>=9) under their care who are interested, then an additional\n      week of assessments may be necessary.  The HBCW will not be present during the consent or\n      assessment process.\n\n      The assessor will conduct the adult consent and caretaker permission process with the\n      caretaker first.  Consent and permission will be obtained at this time for all parts of the\n      study-- screening, interview using ACASI, and intervention. In all cases, the caretaker will\n      have to provide consent to participate in the interview and intervention for him/herself and\n      will also have to provide permission for the adolescent to participate in the screening,\n      interview, and intervention. For these cases, in the response section the assessor will\n      indicate if the caretaker consents to participate in each of the sections\n      (screening/interview and intervention) separately and gives permission for their adolescent\n      to participate in each of the 3 sections (screener, interview and intervention) separately.\n\n      If the adolescent is found to be eligible after the screening interview (through the results\n      of either the adolescent screening, caretaker screening, or both), then the assessor will\n      allocate a sequential study number to the adolescent. At this time, the assessor will ask\n      the adolescent and caregiver if they are able to complete the assessment battery at this\n      time, or if they prefer to set up another day/time to complete it. When the baseline is\n      designated to be completed, the assessor will set up two notebook computers for the baseline\n      interview: one for the adolescent and one for the caretaker. The adolescent and caretaker\n      will complete the interview simultaneously but separately (in separate rooms), with the\n      assessor not present but close by in case of problems or questions. On completion of the\n      baseline interview the assessor will let the family know that someone from their nearest MoH\n      clinic will contact them. The results will be tabulated and checked at the main office, with\n      the locally based project director allocating group assignments (based on a pre-determined\n      random sequence number order sent by U.S. based PIs), and assigning counselors to families.\n      Both interventions will be available at all study sites. Neither assessor, caretaker, nor\n      adolescent will know which intervention the adolescent will receive.\n\n      This study will also enroll adolescents who do not have a primary caretaker or who live in\n      child headed households.  In these situations the person that is the caretaker has to\n      declare that he/she is the principal caregiver or they have been charged with the\n      responsibility of making sure the adolescent receives care. For any child headed households\n      or street youth, the ministry of community and social welfare should be contacted.  In these\n      cases the ministry usually has the adolescent themselves consent before they could be\n      involved.\n\n      At the end of each day all assessors will report the allocated study IDs to the on-site\n      Study Director, who will send them to the PIs who retain the confidential master list\n      linking study IDs to interventions based on random assignment (see below). She will respond\n      with the allocations for those study IDs. These data will be used to inform the clinics\n      which intervention each new participant will receive prior to their first visit.\n\n      Whether or not an adolescent agrees to join the study s/he will have access to other\n      services under the Archdiocese of Lusaka.  These services include Psychosocial Counseling,\n      Home Based Care services, medical and education support, VCT, Community Sensitization\n      Campaigns, Behavioral Change, livelihood support, TB care, awareness programs on\n      communicable diseases. The adolescent will also have access to the HIV prevention strategies\n      available at the MoH clinics including, VCT, counseling, safe sex interventions and primary\n      care services. For those in the study, we will monitor utilization of these services and\n      include that information as a variable in the analysis, to determine their effects as\n      potential moderators of treatment effects.\n\n      The adolescent will either go to a MoH clinic or a different, pre-identified community\n      center for their first appointment with their counselor to receive either TF-CBT or PC.\n      Later sessions will either be at the clinic or at another location that the counselor and\n      family agree on, and locations can vary from week to week if necessary and feasible. The\n      caretaker will also participate in these sessions (if they have consented to participate in\n      the study along with the adolescent). Because the Archdiocese of Lusaka sites are deeply\n      embedded into the community, other neighborhood structures\u2014such as churches\u2014may be used as\n      meeting points.\n\n      Follow-up Assessments with both adolescent and caretaker will be done at 0 and 6 months\n      after completion of the interventions. If one treatment shows substantially greater efficacy\n      at 6 months it will be offered to those that received the other intervention and the 12\n      month assessment will be done only with the group originally allocated to the more effective\n      intervention.\n\n      We expect to have 3-4 study contacts with research participants and their caregivers:\n\n        1. Baseline interview\n\n        2. Follow-up at 0 months\n\n        3. Follow-up interview at 6 months\n\n        4. Follow-up interview at 12 months."
