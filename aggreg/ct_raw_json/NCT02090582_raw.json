Consenting care givers will also be asked to complete\n      two questionnaires to asses the impact of structured palliative care on them every 12 weeks.\n\n      Patients will be assigned to two arms randomly: 1) usual care or 2) structured palliative\n      care. The primary endpoint is quality of life. A two-sided Chi-square test will be used to\n      compare the proportion of patients who have improved quality of life after treatment between\n      control arm and intervention arm. The average value of multiple scores after treatment will\n      be used to compare with the baseline score before treatment for each question in the\n      standard questionnaire."
