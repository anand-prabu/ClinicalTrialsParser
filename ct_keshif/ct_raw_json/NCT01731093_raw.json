Oxidative stress in\n      the brain has been linked to a variety oif disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Selenium\n      is a very powerful antioxidant that could prove useful in reducing the harmful effects of\n      oxidative stress in the brain and may help prevent diseases such as Alzheimer's. Our recent\n      work has demonstrated that the specific type of selenium compound greatly influences it's\n      ability to enhance brain health and prevent Alzheimer changes in mouse models of this\n      disease.\n\n      This study will enroll 24 participants and will allow us to test the hypotheses that\n      yeast-selenium supplementation is safe in the elderly, and that our specific formulation\n      reduces brain oxidative stress."

An additional\n      safety visit at Week 14 (two weeks after study drug discontinuation) will be required of\n      study participants.\n\n      Subjects will undergo blood draws, urine collection, assessment of vital signs, and review\n      of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) as well as changes in concomitant\n      medical conditions and medications at every visit.\n\n      Routine medical examinations will be performed at study screening and enrollment, Week 1,\n      Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 14 visits.\n\n      MRI will be performed on all subjects at Screening to ensure safety of lumbar puncture.\n      Research procedures will also include lumbar puncture at the Screening and Week 12 visits.\n\n      A designated Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will evaluate safety in the subjects who\n      have been enrolled and completed a cohort before escalating to the next cohort.  The DSMB\n      will review safety data (i.e. any AE or SAE) through Week 14.  The committee may also\n      request to review additional data.\n\n      The DSMB will also be convened in the event of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) to determine\n      whether stopping rules for accrual have been met."
