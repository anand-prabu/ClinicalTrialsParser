            "textblock": "The purpose of the study was to determine: (1) the toxicity  and maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) of  humanized anti-Tac (daclizumab),  (Zenapax(Registered Trademark))  in patients\n      with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL); (2) to define the dose of Zenapax(Registered\n      Trademark) required to saturate interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL-2R) alpha in patients with\n      ATL; (3) determine the clinical response to humanized (Hu) anti-Tac (Zenapax(Registered\n      Trademark) of patients with Tac-expressing adult T-cell leukemia; and (4) determine the\n      serum dieaway curve (pharmacokinetics) of infused humanized (Hu)-anti-Tac in patients who\n      have ATL.  This study represented an extension of Metabolism Branch National Cancer\n      Institute (NCI) protocols utilizing modifications of the original murine anti-Tac monoclonal\n      antibody (mAb) developed by our group for the treatment of ATL.  The scientific basis for\n      these therapeutic studies is that the leukemic cells of patients with ATL express abnormally\n      high levels of the Tac antigen (IL-2R alpha) on their surface whereas resting normal cells\n      including normal T-cells of the patients do not.  One presumed mode of action of Hu-anti-Tac\n      in the treatment of ATL involves the interruption of the interaction of interleukin 2 (IL-2)\n      with its growth factor receptor.  To be effective in this goal we must maintain saturation\n      of the IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) with humanized anti-Tac thereby preventing IL-2 mediated\n      proliferation and yielding cytokine deprivation and  apoptotic cell death of the leukemic\n      cells.  Eligible patients with ATL were treated with escalating doses of Zenapax(Registered\n      Trademark) between groups in the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n       Groups of patients received sufficient Zenapax(Registered Trademark) to yield saturation of\n      the IL-2 receptor for a period of 17 weeks. Clinical response was evaluated using routine\n      immunological and clinical evaluation and by monitoring the saturation of the IL-2R and the\n      absolute number of residual circulating malignant cells by fluorescence activated cell\n      sorting (FACS) analysis using two fluorochrome-labeled non-crossreacting antibodies to the\n      IL-2 receptor, anti-Tac and 7G7/B6, as well as antibodies to cluster of differentiation 3\n      (CD3), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), cluster of differentiation 7 (CD7), and cluster\n      of differentiation 8 (CD8).  Furthermore, responses were evaluated in patients with leukemia\n      by Southern blot analysis of the arrangement of the T-cell receptor genes and human\n      T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I) integration.  Finally, in select patients, to define\n      the pharmacokinetics of the therapeutic antibody, had planned to monitor the serum levels of\n      the infused Hu-anti-Tac (Zenapax(Registered Trademark)) as a function of time.  This study\n      is an essential element of our program involving IL-2R-directed therapeutic studies.  If as\n      anticipated the therapy with humanized anti-Tac yields some partial and complete remissions\n      in patients with ATL, we will propose that it be used as a single agent for patients with\n      smoldering and chronic ATL and in association with chemotherapeutic agents to provide a\n      novel approach for the treatment of acute and lymphoma forms of ATL. We also plan a future\n      clinical trial where tentative plans also had been made to evaluate the efficacy and\n      toxicity in ATL patients of saturating doses of Zenapax(Registered Trademark) as compared to\n      identical doses of Zenapax(Registered Trademark) given in association with (90)Y-armed\n      7G7/B6, a non-competing antibody to IL-2R alpha or in combination with chemotherapy."
