Determine the safety and toxicity of vaccination with MUC-1 antigen and\n      immunologic adjuvant SB AS-2 in patients with resected or locally advanced unresectable\n      pancreatic cancer. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose\n      of MUC-1 antigen in this patient population. III. Determine the qualitative and quantitative\n      tumor response to this treatment in these patients. IV. Determine the disease-free survival\n      in resected patients, progression-free survival in locally advanced unresectable patients,\n      and overall survival in all patients receiving this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of MUC-1 antigen. Patients receive vaccination with\n      MUC-1 antigen and immunologic adjuvant SB AS-2 intramuscularly on day 1. Treatment repeats\n      every 3 weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Beginning 1 year after the last vaccination, patients without recurrent disease\n      may receive booster vaccines annually. Cohorts of 4 to 8 patients receive escalating doses\n      of MUC-1 antigen until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as\n      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 4 or 2 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study."
