This can best be achieved by utilizing knowledge gained from both host-centered\n      and pathogen-centered parameters during health and disease. Unfortunately, these parameters\n      have traditionally, tended to be measured independently (for example using microbial culture\n      or PCR-based methods for microbial detection, or measurement of the immune response to\n      infections and/or blood-based biomarkers in the host), and used on an ad hoc basis without\n      careful integration for the best treatment of the patient. However, recent advances in the\n      development of high-throughput and sensitive molecular-based technologies, on-line internet\n      database access tools, and bioinformatics analysis, now means that the goal of personalized\n      medicine and treatment is in sight. Unfortunately however, there currently exists a\n      technological gap between recent state-of-the-art methodologies (for example with respect to\n      gaining new insights into novel host-pathogen interactions) and laboratory-to-bedside\n      results to benefit patients, physicians and society as a whole. The TAILORED-Treatment\n      project is designed to bridge this technological gap in order to generate novel insights and\n      innovations that are readily exploitable for the maximum benefit of multiple stakeholders in\n      the field of personalized medicine and infectious diseases."
