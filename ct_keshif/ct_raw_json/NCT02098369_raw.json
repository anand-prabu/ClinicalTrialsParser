The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a PEer-Led O2 Infoline for\n      patients and CAregivers (PELICAN) will increase adherence to supplemental oxygen\n      prescription and improve health in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n      (COPD), discharged from the hospital with a prescription for supplemental oxygen."
