  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who are overweight or do not exercise are at higher risk for breast cancer after
      menopause.  This study will test a new electronic device that measures the body's movement
      and works alongside a website to help women increase their physical activity level.  If
      effective, this system could be tested in larger studies aiming to reduce breast cancer risk
      by reducing or preventing obesity.
