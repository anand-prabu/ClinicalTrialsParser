  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meibum lipids are modified in patients with MGD, resulting in tear instability, evaporative
      dry eye, and eyelid inflammation. These changes add to corneal damages and exacerbate ocular
      symptoms, which are all associated with the constant release of inflammatory mediators. To
      our knowledge, there has been no study on tear cytokine levels in MGD patients treated with
      topical loteprednol etabonate. The investigators, thus, evaluated both inflammatory tear
      cytokine levels and corresponding clinical outcomes for analyzing the efficacy of topical
      loteprednol etabonate in moderate and severe MGD. The aim of this research was to determine
      the concentration of inflammatory tear cytokines in patients with MGD and to compare the
      changes in tear cytokine levels between topical loteprednol etabonate and warm compress
      treatment group and warm compress only treatment group.

    <description>Cytokines were measured using the BD Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA). The cytokines analyzedwere IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-1β, IL-17α, MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-12p70, and IFN-γ. Briefly, 20 μL tear fluid was thawed and added to a 50 μL mixture containing each capture antibody-bead reagent and 50 μL detector antibody-phycoerithrin (Ab-PE) reagent. The mixture was subsequently incubated for 3 h at room temperature, and washed to remove unbound detector Ab-PE reagent before flow cytometry. Data were acquired and analyzed using BD CBA software that calculates the cytokine concentration based on the standard curves and a four-parameter logistic curve-fitting model. Flow cytometry was performed using the BDTM LSRII system (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA).</description>
