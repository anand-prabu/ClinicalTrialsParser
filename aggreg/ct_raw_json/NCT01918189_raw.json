Veterans' experiences with\n      usability and satisfaction with the VPMRC will also be examined. Behavioral interventions\n      such as exercise and cognitive behavior therapy are known to be effective for low back pain\n      but are often not readily available or easily accessed. Veterans will be able to access the\n      VPMRC via their computer with an internet connection, which will increase access to this\n      type of treatment. Study participants will receive 10 weeks of access to the VPMRC, which\n      will teach them pain coping skills to manage their low back pain. The primary outcome is\n      pain-related functional interference."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of the proposed study are to: (1) develop an integrative,\n      Internet-based, veteran-centered behavioral intervention, the Veteran Pain Management\n      Resource Center (VPMRC) for chronic low back pain (CLBP), and (2) examine preliminary\n      efficacy, usability, and satisfaction of this intervention in a representative sample of\n      veterans with CLBP. The primary hypothesis states that a clinically meaningful reduction in\n      pain-related functional interference will be observed following ten weeks of exposure to the\n      VPMRC relative to baseline. The secondary hypotheses state that clinically meaningful\n      reductions in ratings of average pain intensity on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain\n      imaginable) numeric rating scale at the ten week post-baseline follow-up assessment interval\n      will be observed, in addition to statistically significant reductions in fatigue, sleep\n      problems, depressive symptoms, and negative mood at the ten week post-baseline assessment.\n      The tertiary hypotheses state that participants will report high levels of interest, site\n      usage, and satisfaction.\n\n      RESEARCH DESIGN: A non-randomized pilot study with two phases is proposed to develop and\n      evaluate an internet-based behavioral pain self-management program.  Phase I will solely\n      involve qualitative data collection. Repeated quantitative assessments during Phase II will\n      be conducted at baseline and 10-weeks post-baseline.\n\n      METHODOLOGY: A 24-month pilot study with two phases is proposed. During Phase I, the VPMRC\n      will be developed and feedback from 15 Veterans with CLBP and an Expert Panel of pain\n      management clinicians will be used to modify the program. During Phase II, a pilot\n      feasibility trial of the VPMRC with 55 veterans with CLBP will be conducted. Subjects will\n      be a total of 70 patients receiving care at the VACHS who report chronic low back pain. The\n      primary criteria for inclusion are constant pain of at least three months duration with at\n      least a moderate level of average pain (i.e., scores of 4 or greater on a 0 [no pain] to 10\n      [worst pain imaginable]) on a numerical rating scale of pain and indication of the\n      \"preparation\", \"action\", or \"maintenance\" stage of readiness to change on a brief five item\n      staging checklist. All patients must have access to a computer with an internet connection.\n      Excluded will be patients with life threatening or acute physical illness, current alcohol\n      or substance abuse or dependence, current psychosis, suicidal ideation, dementia, and\n      individuals seeking surgical pain treatment. All participants will continue to receive their\n      usual care from VHA providers. During the 10-week therapeutic window, weekly telephone calls\n      from research staff will serve to cue and monitor participants' use of the Internet program.\n      At ten weeks post-baseline, participants will be formally reassessed. Primary and secondary\n      hypotheses involving quantitative data will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat principle\n      and will employ t-tests and non-parametric analogs and regression analyses."
