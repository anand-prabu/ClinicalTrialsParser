To compare patterns of failure (local-regional relapse versus distant) and survival\n      (overall and progression-free).\n\n      II. To determine the safety and efficacy (rate of positive surgical margins) of using\n      transoral robotic surgery for patients with T3 tumors of the tonsil, tongue-base, or\n      glossopharyngeal sulcus.\n\n      III. To compare head and neck cancer-specific quality of life (QOL) short-term (< 6 months)\n      and long-term (2 years) relating to swallowing function.\n\n      IV. To compare subjective (patient reported) and objective (physiologic) measures of\n      swallowing function short-term and long-term.\n\n      V. To assess effect of neck dissection on shoulder function using a validated QOL instrument\n      for patients undergoing neck dissection VI. To assess the correlation of physician derived\n      clinical target volumes (CTV's) with locoregional control or failure.\n\n      VII. To determine whether specific molecular profiles are associated with overall or\n      progression-free survival or other clinical endpoints.\n\n      VIII. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of pre-treatment computed tomography (CT)\n      scans detecting the presence of lymph node extracapsular extension by examining the\n      surgically dissected lymph nodes.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients undergo transoral endoscopic head and neck surgery (eHNS). Depending on\n      post-operative pathology findings, patients may undergo intensity modulated radiation\n      therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) five days a week for 6 weeks.

Patients also receive\n      cisplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 during radiation therapy.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter."
