  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boys suffer a disproportionately large number of fractures compared to girls (55-60%). This
      study aims to determine why this is the case by identifying risk factors for wrist
      fractures. The increase in fracture during childhood and adolescence may be associated with
      1) risk-taking behaviour in boys, 2) obesity trends in boys during childhood and
      adolescence, and/or 3) impaired acquisition of bone strength during childhood and
      adolescence. Importantly from a knowledge translation perspective, modifiable factors such
      as behaviour, dietary habits or physical activity in boys may predict fracture.

      The investigators will measure 400 children (100 girls and 100 boys who have sustained a
      fracture; 100 same age and sex friends) across 4 years of growth. This study will assess
      risk behaviours, diet, physical activity, motor proficiency (i.e., balance and
      coordination), fat and muscle mass and bone strength to determine if there are, 1)
      differences in whether all or some of these factors predict fractures in boys compared with
      girls and, 2) whether these factors track forward similarly in boys compared with girls as
      children advance through the growth spurt.

      The investigators aim to better characterize factors that contribute to fracture in boys and
      girls and to assess whether such factors track across a four year period. The innovation is
      to use novel methods and an integrated approach, to measure the influence of risk-taking
      behaviour, body composition, bone microstructure, motor proficiency, diet and physical
      activity in one model across growth. This will provide a more comprehensive picture of the
      key multi-factorial predictors of fracture within- and between-sexes. This essential
      information will provide the basis for change in public health policy, clinical practice,
      community programs, and targeted interventions.
