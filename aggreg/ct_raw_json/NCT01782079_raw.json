Different sets\n      of primers for L. brevis detection will be tested in real-time PCR reactions to find optimal\n      amplification efficiency and target specificity. Primers ability in the identification of L.\n      brevis DNA will be assessed in a pilot study conducted on 12 healthy volunteers clinically\n      free of oral pathologies. The subjects will take 3 tablets/day for 3 days and one tablet on\n      the 4th day. Clinical samples (dorsal surface of tongue, first molar, vestibular fornix and\n      saliva) will be collected at baseline (before beginning the trial), at T0 (in the morning\n      before the assumption of the last tablet) and 3, 6, and 9 hours after taking the last\n      tablet. The quantities of L. brevis DNA will be compared to the total number of bacteria\n      present in the samples. The activity of the enzyme arginine deiminase, responsible for oral\n      pH homeostasis (particularly abundant in the CD2 strain) will be also assessed in the saliva\n      samples before and after treatment, by HPLC measurements."
