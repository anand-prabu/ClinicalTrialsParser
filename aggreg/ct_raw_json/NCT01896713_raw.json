The positive predictive value (PPV)\n      of MS3TMRI-TRUSBx for cancer requiring consideration of therapy will be compared to the PPV\n      of TRUSBx alone. MS3TMRI consists of T2, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast\n      enhanced MRI (DCEMRI), proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) interpreted by a radiologist and by CAD\n      methods validated on whole mount prostate specimens."
