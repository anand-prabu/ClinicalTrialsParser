Determine the\n      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine if the hypothesized lack of\n      social support impacts the recruitment of elderly patients into clinical trials. IV.\n      Determine if a previously validated tool of functional status in the elderly predicts\n      treatment related toxicity superior to that predicted by the ECOG performance status in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Following completion of the Lubben Social Network Scale and Frailty Questionnaire,\n      patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1,\n      8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses. Patients with complete response\n      receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients with partial response or stable disease\n      may receive additional courses of therapy at investigator's discretion. Patients are\n      followed every 3 months for 5 years or until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 49 patients will be accrued for this study over 27 months."
