However, 30-50% of patients suffer from shoulder tip pain, which might arise from\n      diaphragm stretch due to pneumoperitoneum.\n\n      In the previous pilot study, working intra-abdominal space was increased in the condition of\n      deep neuromuscular blockade. And thus investigators  hypothesized that the depth of\n      neuromuscular blockade can affect insufflation pressure and intra-abdominal volume, which\n      result in the severity of diaphragm stretch and postoperative shoulder pain. In addition,\n      the depth of neuromuscular blockade can alter pulmonary compliance."
