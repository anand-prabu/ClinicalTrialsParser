The coupling in the same\n      procedure of these 2 tests is the Botnia clamp. We also wish to use the continuous measure\n      of subcutaneous glucose during several days to estimate the reduction in the average\n      glycemia on the fast and prandial periods as well as the decrease of the time spent in\n      hyperglycemia during the day. This tool demonstrated its interest in type 2 diabetic\n      population in several studies. Finally the current / spectro-IRM methods of imaging are now\n      validated to quantify and measure exactly the importance of the steatosis, including in type\n      2 patients, because we know that it is probably the result of the insulino-resistance; We\n      would also like to demonstrate that some genetic polymorphisms of proteins (polymorphisms G\n      / T493 of the MTP, 1927 C/T of the receiver R1 of the adiponectin and 265 C/T of the gene of\n      Apolipoprot\u00e9ines A) are factors which can modulate the steatosis development in case of type\n      2 diabetes.\n\n      In other secondary criteria we wait for an improvement of HbA1c, quality of life of type 2\n      obese people with regard to the treatment by intensified Multi-injections."
