            "textblock": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, and one of the strongest\n      determinants of reduced health-related quality of life among people with diabetes.\n      Neuropathy frequently presents with painful symptoms, activity limitation, insomnia,\n      fatigue, and depressive symptoms. Anti-convulsants and tricyclic anti-depressants provide at\n      least moderate pain relief for 25-50% of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN),\n      but often decrease other domains of quality of life through adverse effects, such as dry\n      mouth, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness, and urinary problems. Effective, non-pharmaceutical\n      approaches for PDN are needed, particularly for low income and racial/ethnic minorities who\n      are at highest risk of diabetes and related complications. Acupuncture is a promising\n      treatment for PDN, but evidence is limited. To address the significant public health need\n      related to pain management among underserved people with diabetes, this study proposes an\n      innovative, group-based model of acupuncture for PDN at an urban safety net hospital.\n      Forty-eight patients who have PDN will be enrolled and randomized to one of three arms: (a)\n      usual care combined with 12 weeks of group acupuncture twice weekly, (b) usual care combined\n      with 12 weeks of group acupuncture once weekly, or (c) usual care alone (16 in each group).\n      The aims of the study are to determine the feasibility of group acupuncture for PDN among\n      underserved patients with diabetes; to evaluate the preliminary treatment effects of group\n      acupuncture on pain, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance,\n      nerve conduction velocity, and protective sensation; and to determine the optimal frequency\n      of acupuncture treatments.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that compared to patients receiving usual care alone, patients\n      who undergo weekly group acupuncture treatments will have:\n\n        1. decreased pain intensity\n\n        2. improved health-related quality of life\n\n        3. improved sural nerve conduction velocity"
