The\n      investigators will study the effects and side effects of surgery and re-irradiation. They\n      will also evaluate and study tumor tissue and blood to learn more about the tumor and how it\n      does or does not respond to treatments and will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and\n      positron emission tomography (PET) scans to see if they can predict tumor response and tumor\n      recurrence.\n\n      Participants will be followed for up to 5 years following enrollment.  Evaluations during\n      radiation therapy will be done weekly while receiving therapy for up to 7 weeks.  Other\n      evaluations will be done at enrollment, every 4 months from enrollment through 3 years, and\n      every 6 months during the 4th and 5th year."

Descriptively compare findings for patients treated with an initial course of\n           irradiation.\n\n        -  To conduct a variety of exploratory molecular analyses on tumor samples (and blood\n           where a germline control is required), including but not limited to broad (genome-wide\n           / array-based) or focused (gene-specific) analyses at the DNA, RNA, or protein level\n           and next generation (whole genome, exome, transcriptome) sequencing in an effort to\n           improve the investigators understanding of ependymoma biology, and to explore\n           associations between molecular findings and treatment response and various side effects\n           including vasculopathy, hearing loss, cognitive deficits, and growth hormone deficiency\n           and other measures as appropriate.\n\n        -  To explore the association of chemotherapy given prior to re-irradiation with PFS and\n           OS distributions"
