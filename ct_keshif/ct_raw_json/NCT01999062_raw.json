However, these on-line automation tools require further\n      technical refinement and clinical validation. The goal of this research proposal is to\n      develop an on-line MR-guided radiation therapy process for adapting breast IMRT treatment.\n      Such an approach will provide early stage breast cancer patients timely access to\n      high-quality adaptive treatments without exposure to additional ionizing radiation."
