  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GLYX-13 is a NMDA receptor glycine site partial agonist being studied in subjects with major
      depressive disorder (depression) who have responded inadequately to another antidepressant
      drug during the current episode.  This trial will assess the effects of GLYX-13 on
      depression when added to another antidepressant drug that the patient is already taking.
