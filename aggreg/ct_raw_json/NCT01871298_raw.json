We will target high drug activity neighborhoods in New York City and enroll\n      participants recruited through targeted street outreach. All participants (n=336) will\n      undergo an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) that will assess\n      socio-demographics, health care access and utilization, sex/drug use behavior, health\n      status, and characteristics of general and health-related internet/mobile technology use\n      including factors that promote or hinder use. Participants identified as using the internet\n      \u22651/month (n=151) will return for a 4-week ACASI to report on use of the pilot website (which\n      will largely display information currently available in the community in print/ pamphlet/\n      video form)."
