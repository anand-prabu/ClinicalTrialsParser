Therefore we measure the activity of\n      Acetylcholine-Esterase and Butyrylcholine-Esterase in whole blood of adults in the\n      perioperative context. Early postoperative delirium will be detected by Nu-DESC in the\n      Recovery Room or the Postanaesthesia-Care-Unit. The course of the peripheral cholinesterase\n      activity will be compared with the incidence of postoperative delirium and other clinical\n      dysfunctions.\n\n      We follow up the patients for up to five years regarding Delirum, comorbidities and\n      mortality data."
