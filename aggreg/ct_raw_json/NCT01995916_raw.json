Both of these interventions will be run in a group format, meaning that you\n      will be part of a group of other women who have a menstrual mood disorder.   Both of these\n      interventions will be run by experienced mental health professionals and both interventions\n      have been shown to be effective in reducing mood symptoms, increasing a sense of well-being,\n      and helping individuals cope with stress.  While it is expected that both interventions to\n      be associated with some benefit, this study is designed to see which is better for women\n      with a menstrual mood disorder."
