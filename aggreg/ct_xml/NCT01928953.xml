  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to calculate the rate of inadequate response to laxatives
      in a cohort of patients with OIC, as well as to gain a detailed understanding of the burden
      of illness of OIC by documenting the characteristics of patients seeking usual care in the
      laxative-inadequate responders (LIR) and the laxative-adequate responders (LAR) opioid user
      subgroups. The study will do so by evaluating the burden of illness impact of OIC on each of
      the opioid user patient sub-groups of interest in terms of clinical outcomes (including
      symptoms), resource utilization (laxative use, OIC-related MD visits, hospitalizations, and
      ER visits), economic burden, and HRQL. This study also aims to identify &quot;predictors&quot; of
      outcomes of interest and will evaluate physician and patient perceptions of the severity and
      burden of OIC.
