The hallmark\n      feature of adipose tissue inflammation is the crown-like structure, a dying fat cell\n      surrounded by immune cells attempting to clear the damage. Current methods for detecting\n      adipose tissue inflammation rely on invasive procedures such as fat biopsies. We propose\n      developing methods that use the light reflection properties of inflamed adipose tissue as a\n      potential non-invasive method to detect adipose tissue inflammation."
