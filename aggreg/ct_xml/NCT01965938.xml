  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized trial comparing the success rate and time to intubation using
      the RIFL vs. the fiberoptic bronchoscope, as the latter is commonly held to be the gold
      standard of difficult airway devices.  Specifically, we wish to compare the of intubation
      between the two devices in patients with potentially difficult airways as defined by an
      oropharyngeal class 3-4, BMI greater than 35, or in patients with a history of difficult
      intubation using direct laryngoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who require general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation will be identified the
      night prior to their surgery based upon the examination documented in their preoperative
      history and physical.  If their body mass index achieves a calculated score of 35 or greater
      or they have an oropharyngeal class 4 airway then they will qualify to participate.

      After written informed consent is obtained, The intubation method would be randomized as one
      of two groups: intubation via use of the fiberoptic bronchoscope or the RIFL. The intubation
      attempt will be terminated if the SpO2 &lt;90, HR&lt;50, there is traumatic injury, or time &gt;
      100sec.  If terminated, the patient will be mask ventilated and the attending
      anesthesiologist would determine the subsequent technique that will be used for airway
      management.
