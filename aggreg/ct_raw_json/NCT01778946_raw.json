            "textblock": "Over 50% of adults with Down Syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the age of 60\n      (Nadel 2003), and life expectancy in DS is now 50-60 years. Thus, age-associated cognitive\n      impairment and dementia in older adults with DS is an urgent public health concern. The\n      investigators propose that nicotinic stimulation is a promising strategy to stabilize or\n      improve cognitive functioning in adults with DS, possibly with additional neuroprotective\n      effects. The investigators have extensive experience investigating the role of nicotinic\n      receptors on human cognition and impairment. This application takes advantage of new\n      insights into treating Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI-the precursor condition to Alzheimer's\n      Disease (AD) in typically developing individuals) with nicotine to propose an open label\n      pilot study of transdermal nicotine in middle-aged non-smoking DS patients who show early\n      cognitive and/or behavioral changes consistent with MCI/dementia.\n\n      The goal of this study is to establish preliminary evidence for safety, gain preliminary\n      evidence as to whether nicotine enhances cognitive functioning in DS adults, and examine\n      electrophysiological, biological, and behavioral correlates of nicotinic stimulation\n      effects.\n\n      The investigators propose that positive results on cognitive or functional indices that\n      would lead to a larger and longer double-blind trial to test more definitively whether\n      nicotinic stimulation may be cognitively and/or functionally enhancing for DS patients. The\n      knowledge gained from the translational aspects of this project will guide the development\n      of potentially new nicotinic drugs in DS and generate, for the first time, data on the\n      importance of nicotinic receptor changes in the development of cognitive impairment in DS\n      adults. This work also represents the first time that cutting-edge advances in treating\n      MCI/AD in the general population are immediately and rigorously applied to those with DS."
