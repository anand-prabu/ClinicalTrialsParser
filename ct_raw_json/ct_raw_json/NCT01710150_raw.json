Studies have demonstrated the\n      safety and superiority of ablation procedure over antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy.  Long\n      term freedom from typical AFLT has been consistently shown after successful ablation, but up\n      to 30% of these patients can experience new onset of a different arrhythmia i.e., Atrial\n      Fibrillation (AF).  AF results from triggers in the back of the left upper chamber in the\n      heart (left atrium - LA). These triggers typically arise from in and around the opening of\n      the 4 veins (pulmonary veins - PVs) that bring blood from the lungs into the heart. The\n      highest incidence of AF in patients undergoing ablation for typical AFLT was observed where\n      the follow-up duration exceeded a year after the AFLT ablation. This would suggest that AF\n      development in patients undergoing typical AFLT ablation is progressive and inevitable."
