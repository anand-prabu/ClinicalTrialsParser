History of CNS\n             metastasis or stable CNS metastases are allowed (no longer requiring active therapy\n             such as steroid medications).  Participants with a history of CNS metastases must\n             have a brain scan (for example, magnetic resonance imaging) within 28 days of\n             randomization to document stability, even if there have been no changes in symptoms."
