            "textblock": "Total knee arthroplasty(TKA) is mostly performed with tourniquet applied, because it allows\n      decreased intraoperative blood loss, better visualization of surgical field and better\n      cement fixation of the implants, compared to the TKA without using tourniquet. However,\n      there remains a controversy about the timing of tourniquet release, so the tourniquet may be\n      unreleased throughout the whole operation time or released early just after cement fixation\n      of the implants, atc. Early tourniquet release is generally aimed to control hidden arterial\n      bleeding which would not be revealed if the tourniquet was unreleased. This method was\n      reported to reduce arterial bleeding and its related complications, but it was also known\n      that increase intraoperative bleeding, incidence of transfusion, and operation time. On the\n      other hand, late tourniquet release, which the tourniquet is unreleased until the wound is\n      closed, is reported to increase tourniquet-use time and related complications owing to\n      longer tourniquet time, although it gives shorter operation time. The investigators have\n      been used a way of reinflation of tourniquet after early release, once the arterial bleeding\n      was controlled sufficiently, to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the early\n      tourniquet release. The investigators were able to control arterial bleeding during the time\n      the tourniquet was released, and the remained procedures were performed conveniently with\n      good visualization of the surgical field after the tourniquet was reinflated again. However,\n      there was no previous studies about the efficacy and the safety of the way of reinflation\n      after early release of the tourniquet in the literature. Therefore, the investigators ask in\n      this study whether the reinflation after early tourniquet release has advantages over the\n      method of early tourniquet release without reinflation, in terms of efficacy and safety."
