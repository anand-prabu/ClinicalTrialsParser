MBB helps participants use their senses to listen to sounds, and experience visual or tactile input, to calm their minds and relax their bodies. Written 'mapping' exercises enable them to recognize and defuse requirements, which are expectations of how they or the world should be. For the MBB anger management program, participants will be provided with a variety of mapping exercises to identify the source of their anger, and how they can effectively control it."
