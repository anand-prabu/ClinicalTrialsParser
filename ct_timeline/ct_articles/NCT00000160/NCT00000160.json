However, only a few studies of photocoagulation incorporated any of the basic principles of controlled clinical trials, and these involved inadequate numbers of patients. \u00a0Consequently, there has been inadequate evidence of the actual value of the procedure. Because of the clinical importance of diabetic retinopathy and the increasing use of photocoagulation in its management, the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) was begun in 1971. \u00a0This randomized, controlled clinical trial involved more than 1,700 patients enrolled at 15 medical centers.<br/><br/> One eye of each patient was randomly assigned to immediate photocoagulation and the other to followup without treatment, regardless of the course followed by either eye. \u00a0The eye chosen for photocoagulation was randomly assigned to either of two treatment techniques, one using an argon laser and the other a xenon arc photocoagulator. \u00a0Patients were followed at 4-month intervals according to a protocol that provided for measurement of best corrected visual acuity.<br/><br/>Treatment was usually completed in one or two sittings and included scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation extending to or beyond the vortex vein ampulae. \u00a0The argon treatment technique specified 800 to 1,600, 500-micron scatter burns of 0.1 second duration and direct treatment of new vessels whether on or within one disc diameter of the optic disc (NVD) or outside this area (NVE). \u00a0Focal treatment was also applied to microaneurysms or other lesions thought to be causing macular edema. \u00a0Followup treatment was applied as needed at 4-month intervals. \u00a0The xenon technique was similar, but scatter burns were fewer in number, generally of longer duration, and stronger, and direct treatment was applied only to NVE on the surface of the retina.</p></td></tr><tr><th>Phase</th><td>Phase 3</td></tr><tr><th>Study type</th><td>Interventional</td></tr><tr><th>Study design</th><td>Treatment</td></tr><tr><th>Study design</th><td>Randomized</td></tr><tr><th>Condition</th><td>         Diabetic Retinopathy      </td></tr><tr><th>Condition</th><td>         Blindness      </td></tr><tr><th>Intervention</th><td><div>Procedure<ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\">/Surgery</ins><span>: Xenon Photocoagulation</span></div><ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\"><p></p></ins><span></span></td></tr><tr><th>Intervention</th><td><div>Procedure<ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\">/Surgery</ins><span>: Argon Photocoagulation</span></div><ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\"><p></p></ins><span></span></td></tr><tr><th>Intervention</th><td><div>Procedure<ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\">/Surgery</ins><span>: Photocoagulation</span></div><ins style=\"background:#e6ffe6;\"><p></p></ins><span></span></td></tr><tr><th>Reference</th><td><div>Citation: The Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group; A modification of the Airlie House classification of diabetic retinopathy.
