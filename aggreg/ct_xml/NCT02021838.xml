      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the Office on Violence Against Women's (OVW)
      Domestic Violence  Homicide Prevention Demonstration Initiative.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Phase I, 12 sites assessed their structures and processes for addressing domestic
      violence.  In Phase II, up to six sites will implement their work plans to test changes to
      existing procedures, practices, and structures related to domestic violence homicide
      prevention.  This evaluation will assess the processes and outcomes within and across sites.

      Subjects:

      As this is an evaluation of models carried out by Phase II sites, the &quot;subjects&quot; are the six
      funded sites. Research Design and Methods:  The national evaluation will be a
      utilization-focused developmental evaluation-&quot;utilization-focused&quot; in that the project will
      be done for and with primary intended users of the evaluation findings; &quot;developmental&quot; in
      that the intended use is development of domestic violence homicide prevention models.
      Process evaluation will focus on the internal dynamics and actual operations of domestic
      violence homicide prevention programs at Phase II sites.  This will be achieved primarily
      through the use of system dynamics modeling, which uses computer simulation to understand
      the behavior of complex systems over time.  Outcome evaluation will examine the intended and
      unintended consequences of the prevention programs.  This will be carried out largely
      through the use of multilevel modeling, which takes into account multiple sources of
      variation when estimating differences in outcomes between sites.

      Analysis:

      System dynamics modeling within and across sites will progress through a series of iterative
      steps involving problem articulation, formulation of a dynamic hypothesis, development of a
      computer simulation model, validation and model testing, and policy design and
      recommendations.  Multilevel modeling will take into account individual- (victims and
      perpetrators), intimate partner relationship-, and site-level variables in estimation of
      between site variation in outcomes.  Cost-effectiveness analyses will include an assessment
      of the cost-effectiveness of the overall initiative, as well as sub-analyses comparing
      cost-effectiveness of individual sites whose prevention programs proved effective.

      Products, Reports, and Data Archiving:

      The investigators will produce a final report providing a comprehensive overview of the
      national evaluation and its findings.  The investigators will also provide quarterly
      financial reports as well as semi-annual progress reports. The final project submission will
      also include data files with original and transformed data variables; statistical analysis
      software syntax that documents the analysis process; files that document the system dynamics
      models; and a data and research guidebook as specified in the archiving plan.

        The sites will vary by demographic composition (e.g., race, class, gender,
        rural-urban-suburban geography, family and community violence rates, resources, political
        and social systems). We will need to measure the population of subjects involved in the
        program being evaluated and to determine for whom the program is appropriate. A more
        specific definition for operationalization of DV homicide, potential perpetrators and
        victims will be required to make this assessment.
