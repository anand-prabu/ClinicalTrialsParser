            "textblock": "Objective:  To ascertain whether homoeopathic medicine ABROMA AUGUSTA has a clinical role in\n      changing the Glycated Hb Level in Diabetes mellitus Type II.\n\n      Introduction:\n\n      Diabetes mellitus is classed as a metabolism disorder. It is often simply referred to as\n      diabetes\u2014is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either\n      because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the\n      insulin that is produced.\n\n      Blood sugar level is not only the criteria to diagnose the Dabeties Mellitus ,  Glycated\n      hemoglobin (glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, A1C, or Hb1; sometimes also\n      HbA1c) is a form of hemoglobin used primarily to identify the average  plasma glucose\n      concentration over prolonged periods of time.\n\n      Diabetes is the single most important metabolic disease which can affect nearly every organ\n      system in the body. According to the World Health Organization estimates, India had 32\n      million diabetic subjects in the year 2000 and this number would increase to 80 million by\n      the year 2030 (1). The 2010 American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in\n      Diabetes added the A1c \u2265 6.5% as another criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes.It is\n      noticed that the blood sugar(HbA1c) is not controlled by other system of medicine, the\n      patients come for Homoeopathic treatment and afc.ter homoeopathic treatment, it is seen that\n      there is a remarkable improvements on HbA1c along with the general improvement of health\n      like tiredness, lethargy numbness, polyurea, polydypsia and polyphagia et. But there is no\n      scientific validation for that. So this study is conducted for achieving the optimal\n      ugglycosuria, homoeopathic hypoglycemics is investigated."

            "textblock": "According to recent survey reports about 5% of the total world population is suffering from\n      Diabetes Mellitus. The incidence rate is also reasonably high in India. Currently about 20%\n      of Indian Population is at High risk to develop Diabetes Mellitus in future i.e. they are\n      having abnormal glucose Tolerance test. Studies have revealed that diabetic women suffer\n      more than men. A male who is diabetic has double the chances of a heart failure. In case of\n      women it grows to almost 5 times and it is 8 times more if the patient is a young female.\n\n      Homeopathic treatment: When we talk about diseases like diabetes, we talk in terms of\n      management rather than cure. Homoeopathy can be a major player in the management of\n      Diabetes. Timely-administered homoeopathy medicines not only assist in maintaining levels of\n      sugar, protein and fat metabolism, but also helps in preventing further progress and hence\n      complications of the disease. The precipitating factors of diabetes like BP, Obesity etc.\n      can be helped by homoeopathic medication. The complications of Diabetes also can be helped\n      tremendously with homoeopathy. If homoeopathic treatment is opted earlier far less number of\n      cases would go to the stage of Amputation etc. Even the cases of Non Healing Diabetic Ulcers\n      have been cured with homoeopathy in Clinic. We have been able to help the patients of long\n      standing Diabetes to whom their Anti-diabetic medicines stopped affecting anymore and needed\n      the change in group of medication with persistent symptoms and threatening complications,\n      after the proper Constitutional Homoeopathic medicines, the same medicines started affecting\n      them once again with no persistence of symptoms and over all relief and comfort in their\n      quality of life. Homoeopathy does help the person in regaining his health.There are\n      different groups of medicines. As homoeopathic treatment is a holistic approach so it varies\n      according to the individuals. Diabetic remedies can be - Acet-Ac, Adren, Arg-M, Arg-N, Ars,\n      Ars-I,  Aur,  Aur-M,  Bar-C,  Bov, Calc, Calc-P, Carc,  Chel,  Chim, Chin,  Fl-Ac, Helon,\n      Hep,  Iod,   Kali-P,  Lach,  Lyc,  Med,  Nat-M,  Nat-P,Nat-S, Nit-Ac,  Nux-V, Op,  Petr,\n      Ph-Ac,  Phos, Plb, Sep, Sil, Sulph, Sul-Ac, Syzyg,  Tarent, Ter,  Thuj, 3 Uran-N,\n\n      Specifics: Abroma Augusta, Cephalandra indica, Syzygium jambolanum, Gymnama\n      sylvestre,Chimaphilla.\n\n      Above all the medicines are having very good result in controlling blood glucose levels.\n      When they have very good therapeutic value so we would like to investigate the effect on\n      HbA1c. this is a pilot study.\n\n      Abroma augusta (Olat Kambal, Devil's Cotton).The plant of Abroma augusta grows wild\n      throughout the hotter part of India. In ancient times, it was used therapeutically as an\n      emmenagogue in menstrual disorders. Late Dr. D.N.Roy of Calcutta proved this drug. A\n      tincture of the drug is prepared from its leaves according to class III of American\n      Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. It is used in diabetes insipidus with very gratifying results.\n      Clinically it is indicated in Diabetes, albuminuria, enuresis, debility, vertigo,\n      sleeplessness, carbuncle, amenorrhoea and dysmenorrhoea. In brief, it has its action on all\n      the systems of human body, which are similar to Camphor, Acid-phos, Uranium nitricum,\n      Syzygium and Lactic acid but it is an excellent remedy for amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea and\n      diabetes. It is indicated in irregular catamenia where there is tendency to appear before\n      proper time and lasts for a short or for a long period.\n\n      Several cases of Diabetes Mellitus even with complications - diabetic foot treated with\n      homoeopathic medicines and seen very good results clinically.\n\n      Potency used - mother tincure, 6c, 12c, 30 etc in frequent interval.\n\n      Materials and methods:\n\n      Research plan:\n\n      Sampling Details: Patients attending the OPD of Fr Muller Homoeopathic Medical College\n      Hospital, St Antonyn's Hospital, Prasanth Nivas Hospital, and NMPT's Mobile centre will be\n      taken up for study. This study will be done on 30 diagnosed cases with high HbA1c level. But\n      approximately 40-50 patients will be screened to ensure enrollment of 30 patients in trial.\n\n      Inclusion Criteria     Exclusion Criteria Age 30 Years above  Patient with major\n      complications like diabetic retinopathy and cardiomyopathy.\n\n      Both Sexes NIDDM IDDM FBS - 110-300mg/dl HbA1c above \u2264 6.5   HbA1c above 11%\n\n      Research protocol:\n\n      Sampling: purposive sampling will be followed in this study. Patients who belong to the\n      above category of inclusions criteria will be taken up and those will be willing to take\n      homoeopathic medicines for T2DM.\n\n      Screening:  the patients having the Random Blood Suger (RBS) - 150mg/dl above will be\n      sending for the following tests listed below:\n\n      Fasting (FBS) - above 111mg/dl Post Prandial blood Suger (PPBS) -150mg/dl above. HbA1c% -\n      above 6.5 Those will fulfill the above criteria, will be included in this study. Cases will\n      be recorded in a prescribed format which is given in Anexure 4 along with patients consent\n      form and patient's information sheet.\n\n      Medicines: Abroma Augusta Q (Mother tincture form) Dose: 30 drops TDS Visits:   Follow up -\n      every 15 days FBS & PPBS - Monthly HbA1c% - end of 3 months Each patient will be treated\n      minimum 3 months with Abroma Augusta \u019f and FBS, and PPBS will be checked in every month and\n      HbA1c once in 3 months as the life span of RBC is 120 days.\n\n      .Research Methodology & statistics:\n\n      Criteria for deciding the efficacy of Homoeopathic drugs will be based on parameters follow:\n\n        1. . Change FBS, and PPBS\n\n        2. Change in HbA1c level\n\n      Statistical analysis:\n\n      Data from the sample will be collected and it will be analysed based on Paired't' test to\n      determine the efficacy of homoeopathic medicines.\n\n      Null Hypothesis: No Significant variation in HbA1c before and after treatment. Alternate\n      Hypothesis:  Significant Variation in HbA1c before and after treatment.\n\n      Tabulation will be done based on SPS package."
