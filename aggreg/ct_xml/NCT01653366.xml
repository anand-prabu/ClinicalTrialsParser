  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized prospective clinical trial of women with metastatic breast
      cancer.  The purpose of the study is to test if an intervention of regular physical activity
      review and physical activity goal setting will allow the subjects to achieve a moderate
      increase in physical activity of 6,000 steps per week.  The physical activity review will
      consist of weekly telephone call to inquire about symptoms and to set physical activity
      goals.  The study will also look to see if the goal setting intervention will affect the
      time to progression, change in BMI, and quality of life.  Quality of life will be measured
      by answers to questionnaires provided to subjects at regular intervals during the course of
      the study.  Finally, the study will examine the impact of physical activity on circulating
      tumor cells, expression of tumor molecular molecules, insulin levels, and estradiol levels.

      Through an intervention of regular physical activity review and goal setting, the
      investigators hypothesize that a moderate increase in level of physical activity of 6000
      steps per week or more can be obtained by patients with metastatic breast cancer who receive
      a goal setting intervention.  The investigators propose that those who are able to achieve
      and maintain greater than or equal to 22500 steps per week will demonstrate biologic and
      molecular differences compared to those who are not able to achieve that level of physical
      activity.  The investigators expect that people who are more active will have longer to
      progression.
