            "textblock": "Epilepsy and epileptiform EEG abnormalities are common co-morbidities in Autism Spectrum\n      Disorders (ASD) that can be considered important biomarkers of cortical dysfunction in these\n      disorders.  They may represent a measure of the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance posited to\n      be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder.  Treatment of epilepsy is always indicated,\n      but treatment of isolated epileptiform EEG (i.e. in the absence of clinical seizures) is\n      frankly controversial.  Since data suggest that these epileptiform discharges are associated\n      with deficits in attention, language and behavior, the investigators believe that they may\n      represent an important and novel treatment target in this population.  The proposed study\n      brings together a group of investigators long interested in this problem in order to\n      investigate the efficacy of using an anticonvulsant medication with spike suppression\n      capabilities (VPA in the form of divalproex sodium) to treat children with ASD and isolated\n      epileptiform EEGs.  Recruiting from 3 large autism centers (Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)\n      and Vanderbilt University (VU) and University of Louisville (U of L)) with very large\n      pediatric epilepsy units, the investigators propose a 26 week randomized placebo controlled\n      cross over study of VPA in 4-8 year old children with ASD with frequent epileptiform EEG\n      discharges."
