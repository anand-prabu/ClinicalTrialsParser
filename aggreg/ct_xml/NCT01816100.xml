  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a unique blend of new technologies never used in combination with individuals
      diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS).  The results of this research will define changes in
      brain activity, functional brain activation and diffusion in the brain following 6 months of
      structured weight resistance and balance training.   Positive changes would indicate that
      the therapy has ignited brain plasticity and may drive the brain to repair itself.  These
      changes to the brain may affect recovery as a result of neuroplasticity, neuroprotection,
      and slowing of neural degeneration.  No other trials have been published evaluating brain
      plasticity utilizing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in
      subjects with MS undergoing physical training.  DTI has demonstrated the ability to find
      changes (plasticity) that occur in the brain and using the MEG findings to focus the DTI
      analysis will optimize the capacity to detect changes secondary to therapy.  This
      quantification will give a better understanding of the repair that goes on in the brain, and
      may potentially revolutionize the field of the central nervous system (CNS) rehabilitation.
      One of the most innovative aspects of this study is the full integration of clinical
      neurobehavioral metrics and functional imaging data in conjunction with a proven MS therapy
      along with quality of life indicators.  This approach will allow new links to be illuminated
      as the trajectories of functional and structural brain changes (neuroplasticity) are meshed
      with clinical improvement indices collected visit-by-visit.  This study will also compare
      disease modifying treatments (DMTs) and their effect(s) on indices of brain plasticity and
      cognitive and behavioral assessments.

      Rationale MEG is a direct measure of ongoing neurophysiological activity and is appropriate
      because of spatiotemporal resolution of measurements and immunity of the technique to
      vascular biases that contaminate functional MRI imaging of MS patients.4 MEG will help to
      illuminate the brain bases of motor deficits that exist relative to healthy controls and
      show how the improvements observed behaviorally are reflected in the brain activity that
      underlies those improvements.  Since DTI has demonstrated the ability to find changes
      (plasticity) that occur in the brain in patients, it is very promising that DTI will be able
      to detect evidence of neuroplasticity in our research population.5  Using the MEG findings
      to sharpen the DTI analysis, a very powerful combination, will optimize the ability to
      detect and understand changes.

      Objectives Specific Aim 1 - Determine if there are activation differences (see below) in the
      neural regions serving motor function during basic movements using MEG in a group of MS
      patients, comparing MS affected portions of the brain versus non-affected.

      Specific Aim 2 - Determine the effect of a specific 6 month resistance and balance exercise
      program on activation in sensorimotor brain areas using MEG, and correlate changes in these
      neural indices with those of specific movement and balance.

      Specific Aim 3 - Determine the effect of a specific 6 month resistance and balance exercise
      program on brain diffusivity and fractional anisotropy using DTI and correlate changes in
      these metrics with improvement in strength and balance measures in subjects with MS,
      comparing MS affected portions of the brain versus non-affected areas..

      Specific Aim 4 - Determine whether increased fiber integrity (fractional anisotropy) along
      the corticospinal tract is reflected in MEG activation metrics of the primary motor cortex
      from baseline to 6 months in subjects with MS enrolled in the three-month resistance and
      balance exercise program.
