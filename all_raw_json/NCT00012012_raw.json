Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays\n      to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor\n      cells. Drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation\n      therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cisplatin and radiation\n      therapy with or without amifostine in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IVA\n      cancer of the cervix."

Patients also undergo either intracavitary low-dose\n           rate (LDR) brachytherapy in 2 applications beginning within 2 weeks after completion of\n           external beam radiotherapy at 2-3 week intervals or 6 fractions of high-dose rate\n           intracavitary brachytherapy over 8 weeks beginning as early as week 2 of external beam\n           radiotherapy. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour weekly for 6 weeks\n           concurrently with external beam radiotherapy and once with LDR brachytherapy. Phase II\n           proceeds only if toxicity in phase I is within expected parameters.\n\n        -  Phase II: Patients receive external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and cisplatin as\n           in phase I. Patients also receive amifostine subcutaneously daily just before external\n           beam radiotherapy and cisplatin. Treatment continues for up to 8 weeks in the absence\n           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-66 patients (27 for phase I and 13-39 for phase II) will be\n      accrued for this study within 12-30 months."
