A medicine called G-CSF (filgrastim) stimulates bone\n      marrow and daily filgrastim shots are commonly used to shorten neutropenic periods and\n      decrease infections after chemotherapy. Since filgrastim is customarily used on a fixed\n      schedule starting early after chemotherapy and there are data that early doses may not be\n      needed, this study tests new flexible schedule of filgrastim to optimize its use by reducing\n      the number of painful shots, cost of treatment, and filgrastim side effects in children with\n      cancer receiving chemotherapy."

After completion of the\n      second filgrastim treatment, chemotherapy treatment may continue for up to 5 (OPEC) or 6\n      (ICE, ICT) courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."
