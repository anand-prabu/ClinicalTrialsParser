The investigators intend to demonstrate\n      the efficacy of oral administration of 200 mg mifepristone and sublingual administration of\n      600 \u00b5g misoprostol with gestations through 70 days, as well as the acceptability of this\n      method. Research questions include:\n\n        1. What is the efficacy of regimen of 200 mg mifepristone, followed 24 to 48 hours later\n           by 600 \u00b5g sublingual misoprostol and used in gestations of up to 70 days?\n\n        2. Is medical abortion procedure consisting of two visits acceptable to women in\n           Kazakhstan?\n\n        3. Are the side effects associated with sublingual use of misoprostol acceptable to women?\n\n        4. When given a choice, do women prefer to take mifepristone in the clinic or at a place\n           of their choosing?"
