  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimetazidine is a metabolic agent without any negative inotropic or vasodilatory
      properties. In addition, previous reports showed that trimetazidine was effective in
      reducing intracoronary platelet aggregation and preventing platelet thrombogenesis.
      Therefore, for the evaluation of these combination effects of statin and trimetazidine on
      patients with aspirin monotherapy who had previously received CABG and were free of the
      major adverse cardiac events such as death, MI, TLR, or TVR for 12 months, the investigators
      hypothesize that atorvastatin 40mg/day would be more effective in the prevention of the
      further late adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events than other statin. To test this
      hypothesis, the investigators will perform a multi-center, randomized, prospective trial
      aimed at demonstrating the superiority of combination of high dose atorvastatin therapy and
      trimetazidine to pravastatin in patients with aspirin monotherapy 12 months after CABG
      surgery in real world practice.
