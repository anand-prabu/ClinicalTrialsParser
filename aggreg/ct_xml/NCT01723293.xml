  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the behavior of the fetal heart rate in response to
      different intensities of acute maternal exercise in training and non-training pregnant women

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fetal heart rate is considered an important index of fetal well-being, especially during the
      third trimester of pregnancy (Rodney JR, Huntley BJ, Rodney WM, 2012). An increase in the
      FHR of 5-25 beats per min (bpm) in response to maternal exercise has been established as a
      normal reaction(Riemann,Kanstrup Hansen, 2000)however the normal FHR response to maternal
      exercise has remained unclear for several reasons

      Most of the studies are focused on obtain data in order to examine the fetal heart rate
      response to maternal exercise using cardiotocography measurements prior to and following
      maternal exercise

    <description>The physical conditioning program included a total of three 55-60 minute sessions per week. Pregnant women started in 9-12 weeks and finished in 38-40 weeks, therefore, an average of 85 training sessions were planned for each participant. All subjects wore a heart rate (HR) monitor (Polar FT7, Finland) during the training sessions to ensure that the exercise intensity was light to moderate.
Each session included a 25-minutes of aerobic exercise, 10-minutes of strength exercise and balance exercise as well, and 10-minutes of pelvic floor muscles training.</description>
