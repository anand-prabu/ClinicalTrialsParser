      Veterans with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses (SMI) are at elevated risk
      for co-occurring chronic medical conditions resulting in increased risk of disability, high
      health care spending, reduced quality of life and early mortality. Physical wellness is
      increasingly recognized as a key component of the VA's commitment to developing
      recovery-oriented and veteran-centered mental health treatment. There is also growing
      recognition of the value of interventions that promote and improve patient self-management
      of chronic medical conditions. Building on the established efficacy of consumer facilitated
      medical illness self-management programming used in the general population and two recent
      adaptations for use with SMI adults in the public health sector (including our own
      evaluation of an intervention called Living Well), we propose to complete a randomized
      controlled effectiveness trial of our Living Well intervention and simultaneously conduct a
      well specified process evaluation to optimize knowledge accrual regarding important factors
      that may improve future adoption, implementation and sustainability of the Living Well
      intervention in the VA system of care.

      Background:

      Veterans with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses (SMI) are at elevated risk
      for co-occurring chronic medical conditions resulting in increased risk of disability, high
      health care spending, reduced quality of life and early mortality. Physical wellness is
      increasingly recognized as a key component of the VA's commitment to developing
      recovery-oriented and veteran-centered mental health treatment. There is also growing
      recognition of the value of interventions that promote and improve patient self-management
      of chronic medical conditions. Building on the established efficacy of consumer facilitated
      medical illness self-management programming used in the general population and two recent
      adaptations for use with SMI adults in the public health sector (including our own
      evaluation of an intervention called Living Well), we propose to complete a randomized
      controlled effectiveness trial of our Living Well intervention and simultaneously conduct a
      well specified process evaluation to optimize knowledge accrual regarding important factors
      that may improve future adoption, implementation and sustainability of the Living Well
      intervention in the VA system of care.

      Aims:

      Primary AIM 1:  Complete a randomized controlled effectiveness trial of our Living Well
      intervention with 234 veterans with SMI and at least one co-occurring chronic medical
      condition and evaluate the intervention's effects on functional and service related
      outcomes. We hypothesize that those randomized to the Living Well intervention will, in
      comparison to those randomized to a medical illness education and support group, demonstrate
      improved general health functioning including physical and emotional functioning as well as
      reduced rates of medical emergency room visits for management of a chronic medical
      condition. We will also evaluate intervention effects on more proximal attitudinal and
      behavioral outcomes and assess how these factors mediate improvement in the functional and
      services related outcomes.

      Primary AIM 2:  Complete a well specified process evaluation based on the RE-AIM evaluation
      framework to better understand contextual factors that can improve the Reach, Effectiveness,
      Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance which together determine the potential public
      health impact of the Living Well intervention.

      Methods:

      A mix of temporally overlapping quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to
      maximize integration and synthesis of data streams across the two aims to optimize knowledge
      accrual.

      Impact:

      Despite the growing recognition that self-management strategies hold enormous promise for
      improving quality and outcomes of care for chronic medical illnesses, and the fact that
      self-management is gaining prominence as a mental health recovery oriented treatment focus,
      there are currently no evidence-based peer facilitated medical illness self-management
      interventions available for dissemination within the VA mental health system.  Our proposed
      study is designed to both generate evidence supporting the effectiveness of a peer
      co-facilitated intervention and to help speed throughput to public health impact by
      collecting important contextual information about factors that may improve future
      dissemination and implementation efforts.

    <description>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) is a comprehensive neuropsychological screening battery that assesses memory, language, visuo-spatial/constructional ability, and attention.  The RBANS has been shown to perform well as a clinical screening test and as an outcome measure for clinical trials in schizophrenia.  As cognitive functioning may relate to study outcomes, RBANS scores will be used in exploratory analyses focusing on the relationship between various cognitive skills and related study outcomes.  We will be using an abbreviated version.</description>
