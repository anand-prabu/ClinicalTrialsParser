Clopidogrel is the most widely used P2Y12\n      inhibitor despite it's limitations that include highly variable P2Y12-receptor inhibition\n      which causes wide interindividual platelet reactivity variability. Since high on-treatment\n      platelet reactivity (HTPR) on clopidogrel is strongly associated with adverse events,\n      antiplatelet therapy tailoring has been vastly investigated to determine whether\n      individualized approach could improve outcomes. In the time of progressive personalized\n      approach to therapy, effective strategies are needed to minimize the risk of ischemic\n      adverse events without increasing the risk for bleeding.\n\n      Aim of this study is to investigate whether continuous clopidogrel dose adjustment according\n      to platelet function testing (PFT) using Multiplate\u00ae function analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,\n      Mannheim, Germany) could decrease the rate of adverse events in ACS patients treated with\n      PCI and with HTPR during early and late period of DAPT treatment.\n\n      Cut off values for HTPR and enhanced platelet response were set according to the consensus\n      statement at >46 U and <19 U, respectively. PFT and therapy tailoring was performed at day\n      1, 2, 3, 7, 30 and month 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12."
