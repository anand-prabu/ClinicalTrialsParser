In the study, a high-resolution MRI scan is used as ground truth for a laser\n      scan of the forehead. The laser scan is acquired point by point with a prototype scanning\n      unit developed at the University of Luebeck's Institute for Robotics.\n\n      The measured tissue thickness using the near-infrared scanning approach is validated against\n      the ground truth obtained by the MRI scan. The average accuracy of the reconstruction method\n      is then computed over all subjects from the individual study arms.\n\n      The required laser intensity and exposure time as well as the achieved measurement accuracy\n      is evaluated with respect to the different skin types of the test subjects. Correlation\n      between these features and the skin type according to the Fitzpatrick scale will be\n      computed.\n\n      For 1/3 of the subjects, the laser and MRI scans are repeated after 2 and 8 weeks. The\n      results of the scans are compared and time dependency is analysed."
