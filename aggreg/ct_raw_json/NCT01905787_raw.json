A third group is a cohort of SCA patients treated at Schneider Children's\n      Hospital Hematology Unit. Those patients belong also to the Israel Arab population and\n      patients from a village that African Muslims live for many years. The characteristics of the\n      three groups will be compared to the characteristics of a fourth group, a cohort of\n      Afro-American SCA patients that are followed up and treated at the Pediatric Hematology\n      Unit, Detroit Children's Medical Center, Detroit, Michigan, USA."

Group 3 - Schneider\n      group - (ShMC): 50 patients will be included in the study.

Pregnant patients: Pregnancy will\n      not be considered as exclusion criteria. Data about pregnancy under Hydroxyurea treatment\n      both in females and in males should be included, including malformations in the offspring.\n      It needs to be emphasized that the recommendation to the patients in both sexes is to stop\n      Hydroxyurea treatment at last three months before conception.\n\n      Data collection: Data will be collected from the medical files. Demographic and family\n      history and laboratory findings at diagnosis will be included.\n\n      Genetic mutations of the \u03b2 globin gene in patients with Sickle Cell \u03b2 thalassemia will be\n      included if previously analyzed and recorded in medical files. Also \u03b1 globin mutations and\n      SCA haplotypes will be included if they were previously analyzed and are part of the data\n      already present in the medical files.\n\n      Further genetic analysis including \u03b2 and \u03b1 globin mutations, haplotypes and xmn1\n      polymorphism will be included in an extension study but those analysis are not an integral\n      part of this initial study unless they were performed before this present study.\n\n      Clinical complaints from the last 10 years will be summarized. Iron chelation and\n      Hydroxyurea treatment given in the last 10 years will be summarized.\n\n      Complications that were diagnosed at any age will also be recorded.\n\n      Exclusion criteria:\n\n        -  Patients without sufficient data at the medical files due to lack of regular follow up\n           will be excluded.\n\n        -  Patients that give explicit refuse in participation.\n\n      Inclusion criteria:\n\n        -  All the patients currently treated and followed up at the centers in Israel will be\n           included.\n\n        -  A similar number of patients at same age range and same diagnosis will be included from\n           the whole cohort at Detroit MC. Since at Detroit MC a significant larger number of\n           patients, the criteria for patient's selection at this center will be a cohort matched\n           for gender and age to the Israel patients."
