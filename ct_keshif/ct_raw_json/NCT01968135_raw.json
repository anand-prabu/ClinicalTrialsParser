ENG contraceptive implants are easily inserted and removed (1,2), offer quick return\n      to fertility (2), are cost-effective and cost-saving (3,4) and offer non-contraceptive\n      benefits such as improvement in pain for patients with complaints of dysmenorrhea (5).\n\n      Hypothesis:  Women using ENG contraceptive implants who report a bleeding-spotting episode\n      of at least seven days will be more likely to stop bleeding within 3 days of beginning a\n      14-day course of combined oral hormonal steroids compared to women receiving 14 days of\n      placebo."
