However, in some cases obtaining lung tissue is necessary to establish a final\n      diagnosis. The current standard procedure is transbronchial forceps biopsy - if not\n      sufficient: surgical lung biopsy. Transbronchial lung biopsy bears essential limitations\n      however:\n\n        -  Small tissue sample\n\n        -  Limited evaluability of the material caused by forceps-induced crush artifacts\n\n      In cryobiopsy the cryoprobe\u00b4s tip is being cooled and thereby cools the surrounding tissue\n      to approximately minus 89 degrees Celsius. Subsequently, the frozen probe is retracted with\n      the frozen tissue being attached onto the frozen probe's tip. When applied in the central\n      airways, cryobiopsy proved to deliver large specimens of good quality, which may exceed\n      forceps biopsies in terms of diagnostic yield. Pilot studies on transbronchial cryobiopsy\n      showed that same advantages as seen in the endobronchial use."
