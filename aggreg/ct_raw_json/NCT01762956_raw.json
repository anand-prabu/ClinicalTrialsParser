            "textblock": "The pelvic floor disorders are a major problem in our current society with manifestations of\n      micturition disorders, defecatory problems and sexual dysfunction. The pelvic floor muscles\n      training arouses interest due the few studies on this subject. Studies are being conducted\n      with emphasis on the post-prostatectomy urinary disorders, however, not associated with\n      radiotherapy. The study of the effect of radiotherapy in these muscles is still uncertain.\n      At right, we do not know if the effect of radiation can trigger important anatomical changes\n      that could lead to pelvic floor disorders manifesting clinically as defecatory and urinary\n      disorders. These issues motivate us to research, focusing on the evaluation of these muscles\n      through magnetic nuclear resonance considering that radiation therapy has been increasingly\n      used as a therapeutic option in the treatment of prostate cancer. The primary objective of\n      this is to verify the effect of pelvic floor muscles training through magnetic resonance\n      imaging in patients undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Secondary objectives are\n      limited in to evaluate the quality of life index of the sample measured using WHO Quality of\n      Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) and investigate the effect of irradiation of the prostate on the\n      strength and myoelectric activity of the pelvic floor muscles evaluated by perineometry and\n      electromyography respectively. The assessment of the changes occurred by the effect of\n      radiation separately and jointly to the training of the pelvic floor muscles can help us to\n      better understand some of the dysfunctions presented in this sample of patients as well as\n      understanding the effect and the possible contribution of training of these muscles for\n      treatment and/or prevention of these disorders."

This research\n           consists in four assessment: (1) Assessment 01: before started of radiotherapy; (2)\n           Assessment 02: after 06 months started of radiotherapy; (3) Assessment 03: 06 months\n           after the assessment 02; (4) Assessment 04: 06 months after the assessment 03. All\n           these assessments will be common for the participants of the research independently\n           from the group they belong.\n\n      In each assessment, images of the pelvic floor muscles will be acquired by nuclear magnetic\n      resonance. Parallel to the MRI, there will be a clinical assessment of the patient which\n      consist of anamnesis and physical examination, where the assessment of pelvic floor muscle\n      function will be tested objectively using a perineometer to evaluate the peak and the mean\n      contraction as well as the duration of the performed sustained contraction. Data will be\n      collected from three contractions, whose mean value will be used for this study. The\n      myoelectric activity will be evaluated using electromyography biofeedback with\n      electromyography anal probes. The patient will also answer a quality of life questionnaire\n      (WHOQOL-BREF) which consists of 26 questions, where two questions are general issues of\n      quality of life and the other representing the 24 facets that make up the original\n      instrument, the WHOQOL-100: physical domain, the psychological domain and social\n      relationships, environment.\n\n      The patient of TG will be included in a supervised training protocol of the pelvic floor\n      muscles. This protocol will be conducted in conjunction with the radiotherapy sessions.\n\n      The supervised muscle training will be conducted twice a week with 45 minutes each session\n      during 12 weeks (3 months), 24 sessions in total. In addition to the supervised sessions,\n      patients in this group will be instructed about the practice of home exercises and receive a\n      guidance booklet of exercises accompanied by an audio CD with explanations of each exercise\n      to be performed. The patient will be encouraged to perform the exercises while listening to\n      the audio CD for better adherence to the program. These exercises must be performed daily\n      and should be written down in the worksheet when they are performed. After this 3 month\n      period, the patients will be encouraged to continue the exercise protocol at home without\n      supervision. They must attend monthly to monitor adherence to home exercises.\n\n      The control group (CG) patients will not be instructed to perform pelvic floor exercises,\n      instead they will only be assessed within the stipulated time."
