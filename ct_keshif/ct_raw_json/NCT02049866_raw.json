            "textblock": "Osteoporosis in premenopausal women with normal menstrual function and no specific cause is\n      termed idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP). IOP is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of\n      <200,000 affected premenopausal women in the United States.\n\n      Investigators are currently enrolling 40 premenopausal women with IOP into a new,\n      randomized, 24-month, FDA Orphan Diseases Program-funded trial, \"A Phase 2 Study of\n      Teriparatide for the Treatment of Idiopathic Osteoporosis in Premenopausal Women\"\n      (NCT01440803). The follow-up data from our pilot study lead the investigators to conclude\n      that participants in FD003902 will require antiresorptive treatment to prevent bone loss\n      after completing TPTD. Denosumab, a potent inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption,\n      leads to continuous gains in both trabecular and cortical BMD. Moreover, denosumab is not\n      retained in the skeleton, and may thus be preferable for use in young women who may be\n      contemplating future pregnancies. The investigators hypothesize that denosumab, initiated\n      after completion of two years of TPTD, will maintain or improve central and peripheral areal\n      and volumetric BMD, microstructure and stiffness in premenopausal women with IOP. The\n      investigators will test this hypothesis in a 24-month study of denosumab (Prolia\u00ae, 60mg SC\n      every 6 months).  As planned enrollment in NCT01440803 is 40 women and some may not choose\n      to participate, power is too low for a randomized, placebo-controlled design. Therefore, the\n      investigators  plan an open-label, pilot study. The goals of the study are to estimate the\n      effects of denosumab on central and peripheral, as well as trabecular and cortical, bone\n      mass and microstructure and to obtain preliminary data to inform the design of a future\n      randomized study. This study presents the first opportunity to study the effects of\n      denosumab after TPTD in this unique and severely affected group of young women."
