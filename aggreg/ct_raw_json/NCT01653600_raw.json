After one month from index procedure, clopidogrel will be stopped and changed into cilostazol. Patients were randomized to receive cilostazol 100mg bid either 11 month duration or 5 month duration in separate groups of SMART stent group and LifeStent group.

The nitinol stent has proven superior primary patency than\n      balloon angioplasty in superficial femoral artery lesions. Recent stent design improvements\n      focus on decreasing stent fracture rates which can negatively impact patency rates by\n      rearranging strut alignment. In vitro, Stefan et al. reported difference in stent design\n      might play a major role in the appearance of stent strut fracture related to restenosis and\n      reocclusion. Also, several retrospective or registry clinical studies reported stent\n      fractures were associated with a higher risk of in-stent restenosis and reocclusion. In the\n      literature, however, prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial for comparison of\n      stent fracture and primary patency between different nitinol stents has never been performed\n      except one study; SMART versus Luminexx stent named SuperSL trial (lesion length between\n      5-22 cm). Furthermore, in the Asian population, the study of this type have never been\n      performed. LifeStent is similar to S.M.A.R.T. stent in the design consisted of the\n      peak-to-valley connected with S-shaped bridge but is different in lesser bridge (4 bridge\n      vs. 6 bridge), large cell size on stent ends, and larger cell size than S.M.A.R.T. On the\n      other hand, 2011 ESC guideline recommended that dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a\n      thienopyridine for at least one month is recommended after infrainguinal bare-metal-stent\n      implantation. Recent meta-analysis has shown that the efficaty of cilostazol in the\n      atherosclerotic femoropopliteal lesion was proven. However, still specific data regarding a\n      variety of antiplatelet regimen in implanted femoropopliteal lesion are limited.
