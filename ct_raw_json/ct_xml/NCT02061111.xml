  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously, studies have shown that children of women with thyroid autoantibodies experience
      more birth complications and poorer health in their first days. Studies have also shown
      later signs of cognitive developmental challenges (risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity
      problems) among children of mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease. In Denmark there is no
      formalized screening or treatment of subclinical thyroid disease - with or without Thyroid
      Peroxidase Antibodies (TPO-antibodies) - among pregnant women.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the offspring of women with subclinical thyroid disease
      have a mitochondria-dysfunction which leads to more complications during birth, poorer
      health and well-being in the early childhood. The investigators will test this by recruiting
      mothers by a blood sample in the third trimester of pregnancy, screen the cord blood at
      birth and later on test the children with Bayley test two times in the early childhood.
