The proportion with HCV viraemia in this population\n      will be determined through three cross-sectional surveys; at enrolment (2014-2015),\n      follow-up 1 (2016) and follow-up 2 (2018).  Participation will involve providing informed\n      consent, collection of limited clinic and demographic information, a dried blood spot\n      sample, patient completed CEASE questionnaires and FibroScan\u00ae (where available).  It is\n      estimated that approximately 1000 HIV-HCV coinfected individuals will be enrolled into the\n      CEASE-D database.\n\n      Modelling (CEASE-M):\n\n      Mathematical modeling will be undertaken to examine various treatment strategies, including\n      HCV treatment scale-up timelines. The data from the first cross-sectional survey of the HCV\n      surveillance phase (CEASE-D) will inform components of the modeling.\n\n      HCV Education for HIV prescribers (CEASE-E):\n\n      A comprehensive education program in HCV treatment with interferon-free DAA therapy will be\n      conducted with HIV prescribers with high HCV caseloads in preparation for the rapid scale-up\n      of HCV treatment.\n\n      HCV Treatment Scale-Up (CEASE-T):\n\n      An initial pilot phase will involve clinics (tertiary care and primary care) with existing\n      HCV treatment programs, with early access to interferon-free DAA regimens pre-PBS listing\n      through pharma-sponsored early access schemes or clinical trials protocols. This will be\n      followed by an expanded phase following PBS listing."
