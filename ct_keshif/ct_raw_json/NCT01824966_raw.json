According to the World Health\n      Organisation (WHO), a true signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCca) is defined as an\n      adenocarcinoma in which the predominant component (more than 50% of the tumor) consists of\n      isolated or small groups of SRC in the stroma. If the tumor contains less than 50% of those\n      cells, it is generally considered as an adenocarcinoma (ADC)."
