The study will focus on members\n      working for medium to large employers that have more than 90% of employees enrolled in\n      deductible and tiered network health plans. The study will use an interrupted time series\n      (ITS) design that includes  random allocation of half of these employers to a study arm that\n      will receive enhanced promotion of the tool and a $500 lottery incentive for its use in\n      order to increase take-up.  With these two study groups (a \"high-dose\" group receiving\n      enhanced promotion and a lottery, and a \"low-dose\" group receiving routine promotion of the\n      tool), the study will be able to evaluate whether access to a price transparency tool leads\n      to reduced costs and more value-driven member behavior, and whether extra promotion\n      increases take-up.\n\n      Members in the high-dose group who use the tool will be eligible to enter a monthly lottery\n      to win a $500 prize during the 12-month intervention period.   In addition to the lottery,\n      employers in the high-dose group will receive additional promotional strategies such as a\n      mailing and messages through the plan's member web portal to promote the tool and the\n      lottery, and e-mails and flyers for employers to promote the tool and lottery to employees.\n\n      The aims of this project are to: 1) examine take-up of the tool and factors that predict\n      take-up; and 2) to examine the impact of the tool on total and out-of-pocket health care\n      costs and utilization"
