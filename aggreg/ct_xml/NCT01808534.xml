  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well palifosfamide works in treating patients with recurrent
      germ cell tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as palifosfamide, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]) of single
      agent palifosfamide in patients with refractory germ cell tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of remission. II. To determine progression free and overall
      survival. III. To assess toxicity and tolerability of palifosfamide in patients with germ
      cell tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive palifosfamide intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
