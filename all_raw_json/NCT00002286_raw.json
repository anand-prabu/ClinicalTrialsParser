Retrovir has been shown to be effective in the treatment of AIDS. In\n      addition, the administration of AZT appears to have induced a remission of psoriasis in one\n      case study. In light of AZT's antiviral activity and potential effectiveness as an agent for\n      the treatment of psoriasis, this would be the most likely treatment for HIV positive,\n      psoriatic patients whose disease progresses quickly."
