  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that there will be a decrease in internal jugular venous flow in the park
      bench position when compared to the supine position. There will also be a change in blood
      flow in the between right and left internal jugular veins in park bench position,
      particularly there will be a greater reduction of flow on the dependent side. However, the
      internal jugular venous flow will be the same in both the prone and supine position.

      The different positions used in neurosurgery (park bench, prone) for better accessibility to
      the operating field can impact on the cerebral venous drainage due to the effects of
      internal jugular venous outflow of blood and may increase intracranial pressure. The kinking
      of the internal jugular vein due to excessive neck flexion and rotation in park bench or
      flexion in the prone position may lead to kinking or twisting of the vein. This has been
      hypothesized as the major cause of disturbed venous drainage during surgery and in
      postoperative patients may lead to neck swelling, brachial plexus injury, macroglossia
      (swollen tongue), delayed airway obstruction and increases in intracranial pressure.

      Optimal brain perfusion is best in the neutral position of the head, but surgery cannot
      always be performed with this. Thus, we look to measure the internal jugular venous flow at
      different positions as there have been little studies looking at this important contributing
      factor.

    <description>Measuring the venous blood flow of healthy volunteers by the use of an ultrasound and Doppler velocimetry in three different positions. The prone and park bench positions will be compared to the supine position with the head in neutral position with the standard pillow used in the operating room. We will be looking at both sides of internal jugular venous flow in all three positions particularly to determine if there is any obstruction to the internal jugular venous flow. We can calculate the flow of venous blood in the internal jugular. The internal jugular vein cross sectional area may be measured with an ultrasound. The velocity of blood flow is measured with the M mode of an ultrasound. Venous blood flow is calculated from the measured cross sectional area and measured doppler velocity.</description>
