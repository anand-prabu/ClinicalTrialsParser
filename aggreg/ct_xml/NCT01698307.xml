  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract.
      During disease exacerbations, pharmacological or surgical intervention is usually needed to
      re-establish remission.  Ideally, strategies should be employed to maintain patients in
      long-term remission while minimizing exposure to corticosteroids and reduce therapy-related
      toxicity.

      Nevertheless, in reality many patients with CD do not receive effective therapy and their
      disease often remains active, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and complications from
      either the underlying disease or corticosteroids.
