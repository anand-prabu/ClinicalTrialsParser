To determine if CR-CHOP improves the rates of progression free survival (PFS) patients\n      DLBCL relative to R-CHOP due to an improvement in outcomes specifically for patients with\n      the activated B-cells (ABC) subtype. (Phase II)\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib followed by a phase II\n      study.\n\n      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over at least 90 minutes, cyclophosphamide IV\n      over 30-60 minutes, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 3-5 minutes, vincristine sulfate IV\n      over 1 minute on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5.
