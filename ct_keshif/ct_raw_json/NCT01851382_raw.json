These\n      samples can help better understand serious side effects and complications of transplant\n      treatments in patients. This study will collect saliva samples from healthy volunteers.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To collect saliva samples from healthy volunteers for research studies.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy men ages 30-70 years for Phase I of the study.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history questionnaire. They will also have\n           a brief oral exam to check for any mouth infection.\n\n        -  Participants will provide a saliva sample. The collection process will take about 5\n           minutes.\n\n        -  No treatment will be given as part of this study."

Although oral\n           cGVHD occurs in > 25% of cGVHD patients and leads to decreased quality of life, its\n           etiology is poorly understood.\n\n        -  The primary objective of the present protocol is to enroll normal volunteers who will\n           contribute a saliva sample in order to compare its characteristics with those of\n           patients with and without chronic GVHD after allogeneic HSCT. The normal control saliva\n           samples will provide a standard of comparison for patient saliva samples from ongoing\n           NCI cGVHDrelated protocols.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      -To collect approximately 5 ml of saliva and/or 18 cc peripheral blood from healthy\n      volunteers as needed to support research activities.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Healthy individuals (including employees) all racial/ethnic groups, aged 18 years or\n           older.\n\n        -  Volunteers must be willing to undergo saliva collection.\n\n        -  No active illnesses, immunodeficiency, history of opportunistic infection, autoimmune\n           disease, immunosuppressive medications or prior organ, bone marrow or peripheral blood\n           stem cell transplant.\n\n        -  Ability of subject to understand and provide written informed consent.\n\n        -  Phase I of the study will be restricted to males, age 30-70 years\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Healthy volunteers will be offered the opportunity to participate in this protocol.\n\n        -  A basic clinical dental assessment will be done.\n\n        -  Saliva samples will be collected from the consenting subject.\n\n        -  Protein assays will be performed on the collected saliva sample."
