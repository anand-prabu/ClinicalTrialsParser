  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physical and biological properties of the carbon ion beam promise to improve the
      therapeutic ratio in patients with pancreatic cancer: Due to the inverted dose profile dose
      deposition in the entry channel of the beam leads to sparing of normal tissue; the Bragg
      peak can be directed into the defined target volume, and the sharp dose fall-off thereafter
      again spares normal tissue behind the target volume. The higher RBE of carbon ions, which
      has been shown also for pancreatic cancer cell lines in the preclinical setting, is likely
      to contribute to an increase in local control, and perhaps in OS. Early data from Japanese
      centers have shown convincing results. The PHOENIX-01 trial is the first trial to evaluate
      actively delivered carbon ion beams in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
      within a dose-escalation strategy.
