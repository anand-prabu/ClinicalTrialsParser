            "textblock": "Folic acid (~400 \u00b5g/day) taken around the time of conception significantly reduces the risk\n      of a neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancy. Strategies to reduce NTD with folic acid,\n      include supplement use and food fortification. An attractive strategy for NTD prevention is\n      the use of fortified foods targeted for use by women planning a pregnancy. Fonterra\n      currently markets a fortified-milk (ANMUM Materna) in Asia, designed for use prior to and\n      during pregnancy. This milk product, if consumed as directed, provides ~400 \u00b5g folic acid\n      per day. It is not known whether ANMUM Materna will reduce NTD rate.  However, in a\n      case-control study the risk of NTD was inversely associated with maternal red blood cell\n      (RBC) folate concentrations. Accordingly, if ANMUM Materna increases RBC folate, it could be\n      expected to decrease NTD risk.\n\n      In this study, the ANMUM Materna fortified milk will be tested against a standard control\n      (unfortified) milk over a 12 week period. The subjects will consume 75g of milk powder daily\n      throughout the supplementation period."
