  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate tolerability when SyB L-1101 is administered
      intravenously in patients with recurrent/relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome, to
      determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose, and to estimate the
      recommended dose for phase II studies. Pharmacokinetics and antitumor effects will also be
      investigated.

    <description>SyB L-1101（rigosertib sodium） will be administered to two cohorts at either 1,200 mg/day or 1,800 mg/day.
The dose will be administered intravenously for 72 continuous hours (3 days), followed by 11-day observation period. The treatment period of 14 days (3 days of administration + 11 days of observation) constitutes 1 cycle.
The study will involve treatment through the second cycle, but treatment can be continued for 3 or more cycles if conditions for continued administration are satisfied.</description>

             administration).

             •Male patients
