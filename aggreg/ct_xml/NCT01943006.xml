    <textblock>
      Patients receiving nutritional emulsion for at least 3 days will be treated with Hirudoid
      cream or placebo cream to prevent and treat phlebitis caused by the infusion. The treatment
      is continued after the end of infusion for at least 7 days.

      Number of patients developing superficial phlebitis and duration of phlebitis will be
      recorded.
