      Project title:

      Detection of atrial fibrillation in patients with recent stroke or TIA: Validity of
      automated loop-recording (Rtest) compared to Holter recording and predictive value of short
      runs of atrial fibrillation and an excess supraventricular extra systoles for a new stroke

      Abstract:

      Stroke constitutes a major health problem both nationally and globally. Each year 15 million
      people worldwide are attacked by stroke. In Denmark stroke hits 14.000 people a year and is
      the third leading cause of death. In this research project, we will examine the heart rate
      of more than 1,500 patients whom within 1 week has had a blood clot in the brain (ischemic
      stroke) or have had symptoms of a blood clot in the brain, which has dwindled within 24
      hours (TIA). There are no clear international or national guidelines regarding the optimal
      way to detect atrial fibrillation in stroke and TIA patients, though atrial fibrillation is
      known to increase fivefold the risk of stroke. Holter recording with two days
      electrocardiogram is considered as the golden standard for investigation of heart rhythm
      disturbances and is offered at Department of Neurology in Holstebro, where we recruit
      patients. Holter recording is a resource-intensive procedure in data analysis. Project
      patients will be mounted with a 2- day Holter and Rtest for either 2 or 7 days. The Rtest is
      a loop recorder and a new device on the market that continuously monitor and opposite a
      Holter recorder, automatically analyses heart rhythm. The validity of the Rtest with regard
      to detect atrial fibrillation compared to Holter is unknown and is what we which to clarify.
      Additionally we use the 2-day Holter recordings to test whether short-term rhythm disorders
      as atrial fibrillation &lt;30 seconds, and/or many extra heartbeats (supraventricular extra
      systoles) increases the risk of stroke recurrence. Patients will be followed in the Danish
      Stroke Register. If an increased risk is found, these gray area patients who are currently
      not offered anticoagulant therapy, may prove to have treatment indication. If the study
      shows that loop recording can replace Holter recording it will mean an economic gain. The
      study is expected to contribute substantial evidence for the future treatment of stroke and
      TIA patients.Stroke constitutes a major health problem both nationally and globally. Each
