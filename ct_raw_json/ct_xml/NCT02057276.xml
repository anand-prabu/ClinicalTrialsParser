  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) can augment occupational therapy in improving motor function in children
      (10 years of age or older) and young adults (&lt; 21 years of age) with chronic hemiparesis
      from either stroke or cerebral palsy. RTMS is a noninvasive technology that can induce
      changes in brain function that may lead to functional improvement in people with
      hemiparesis.  This is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled rTMS study in
      conjunction with intensive daily occupational therapy (OT) for 2 weeks to improve motor
      function in hemiparetic patients. Participants will be followed for at least 12 weeks after
      rTMS to detect any clinical change. The sham group participants will be offered an
      open-label active rTMS treatment plus OT after the 12 week assessment.
