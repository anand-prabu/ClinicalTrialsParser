A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters\n             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside\n             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the\n             Investigator determines that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk\n             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.\n\n          -  Body mass index within the range 18 to 35 kilograms/meter squared (m^2) (inclusive).\n\n          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:\n\n        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal\n        ligation or hysterectomy (for this definition, \"documented\" refers to the outcome of the\n        investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility,\n        as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical\n        records); or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in\n        questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone > 40\n        milli international unit/mililiter [mL] and estradiol < 40 picogram/mL [<147\n        picomoles/liter] is confirmatory.  Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose\n        menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if\n        they wish to continue their HRT during the study.  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to\n        allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.  For most forms of\n        HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood\n        draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their\n        post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a\n        contraceptive method.\n\n        Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human\n        chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing.\n\n        Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as\n        determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to\n        sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.
