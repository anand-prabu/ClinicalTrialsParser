The primary objectives of this study are to assess\n      the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and establish the Recommended\n      Phase Two Dose of ABT-199 when administered in combination with rituximab. The dose\n      escalation portion of the study will include approximately 30 subjects.  Once the\n      recommended phase two dose and schedule have been determined, up to 20 additional subjects\n      will be enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the study."
