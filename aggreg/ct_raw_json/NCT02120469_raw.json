To determine the safety and tolerability of everolimus and eribulin (eribulin mesylate),\n      and determine the recommended Phase IB dose (RP2D) of the drug combination in patients with\n      resistant metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the\n      event-free survival (EFS) rate for patients with resistant metastatic TNBC at the RP2D of\n      everolimus and eribulin to determine if the drug combination is worthy of further study.\n      (Phase IB)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine response rate in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) II. To\n      determine overall survival (OS) in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) III.\n      To determine toxicity in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) IV. To\n      determine pharmacokinetics (PK) for everolimus and eribulin in patients with resistant\n      metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) V. To collect blood, skin punch biopsies, and tumor biopsies\n      before and after treatment from all patients and perform proteomic analysis to determine the\n      level of inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway in tumor cells\n      versus non-therapeutic targets. (Phase IB)\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.\n\n      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and eribulin mesylate\n      intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
