Staging describes the severity of a person's cancer\n      based on the size and/or extent (reach) of the original (primary) tumor and whether or not\n      cancer has spread in the body. It also helps the doctor plan the appropriate treatment.\n      Optical coherence tomography is a procedure that uses infrared light waves to give\n      three-dimensional pictures of structures inside tissues and organs. The pictures are made by\n      a computer linked to the light source. Optical coherence tomography may be effective in\n      staging patients with upper-tract urothelial carcinomas."
