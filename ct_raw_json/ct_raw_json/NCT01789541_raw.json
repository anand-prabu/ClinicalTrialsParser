            "textblock": "Overt hyperthyroidism (so-called \"goiter\" in lay language) is a hormonal disturbance that is\n      known to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (a common heart arrhythmia with\n      potentially severe consequences) in some patients. Previous research has indicated that even\n      slight elevations in thyroid hormone levels - so called subclinical hyperthyroidism - may\n      increase this risk. When atrial fibrillation and overt hyperthyroidism are found\n      simultaneously in a patient, the hormonal imbalance must be treated first in order to later\n      resolve the arrhythmia. It is unclear whether this strategy holds true for subclinical\n      hyperthyroidism. Our two hypotheses are: 1) Subclinical hyperthyroidism is more prevalent in\n      patients admitted for atrial fibrillation ablation than in the population as a whole, and 2)\n      Patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation benefit less from ablation\n      than others.\n\n      As a control group, we have chosen patients admitted for ablation of AV-nodal Reentry\n      Tachycardia at the same clinics as the cases. No correlation has ever been shown between\n      AV-nodal Reentry Tachycardia and hyperthyroidism."
