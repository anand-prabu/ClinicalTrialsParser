Treatment repeats every 21\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of Huang Lian until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-liming toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
