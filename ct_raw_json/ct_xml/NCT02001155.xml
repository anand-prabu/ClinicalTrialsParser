  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A test that was common in the 1960's and was used to detect primary open angle glaucoma was
      the water drinking test (patients drank 1 quart of water to stress the fluid drainage
      mechanism of the eyes.  Intraocular pressure was then measured over the next hour).
      Recently this test has been demonstrated as a predictor of peak eye pressure during the day.
       The purpose of this study is to compare the results of the water drinking test between eyes
      that have undergone trabeculectomy and eyes that have undergone tube shunt surgery.

    <description>The Water Drinking test has been identified as a reliable and safe tool to predict maximum intraocular pressure values during a diurnal tension curve and to assess the efficacy of surgical interventions. Participants are asked to drink 10 ml/kg water (or approximately 0.33 ounces of water for every 2.2 pounds of weight or about 2.5 cups for a 150 lb. individual) over 15 minutes. Intraocular pressure is assessed every 15 minutes for one hour.</description>

        All participants will have open angle glaucoma and have undergone either tube shunt
        surgery or trabeculectomy. All participants will be matched for range of recent
        intraocular pressure (average over the prior three visits of &lt;12 mm Hg, 12 to &lt;18 mm Hg,
        or &gt;18 mm Hg), as well as number of medications (none, 1-2, 3 or more).
