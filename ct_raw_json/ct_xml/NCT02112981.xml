      This study is conducted to evaluate the multicenter investigation comparing the BioMime
      Sirolimus Drug Eluting stent with XIENCE family of (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara,
      California, USA) in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Considering that
      the randomized studies provide a better comparability and a real efficacy and safety data of
      the devices. Subjects will be randomized 2:1  with surrogate endpoints and clinical
      evaluation.

      Subject included in study are eligible to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the
      study protocol .The informed consent process will be performed before the subject underwent
      for the Procedure. Subject will be treated with treatment allocated by the process of
      Randomization. The study follow up will be Seattle angina score evaluation up to 2 years
      after the procedure of angioplasty along with the Hospital  or telephonic follow up at 1
      Month  5month ,1 and 2 years and angiographic follow up at 9 Month.

             transfusions

             significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed within the past 6 months

          -  The patient has renal insufficiency as determined by a creatinine of &gt; 2.0mg/dl or
             180 µmol/l.

          -  The target lesion, or the target vessel proximal to the target lesion contains

          -  The patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French
             sheath insertion or extreme angulations of the vessel at accesslocation (&lt; 45
             degrees)

          -  The patient has other medical illness (i.e., cancer or congestive heart failure) that
             may cause the patient to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data
             interpretation or is associated with limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one
             year)
