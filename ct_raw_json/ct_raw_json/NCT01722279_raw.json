The interview includes\n      scripts that the caller will use to recruit subjects in either direct conversation, in voice\n      mail or by leaving a message.  Recruitment will cease after 400 complete post pilot\n      interviews are obtained.\n\n      The interview covers topics related to physical and psychological health and quality of\n      life.  The number of questions asked will vary from subject to subject since some questions\n      are asked only if a prior question is answered affirmatively.  For example, if a subject\n      responds \"yes\" when asked \"have you had plastic surgery?\" the subject is then asked what\n      type of procedure they had.  The topics covered are as follows:  weight, current health,\n      post surgery complications, relationships, work, cross addiction, mental health, diet,\n      television viewing, exercise, and life satisfaction."
