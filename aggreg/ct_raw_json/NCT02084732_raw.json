            "textblock": "Differentiated thyroid cancer includes papillary, follicular, Hurthle cell, and\n      C-cell/medullary carcinoma. Even though incidence is relatively low (1% of all neoplasms), a\n      rise in this disease has been recorded in the country (The Atlas of Cancer Mortality in\n      Colombia, 2010).\n\n      Although this disease has a low rate of attributable mortality, the costs arising from\n      treatment, monitoring, and disabilities among affected patients and their families are high\n      for the health system.\n\n      The therapeutic approach to differentiated thyroid cancer once it starts progressing is\n      limited; there are no truly favorable treatment options for patients with advanced thyroid\n      cancer: available options include surgery, radiotherapy, and radioactive iodine therapy.\n\n      Molecular biology now allows the identification of the effects of mutations and alterations\n      in the proteins that participate in cell signaling which account for dedifferentiation,\n      invasiveness, and the progression of neoplastic cells.\n\n      VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) is one of the main molecules to be\n      addressed by targeted molecular therapy. Its increased expression in differentiated thyroid\n      cancer has been demonstrated and has been associated with increased growth, invasiveness,\n      and shorter recurrence-free survival.\n\n      Different agents are effective against this tyrosine kinase receptor; nevertheless, taking\n      into account that it is not solely responsible for tumor progression, according to clinical\n      study results, it is more reasonable to use non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as\n      sorafenib and motesanib. These inhibitors have already been tested in phase II studies.\n\n      Results from recent phase II research studies using these emerging treatment options have\n      shown important effects in the therapeutic approach to other solid neoplasms.\n\n      Information about the safety of this type of treatment is limited; a need for information\n      regarding the use of new therapeutic approaches in Colombia is one of the contributions that\n      the National Institute of Cancer can make to the country through this study."
