      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab in patients with asthma who
      participated in a previous dupilumab asthma study; ie DRI12544.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with asthma who participated in a previous
      dupilumab asthma clinical study.

      Evaluate dupilumab in patients with asthma who participated in a previous dupilumab asthma
      clinical study, with regard to:

        -  Systemic exposure

        -  Anti-drug antibodies

        -  Biomarkers

      The total duration of study participation includes a screening period of up to 3 weeks
      (drug-free), followed by an open-label treatment period of 96 weeks and a 16-week
      post-treatment period (drug-free).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Eligible patients who have completed a previous dupilumab asthma study (ie,
             DRI12544).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients who did not complete the previous dupilumab asthma study (entire study
             duration).

          -  Patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions to dupilumab.

          -  Patients diagnosed with active parasitic infection; suspected or at high risk of
             parasitic infection, unless clinical and/or laboratory assessments before
             randomization have ruled out an active infection.

          -  Medical history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Known or suspected medical history of immunosuppression, including history of
             invasive opportunistic infections (eg, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, listeriosis,
             coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystosis, aspergillosis) despite infection resolution; or
             unusually frequent, recurrent or prolonged infections, as per investigator judgment.

          -  Evidence of acute or chronic infection requiring treatment with antibacterials,
             antivirals, antifungals, antiparasitics or antiprotozoals within 4 weeks before Visit
             1; significant viral infections within 4 weeks before Visit 1 that may not have
             received antiviral treatment (eg, influenza receiving only symptomatic treatment).

          -  Patients with any event or laboratory abnormality that, as per investigator judgment,
             would adversely affect participation of the patient in this study.

          -  Patients who have traveled to parasitic endemic area within 6 months prior to
             screening.

          -  The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
             patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
