Using local anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the\n      adipose tissue specimen. The adipose tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for\n      separation of the adipose tissue derived stem cells.  In addition, peripheral blood will be\n      collected for isolation of platelet rich plasma, which are then combined with the ASC's for\n      intramuscular injection into the lower limb."
