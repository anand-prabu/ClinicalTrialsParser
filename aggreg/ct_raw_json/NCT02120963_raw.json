Participants are\n      randomized to an intervention group or a waiting list control group.\n\n      Intervention: The 12-week intervention period begins with an individual person-centered\n      meeting to develop an individualized feasible self-care plan for the participant with extra\n      focus on health-enhancing physical activity, stress management (relaxation exercise training\n      and modified mindfulness techniques) and balance in daily life. A written consent, aiming to\n      increase coherence, is signed. The participants will be asked to keep a journal about their\n      strategies and reflections. Follow up meetings and contacts will be planned according to\n      personal preferences.\n\n      Procedure: The participants are invited to a clinical examination before and after the\n      12-week intervention and at 6-month follow-up, assessing demographic data, disease activity,\n      inflammation parameters, physical capacity and questionnaires of health status in RA.\n      Primary outcome are questionnaires of single item- and multidimensional fatigue.\n\n      Analysis: Effects of the interventions will be analyzed using non-parametric statistics for\n      between-group changes over time. Within-group changes over time will be analyzed for each\n      group.\n\n      Expected results. New knowledge of fatigue is of importance for improvement of overall\n      health of people with RA, as fatigue influences all aspects of their life, both private life\n      and employment, thus decreasing the quality of life."
