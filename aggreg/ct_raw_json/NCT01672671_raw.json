            "textblock": "Recent gene expression profiling of breast cancer has identified specific subtypes with\n      clinical, biologic, and therapeutic implications. The basal-like group of tumors is\n      associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, and typically do not express hormone\n      receptors or HER-2 (\"triple-negative\" phenotype). Therefore, patients with basal-like\n      cancers do not benefit from currently available targeted systemic therapy.\n\n      There is a lot of evidence about a link between basal-like breast cancer and BRCA1\n      deficiency. Many clinical characteristics and molecular features are shared by basal-like\n      breast cancers and tumors that arise in carriers of BRCA1 germline mutations.\n\n      Some studies have indicated that BRCA1 mRNA expression was lower in basal-like sporadic\n      cancers than in controls matched for age and grade. BRCA1 is rarely mutated in sporadic\n      breast cancers and, therefore, it is believed that this may be a result of epigenetic\n      mechanisms such as acquired methylation of the BRCA1 gene promoter or a dysfunction in the\n      pathways that regulate BRCA1 expression, such as overexpression of ID4. The profound\n      similarities between hereditary BRCA1-related breast tumors and basal-like tumors strongly\n      implicate a fundamental defect in the BRCA1 or associated DNA-repair pathways (p53, PTEN) in\n      sporadic basal-like tumors.\n\n      There is increasing evidence that the BRCA1-related DNA-repair defects, especially defective\n      homologous recombination, determines sensitivity to certain agents, such as platinum\n      salts-based chemotherapy. The complexity in downregulation of BRCA1 expression suggests that\n      these approaches may only be effective in the treatment of a subset of sporadic basal-like\n      cancers. Identification of specific markers for these cancers will be essential to translate\n      an understanding of defective DNA repair into targeted treatments for this poor prognosis\n      subtype."
