    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects are asked to wear an actigraph to obtain activity/rest patterns for 7 days prior to intervention and for 7 days after 3 weeks that the light treatment is applied. These data are used to determine sleep efficiency, circadian disruption, and light dose. Measures that are calculated from the actigraphy data include: sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO).</description>

    <description>Subjects are asked to wear a calibrated light meter to obtain light/dark and activity/rest patterns for 7 days prior to intervention and for 7 days after 3 weeks that the light treatment is applied. These data are used to determine circadian disruption (correlation between light/dark and activity/rest) and light dose.</description>

    <description>Caregivers and subjects are asked to fill out subjective the Pittsburgh Sleepiness Scale Score, which is assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks they are exposed to the lighting intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (week 0) and intervention (week 4)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Caregivers and subjects are asked to fill out subjective questionnaires assessing depression scores (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia and Geriatric Depression Scale). Questionnaires are assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks they are exposed to the lighting intervention.</description>

    <description>Caregivers who live at home with patients are also asked to fill out subjective questionnaires probing their sleep efficiency and quality of life. The Pittsburgh Sleepiness Quality Index (sleep quality), caregiver burden (caregiver strain scale), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia) will be used.</description>
