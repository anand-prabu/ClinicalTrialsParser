GSK is committed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to\n      conduct a safety study to evaluate the incidence of new neurological and eye-related\n      autoimmune diseases and other pre-specified autoimmune diseases in subjects receiving\n      Cervarix\u00ae in the US. Because of the very low Cervarix\u00ae uptake in the US, the observational\n      GSK study to address this commitment is due to be stopped, as it will take too long to\n      recruit the target subjects.\n\n      The unexposed male cohorts will be enrolled in order to assess a possible change over time\n      in the incidence rate of new onset of autoimmune disease(s) (NOAD) in the UK Clinical\n      Practice Research Datalink General Practitioner OnLine database (CPRD GOLD) independent of\n      Cervarix\u00ae introduction. The cohorts will be frequency matched for the age (age class of one\n      year) and practice region identifier at reference date (age at first dose of Cervarix).\n\n      Additionally, the reference date (time = 0) for the vaccinated (exposed) cohort will be the\n      date of the first dose of Cervarix\u00ae recorded in CPRD GOLD. The reference date for the\n      unexposed (unvaccinated) cohorts will be a date randomly selected among the reference dates\n      of the exposed subjects and minus 3 years for the historical cohorts.\n\n      The other observational study model is a self-control case-series (SCCS) analysis for\n      confirmed NOAD in the exposed female cohort, using a risk period of one year after the first\n      Cervarix\u00ae dose, a control period of one year and a six month buffer period between risk and\n      control periods.\n\n      Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16 and 18) vaccine (recombinant) exposed cohort was\n      investigated between 1-SEP-2008 and 31-AUG-2010.\n\n      The unexposed concurrent male cohort was investigated between 1-SEP-2008 and 31-AUG-2010.\n\n      Unexposed historical female and male cohorts were investigated between 1-SEP-2005 and\n      31-AUG-2007."
