The aims of this study is to assess the efficacy of the\n      crossover (group 1) on balance in Parkinsonian patients and compare this results with the\n      results of a control group of patients treated with a stabilometric platform (group 2). The\n      group 1 executed 6 days/week for a 4-weeks cycle a crossover protocol based on the first 4\n      level of resistance and a training which lasts at most 5 minutes. The group 2 executed 6\n      days/week for a 4-weeks cycle different exercises with the stabilometric platform in\n      monopodalic and in bipodalic standing."
