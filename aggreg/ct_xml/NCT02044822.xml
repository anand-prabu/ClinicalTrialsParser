  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of treatment with idelalisib (IDELA) plus rituximab on
      overall response rate (ORR); onset, magnitude, and duration of disease control (including
      duration of response [DOR], progression free survival [PFS], and overall survival [OS]); and
      minimal residual disease (MRD) in subjects with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion. In addition, the study will evaluate the safety profile
      observed with the combination of IDELA and rituximab.
