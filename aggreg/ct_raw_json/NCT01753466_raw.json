Participants who are randomized\n      to the hydration-intervention group will be asked to consume 1.0 to 1.5 L water per day\n      (depending on sex and weight) in addition to usual consumed beverages, for 6 weeks.\n      Participants in the control group will be advised to consume their usual amount of fluid.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that patients will be able to increase and maintain a higher\n      fluid intake with stable blood chemistry, particularly serum sodium."
