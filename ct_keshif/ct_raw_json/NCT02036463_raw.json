Treatment with\n      corticosteroids is standard of care for patients with DMD five years old and older, due to\n      the robust observation that this intervention lengthens the interval prior to loss of\n      ambulation but is associated with many side effects. This clinical trial will be conducted\n      in the youngest age group able to receive corticosteroids orally and on whom study outcomes\n      are measurable, ages 3 to 7 years. This is a randomized, double blinded, double masked,\n      placebo-controlled clinical trial that will explore whether better synchronization of\n      corticosteroid administration with the circadian rhythm will provide improved tolerability\n      and at least comparable efficacy to current standards in which corticosteroids are always\n      given in the morning. Furthermore, the trial provides a unique opportunity to rigorously\n      evaluate corticosteroid effects in the young DMD patient, both for efficacy as compared to\n      placebo and as a study of the impact of corticosteroid chronotherapy, or delayed release, on\n      increased tolerability over standard therapy. The main hypothesis is that synchronization of\n      the timing of corticosteroid dosing will improve medication tolerability in children, while\n      maintaining (non-inferiority) the efficacy of corticosteroid.  The study also offers a\n      unique opportunity to measure several biomarkers as well as novel genetic modifiers that may\n      further impact the response to corticosteroid in DMD."
