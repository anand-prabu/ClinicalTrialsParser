CD4 T cell count >200/\u00b5l at screening in patients\n                  under ART, CD4 T cell count >500/\u00b5l at screening in patients without ART 7. If\n                  female and of childbearing potential, is using effective birth control methods\n                  (as agreed by the investigator) and is willing to continue practising these\n                  birth control methods during the trial and for at least 4 months after the last\n                  dosage of ribavirin (ie 4 months after week 12, 24 or 48, depending on study arm\n                  and treatment response).  Routine monthly pregnancy tests must also be performed\n                  during this time. Note: Women who are postmenopausal for least 2 years, women\n                  with total hysterectomy, and women who have a tubal ligation are considered of\n                  non-childbearing potential 8.

HCV infection with non-1 genotype 2. Acute opportunistic infection requiring\n             treatment 3. Malignancy requiring chemotherapy or radiotherapy 4.

History of ischaemic heart disease or other serious cardiac\n             disease 8. Serious psychiatric disease which in the view of the investigator\n             precludes the use of interferon 9. Haemoglobinopathy or severe anaemia of any cause\n             10. Serious abnormality on screening blood tests including, but not limited to:\n             Hemoglobin <10g/dl, absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm3, platelets <90,000/mm3,\n             creatinine clearance <60ml/min 11. If female, she is pregnant or breastfeeding 12.\n             Known hypersensitivity to one of the trial drugs or its excipients 13. Other\n             contraindicated concomitant treatment 14. Any condition (including drug/alcohol\n             abuse), or laboratory results which in the investigators opinion, interfere with\n             assessments or completion of the trial 15. Any other reason why, in the opinion of\n             the investigator, the patient should not be enrolled in the trial."
