Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with transient elastography is\n      found useful to identify cirrhotic patients with higher risk of portal hypertension and\n      presence of varices at cross-sectional basis. LSM cutoff values of 17.6 kPa and 21.0 kPa\n      would have the sensitivity \u2265 90% in order to detect patients with hepatic venous pressure\n      gradient (HVPG) above 10-12mmHg , while the presence of varices could be confidently\n      excluded with a liver stiffness below 12.5-19.8 kPa. However, these suggested cutoff values\n      overlap with those for detecting histologic cirrhosis in most chronic liver diseases. Hence\n      there seems no significant additional information provided by LSM regarding screening\n      endoscopy for varices among cirrhotic patients.\n\n      Recently, spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) with the same machine was found accurate to\n      predict portal hypertension and esophageal varices. An SSM cutoff value <41.3 kPa is\n      sensitive and seems able to accurately rule out the presence of varices. This supports a\n      possible screening strategy, reserving upper endoscopy only for patients with an SSM\n      \u226541.3kPa."
