Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer\n      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find\n      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer killing substances to them. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide,\n      and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by\n      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy\n      x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may\n      kill more cancer cells and reduce the need for radiation therapy."
