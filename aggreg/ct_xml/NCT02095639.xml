  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) accidentally
      leads to a side effect of brain inflammation. Patients with treatment resistant depression
      who are planning to take ECT will be subsequently approached to participate in the study.

    <textblock>
      The first scan will take place before the first ECT session. The second scan will occur
      after a minimum of six ECT sessions (average 2.5 weeks). Secondary measures will include
      mood symptom severity, neurocognitive measures, peripheral inflammatory markers and TSPO
      genotype.

      The hypothesis is that neuroinflammation will be increased by ECT.

      There will be no alterations to standard care of depressed patients due to participation in
      the study.

    <description>Scores on the 17-item HDRS will be taken at the time of the PET scan (baseline and post-ECT) to assess whether the magnitude of change in TSPO distribution volume is associated with changes in symptom severity.</description>

    <description>Neurocognitive measures will be take at baseline and post-ECT to assess whether TSPO Vt is related to neurocognitive function. Neurocognitive battery includes:
