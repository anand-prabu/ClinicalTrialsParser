The specific objectives of our study are to determine whether multiple\n      doses of nebulized budesonide are effective to reduce or prevent postextubation edema.\n\n      In this double-blind randomized clinical trial study, 70 patients (age between 18 to 65) who\n      are intubated (at least for 48 hours) and now are ready for extubation will be enrolled in\n      the study after obtaining a written informed consent from their parents or guardians.\n\n      The investigators divide our patients randomly into two equal groups.\n\n      -Patients who are in budesonide group will receive nebulized budesonide (1 mg-every 12\n      hours; n=35) and patients in placebo group receive placebo (normal saline; n=35) until 48\n      hours after extubation. If patient have extubation criteria the investigators will extubate\n      him and for 24 hours after, another anesthesiologist who is unaware about kind of\n      medication, will evaluate the patients for severity of stridor. We will record the vital\n      sings and grade of stridor every 6 hour. Respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), blood\n      pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) were recorded for each patient immediately before\n      aerosol administration (time 0) and at 30 and 60 min; and 2,4,8,12,24,36 and 48 hrs. After\n      extubation then the presence of stridor (heard with the aid of stethoscope) was recorded\n      within 48 hr of extubation."
