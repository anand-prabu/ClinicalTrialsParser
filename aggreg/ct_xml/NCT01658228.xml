  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with depression (DEP) and cognitive impairment (CI), represent a unique,
      understudied population that is difficult to diagnose, treat and estimate prognosis. Our
      pilot data, supported by the literature, suggest that many DEP-CI patients show cognitive
      decline and often convert to dementia, primarily Alzheimer's disease (AD). In DEP-CI, there
      is a lack of data on treatment response of mood symptoms to antidepressant treatment and
      particularly of cognitive deficits to cognitive enhancer treatment. Our initial pilot data
      in a double-blind study showed that donepezil was superior to placebo in improving memory in
      antidepressant-treated DEP-CI patients. In a second pilot study, open label es-citalopram
      plus memantine treatment led to a low rate of conversion to dementia.

      In this proposed pilot clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate, treat and follow a
      broad sample of 80 DEP-CI patients at NYSPI/Columbia University Medical Center (N = 40) and
      Duke University Medical Center (N = 40).  Recruitment will be from clinics and/or
      advertisements.  In the treatment protocol, all 80 DEP-CI patients will receive baseline
      mood and memory assessments and open antidepressant treatment with citalopram for 8 weeks.
      At 8 weeks, repeat assessment will occur and patients whose depression has responded to
      citalopram will be randomized to add-on donepezil or placebo.  Non-responders to citalopram
      will receive open treatment with venlafaxine and will be randomized 8 weeks later (16 weeks
      of open antidepressant treatment) to add-on donepezil or placebo.  Patients will be followed
      for a total period of 18 months with continuous open antidepressant treatment during the
      trial.

      Donepezil is being studied in order to increase the likelihood of obtaining a signal. If the
      results are positive, the investigators can begin clarifying the mechanism(s) in subsequent
      trials. Baseline apolipoprotein E e4 genotype, odor identification deficits, and MRI
      hippocampal and entorhinal cortex atrophy will be explored as predictors of donepezil
      response in the 18-month trial. Improving cognition and delaying conversion to a clinical
      diagnosis of dementia in this high risk group will enhance quality of life, reduce family
      burden, and markedly diminish overall health care costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly, the most common neuropsychiatric disorders are depression (DEP) and
      cognitive impairment (CI).  Their co-occurrence (DEP-CI) may exceed chance.  The lack of
      research in DEP-CI, the need to determine early prognostic indicators, and to develop
      optimal treatment strategies, was emphasized by a NIH consensus panel.  Since depression in
      patients with CI increases the risk of conversion to dementia, treatment strategies for
      DEP-CI have longer-term implications beyond acute antidepressant treatment response.
      However, in DEP-CI, there is a lack of data on treatment response of mood symptoms to
      antidepressant treatment and of cognitive deficits to cognitive enhancer treatment, and the
      long-term prognosis in these patients remains unclear.  The investigators have initial pilot
      data showing that donepezil was superior to placebo in improving memory performance in
      DEP-CI patients, and pilot data showing that patients with DEP-CI treated with combined
      escitalopram and memantine have a low conversion rate to dementia, primarily Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), over one year.  This proposal is for the first study to explicitly examine
      cognitive change, including conversion to dementia, in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled donepezil treatment trial in DEP-CI patients treated openly with
      antidepressants.  The investigators will conduct systematic follow-up to evaluate 18-month
      outcome.  In addition to apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype, the investigators will explore MRI
      hippocampal and entorhinal cortex atrophy and odor identification deficits as biomarkers
      that moderate response.

      This pilot trial will enroll about 80 DEP-CI patients who present to the departments of
      Psychiatry, Neurology and Internal Medicine at NYSPI/Columbia University and Duke University
      medical centers, ensuring broad representation for clinical relevance.  In the treatment
      protocol, all 80 DEP-CI patients will receive open antidepressant treatment with citalopram
      for 8 weeks.  At 8 weeks, citalopram responders will continue to be treated on citalopram,
      while non-responders will switch to venlafaxine treatment for an additional 8 weeks.  At 16
      weeks, all subjects will be randomized to add-on donepezil or placebo (N.B. Patients with a
      prior history of nonresponse to both citalopram and venlafaxine will be enrolled in the
      protocol and treated with bupropion and subsequently with doctor's choice of
      antidepressant).  Patients will be followed for a total period of up to 18 months in the
      trial, with antidepressant treatment adjusted as needed based on clinical response and side
      effects, i.e., open antidepressant treatment is continuous for all subjects throughout the
      trial and is not the experimental intervention.  The investigators chose to study
      antidepressant plus donepezil compared to placebo based on our pilot data and to increase
      the likelihood of obtaining a signal.

      Aim 1 (primary aim of the study).  To assess change in cognitive status over 18 months in
      antidepressant-treated DEP-CI patients comparing donepezil to placebo.

      Hypothesis 1.  Antidepressant-treated DEP-CI patients on donepezil will show a lower rate of
      conversion to dementia, primarily AD, compared to antidepressant-treated DEP-CI patients on
      placebo by the end of the 18-month trial.

      Hypothesis 2 (secondary).  Compared to the placebo group, the donepezil group will show
      better cognitive outcome by the end of the 18-month trial (SRT total recall: primary
      measure; modified ADAS-cog: secondary measure).

      Hypothesis 3 (secondary).  At the end of 24 weeks on add-on donepezil or placebo, the
      donepezil group will show better cognitive outcome than placebo (SRT total recall: primary
      measure; modified ADAS-cog: secondary measure).

      Aim 2:  To evaluate moderators of treatment on cognitive change in the 18-month
      donepezil-placebo trial, based on the view that patients with incipient AD brain pathology
      will have superior cognitive outcome on donepezil.  These Aim 2 hypotheses are considered
      exploratory.

      Hypothesis 1.  Patients with the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (homozygote or heterozygote),
      compared to patients without this allele, will have better cognitive outcome on donepezil
      compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis 2.  Lower scores on the UPSIT (odor identification test) at baseline will be
      associated with better cognitive outcome on donepezil compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis 3.  Smaller MRI hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes (atrophy) will be
      associated with better cognitive outcome on donepezil compared to placebo.

Dosing will be titrated up or down as necessary based on efficacy and side effects.   All patients over 60 will be kept at 20 mg or maximum tolerated dose, up to the 8-week point. At the end of the eighth week, we will assess all patients for antidepressant response.  At week 16, citalopram responders (those with a 50% reduction from baseline HAM-D) will be randomized to add-on donepezil or placebo.  Furthermore, if a patient does not respond to either Citalopram or Venlafaxine, the study physician may choose to treat the patient with an alternative antidepressant.</description>

          -  Presence of any of the following disorders: a) CNS infection, with CSF evidence of
             meningitis, encephalitis, or other infectious process; b) Post-traumatic dementia,
             defined as dementia with a clear temporal relationship to a severe head injury where
             consciousness was lost; c) Huntington's disease; d) Multiple sclerosis; e)
             Parkinson's disease; f) Other neurologic disorders with focal signs, e.g.,
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; g) Mental retardation.

          -  Contra-indication to MRI scan: pacemaker, metal implants following surgery, any other
             contraindication to MRI (e.g., ferromagnetic aneurysm clips, heart valves).  For
             patients with possible claustrophobia, they can do the MRI with adjunct lorazepam 0.5
             mg to reduce anxiety.  Patients who cannot do the MRI scan will still be eligible for
             the clinical trial, i.e., MRI is optional.
