Determine clinical response rates in patients with advanced melanoma treated with\n      gp100:209-217(210M) melanoma vaccine and low-dose interleukin-2.\n\n      II. Assess response duration and progression-free intervals in these patients receiving this\n      treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive gp100:209-217(210M) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on\n      day 1 and interleukin-2 SC on days 1-5 and 8-13. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence\n      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a complete response (CR)\n      receive 3 additional courses after achieving CR.\n\n      Patients are followed every 9 weeks for 3 years or until disease recurrence.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5\n      years."
