Determine overall survival in\n      these patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of raloxifene in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral raloxifene daily. Treatment continues indefinitely in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3\n      months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5\n      years."
