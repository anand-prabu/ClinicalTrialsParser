  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether LCS12 is associated with an increased risk of
      unintended pregnancy compared to Mirena and to copper IUDs. The objective is to assess among
      new users the risks of certain events (e.g. contraceptive failure rate, ectopic pregnancy,
      uterine perforation, and PID) associated with the use of LCS12 compared with the established
      hormonal IUD Mirena, and compared with established copper IUDs during standard clinical
      practice. In addition, drug utilization patterns will be described.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine contraceptive methods, such as Mirena and copper IUDs, have a high
      contraceptive efficacy. LCS12 is a new intrauterine system which, like Mirena, contains
      levonorgestrel (LNG), but the T-body dimensions and insertion tube diameter of LCS12 are
      smaller.

      Because there is a lack of comparative data between LCS12 and other intrauterine
      contraceptives, it is unclear whether there are differences in contraceptive failure rates
      between LCS12 and either Mirena or copper IUDs. In addition, any transcervical procedure,
      including the insertion of an intrauterine device, is potentially associated with the risk
      of infection/inflammation.

      EURAS-LCS12 is a prospective, controlled, non-interventional, active surveillance cohort
      study with three user cohorts: LCS12, Mirena and copper IUDs. Study participants will be
      recruited by a network of health care professionals and will be followed up through active
      surveillance to collect information regarding the outcomes of interest and major safety
      outcomes.

      All self-reported clinical outcomes of interest will be validated by health care
      professionals. The primary endpoint is unintended pregnancy. Secondary endpoints are ectopic
      pregnancy, uterine perforation, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
