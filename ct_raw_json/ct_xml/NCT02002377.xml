          2. Any scarring or fibrosis involving the center of the fovea

          3. Prior ocular or systemic treatment/surgery for wet AMD other than ranibizumab IVI
             monthly (in study eye)

          4. Prior prn or treat and extend treatment with ranibizumab IVI monthly between 3 to 9
