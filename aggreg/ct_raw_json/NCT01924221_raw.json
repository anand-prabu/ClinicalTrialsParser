Some patients achieve decrease in QRS\n      duration 6 months after cardiac resynchronization therapy. Such fenomenon is called reverse\n      electrical remodeling of native conduction. Retrospective analysis showed that reverse\n      electrical remodeling of the native conduction after at least 6 months of CRT is associated\n      with decreased rate of ventricular arrhythmias and better survival. This study is designed\n      to study  reverse electrical remodeling prospectively."
