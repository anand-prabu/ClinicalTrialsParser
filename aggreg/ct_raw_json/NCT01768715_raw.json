Complete agreement in the medical staff about the candidate to transplantation.\n\n        4. Absence of bacterial or fungal infection.\n\n      Three groups of patients will be formed:\n\n      Group 1. Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis and good response to therapy.

Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis and poor response to therapy, that are\n      candidates to transplantation.\n\n      A complete follow-up of the patients would be extended to five years. The survival of these\n      three groups will be compared. Survival of liver transplant recipients should also be\n      compared with survival of other liver transplant recipients.\n\n      Alcohol recidivism should also be studied in all the patients of the study. Sample size\n      estimation: According to the data published by Mathurin et al, 28 patients treated with\n      liver transplantation and 28 non-transplanted patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis\n      should be necessary.\n\n      Interim analysis after every 10 transplanted patients should be performed.
