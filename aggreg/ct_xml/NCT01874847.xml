      PURPOSE: The long-term goal of this line of research is to develop rational, biologically
      based evidence for the treatment of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) in children. The
      objective of this application is to examine the effect of melatonin on the symptoms of PCS
      and its neurobiology using integrated neurodiagnostic techniques in children.

      OVERVIEW: PCS is a constellation of clinical symptoms including physical (i.e. headaches),
      cognitive (i.e. memory), and behavioral disturbances. PCS is associated with significant
      morbidity in the child and his/her family), and yet there are no evidence-based medical
      treatments available. This suggests an urgent need to develop novel treatment options to
      improve outcomes for children suffering from PCS. Melatonin has several relevant mechanisms
      of action, and neuroprotective effects. Recent research suggests that the explanations for
      persistent PCS symptoms may be due to alterations in neurotransmissions and neuronal
      circuitry, particularly involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Investigators
      have two specific aims:

        1. To determine if treatment with melatonin improves PCS in children following mild
           traumatic brain injury. Hypothesis: treatment of mTBI children with PCS with 3mg or
           10mg of oral melatonin for 28 days will result in a decrease in PCS symptoms as
           compared with placebo. Effects will be dose-dependent and may be independent of sleep
           effects. Methods: A randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial (RCT); Outcome
           measure is a PCS symptom questionnaire. A subsequent RCT will then be performed using
           the optimal melatonin dose at a second centre.

        2. To understand the neurophysiological mechanisms of paediatric PCS and assess any
           resultant effects of treatment with melatonin. Methods: A case-controlled study within
           the RCT, using functional MRI and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to investigate the
           neurophysiological properties of paediatric mTBI before and after treatment; Treatment
           groups from the RCT will be compared with two control groups: i) normal controls and
           ii) asymptomatic mTBI children.

      SIGNIFICANCE: This study has the potential to 1) provide a safe and effective treatment for
      PCS and 2) will provide valuable information about the neurophysiological properties of the
      brain associated with PCS following mTBI in children and how these change with symptom
      resolution.

    <description>The PCSI is a standardized questionnaire of 26 symptoms provides an overall rating of Post concussion symptoms. It has four specific domains: physical (including headaches), cognitive, emotional (including mood) and fatigue and high level of internal consistency, alpha=0.92. Parent and youth PCSI scores correlate. Low symptom rates are found in normative samples. The version for youth will also be recorded (PCSI-Y). Change in PCSI scores allows us to account for baseline variability and gender.</description>

    <description>BASC-2 is a standardized parent report measure of child behavior consisting of 150 items. It provides an indication of internalizing and externalizing behaviour (e.g., anxiety, depression). Items are rated using true-false, or a 4-point ordinal scale.
The internal consistency for the composite subscales range from .87 to .96 and test-retest reliability is high, ranging from .81 to .96 (10-20 minutes) (</description>
