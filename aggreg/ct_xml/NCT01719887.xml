  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humeral shaft fractures represent 1-3% of all fractures and 20% of the humeral fractures.
      These fractures have historically been treated mainly conservatively with good results.
      Recent development in fracture treatment and findings that certain fracture types are more
      prone to non-union and bracing-related functional problems of adjacent joints are somewhat
      common have caused increasing interest in treating these fractures surgically. Return to
      activities is also considered to be quicker among surgically treated patients.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surgical
      treatment of humeral shaft fractures. Patients with an unilateral humeral shaft fracture who
      are willing to participate in the study after informed consent are randomly assigned to two
      different treatment methods:

        1. Surgical treatment with an open reduction and internal fixation with a 4,5mm locking
           plate.

        2. Conservative treatment with functional bracing

      The randomization is done using blocked randomization (block sizes are not known by the
      enrolling or assigning phycisian) and stratification is done according to fracture type
      (AO-OTA type A vs. type B/C) and radial nerve status (total/subtotal motor palsy vs. no
      palsy).

      Standard follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months are arranged. Later follow-up
      visits are arranged at 2, 5 and 10 years for the study purpose. Patients fill evaluation
      forms and clinical and radiological assessments are made. The physiotherapist doing
      objective functional measurements is blinded to treatment method. Both study groups receive
      physiotherapy after the initial treatment.
