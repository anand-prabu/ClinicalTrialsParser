Fracture increases costs of care, dependency.\n\n      Bone fragility is secondary to hormonal disorders and calcium phosphate, impaired excretion\n      of neuropeptides, vasomotor symptoms associated with the asset that promote bone loss and\n      architectural disorganization. These phenomena occur in the first weeks of development of\n      spinal cord injury and predominate in the distal femur and proximal tibia. From the third\n      year, the demineralization stabilizes, bone mass is estimated to be between 70 and 50% of\n      the initial bone mass, the new equilibrium.\n\n      No clinical evidence is predictive of fracture risk. A criteria surrogate must be used to\n      assess this risk. There is an association between bone mineral density and fracture risk.\n      The fracture threshold knee was evaluated to 0.87 g/cm2. Evaluation of bone mineral density\n      in the distal femur is a predictor of fracture risk. Measure reliable and reproducible, easy\n      to perform, it is a good element for monitoring the efficacy of anti-resorptive therapy."
