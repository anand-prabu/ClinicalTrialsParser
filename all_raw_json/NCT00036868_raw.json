Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them\n      or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining\n      chemotherapy with trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining combination chemotherapy\n      with trastuzumab in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer."

Patients also receive trastuzumab\n      (Herceptin\u00ae) IV over 30-90 minutes once weekly beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4\n      weeks for 8 courses. Patients then receive trastuzumab once every 3 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until documentation of disease progression or initiation\n      of a new anticancer therapy. Patients developing disease progression are followed every 12\n      weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
