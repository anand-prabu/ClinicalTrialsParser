Specifically, examine the\n           potential association between maternal SSRI use and the fetal QT interval,and;\n\n        3. develop the capacity to measure uterine contractions during labor using non-invasive\n           electrodes that measure the electrical signal from the uterine muscle.\n\n      For this study, the investigational device will not be used to diagnose or treat as it will\n      be used in concert with the current standard of care monitors."
