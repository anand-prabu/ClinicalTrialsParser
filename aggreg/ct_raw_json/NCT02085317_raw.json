Images were recorded for 10 seconds at each point and evaluated afterwards using\n      Cap-Image v7.2software.\n\n      Evaluation with laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF):\n\n      Skin blood perfusion was measured in conventional perfusion units (PU) by means of a LDF\n      apparatus (Periflux PF4, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden), equipped with a non-heated probe\n      (PF408), fixed to the medial surface of the right forearm. Laser characteristics were: 780\n      nm wavelength, 10-19 kHz bandwidth, 0.1 s time constant and 32 Hz sampling frequency. Skin\n      blood perfusion was expressed in conventional perfusion units (PU: 1 PU=10 mV) and  LD\n      signal was recorded continuously by an interfaced computer (Sony VaioVGN-CR160A) equipped\n      with Perisoft dedicated software. Exams were performed in two steps:\n\n      First, to register  vasomotion, a probe (Probe 481-1: Single Iontophoresis Probe - Perimed,\n      Stockholm, Sweden) was placed, after the skin was cleaned with a wipe of 70\u00b0 alcohol and\n      left to air dry, in the dorsal face of the distal phalanx of the 2nd finger. The probes were\n      positioned at least 10 cm apart, avoiding superficial veins and broken skin areas. This\n      probe may be used for both  vasomotion and  iontophoresis. Basal blood perfusion was\n      continuously recorded during 20 min. Skin temperature was continuously measured.\n\n      To   avoid  residual effects of previously used drugs, the probe position for combined\n      iontophoresis and LDF recordings were placed in untreated fingers [2nd   for acetylcholine\n      (Ach) and 3nd  for sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] after each measurement .\n\n      Using a protocol similar to the one developed by Rossi and co-workers (Rossi et al., 2008),\n      ACh  (Acetylcholine - Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was  delivered by 9 iontophoretic\n      pulses of 0.1 mA for 20 s with 60 s interval between pulses using a drug delivery electrode\n      filled with 0.1 ml of 1% ACh solution, attached to the dorsal aspect of the second left\n      finger by a double-sided adhesive disc.   After Ach,  SNP (Nipride\u00ae 10mg/ml - Biolab, S\u00e3o\n      Paulo, Brazil) was delivered by 7 iontophoretic pulses of 0.2 mA for 20 s with  180 s\n      interval between pulses using another drug delivery electrode filled with 0.1 ml of 1% SNP\n      solution,  attached to the dorsal aspect of the third left finger. In both situations, an\n      indifferent electrode was attached on the dorsal aspect of the left hand.\n      Endothelial-dependent and independent skin vasodilator response to each iontophoresis pulse\n      was measured in PUs, as mean value during each interval from one pulse to the following one."
