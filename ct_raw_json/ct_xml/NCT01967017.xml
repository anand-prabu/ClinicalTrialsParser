  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the high efficacy of intrauterine devices (IUDs), some women choose not to receive
      IUDs secondary to the pain associated with insertion. Nulliparous women may be especially
      susceptible to procedure-related pain from IUD insertion. This study will investigate the
      difference in perceived pain from IUD insertion, comparing local anesthesia to a placebo,
      among women who have not had a vaginal delivery before. The investigators anticipate that
      among women who have not had a previous vaginal delivery, the pain associated with IUD
      insertion will be significantly decreased after administration of local anesthesia.

      The study will investigate the difference in perceived pain from IUD insertion, comparing
      paracervical block with lidocaine to a placebo (bacteriostatic saline) block, among
      nulliparous and &quot;functionally nulliparous&quot; women. The investigators plan a double-masked,
      placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial. The investigators anticipate that among
      patients who have not had a previous vaginal delivery, the pain associated with IUD
      insertion will be significantly decreased after administration of a 15 mL 1% lidocaine
      paracervical block compared to patients who receive 15 mL of bacteriostatic saline
      (placebo).
