  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use tissue or body fluid acquired during standard procedures that are part
      of the patient's care for their cancer, such as surgery to remove tumor tissue or needle
      withdrawal of body fluid containing cancer cells.  The tissue or cells will be injected into
      immune compromised mice and the tissue will be allowed to grow to a tumor 1-1.5 cm size. The
      tissue will then be extracted and either frozen, embedded in paraffin, or used for
      engraftment into another generation of mice. The second generation mice will be separated
      into groups and given various treatments.

      Tissue from the participants and from the mouse established tumors, in which the mice have
      either received treatment or have not received treatment, will be used to evaluate the
      levels of various genes that assist in regulating cell growth and cell death.  The tumor
      tissue from participants and mice will also be tested for random changes in the genetic
      material and compared to the participant's blood to determine if any of the changes in the
      genetic material correlate with better engraftment of the patient tissue in the mice. It is
      anticipated that 10-30% will have successful engraftment of tumor tissue

    <description>Thirty-five patients with breast cancer will be recruited.  We anticipate that 10-30% will have successful engraftment of tumor tissue.  The achievement of five successful xenografts would justify additional study.</description>

    <description>The rate of tumor growth will be calculated.  Mice are monitored three times per week for general health and tumor length.  Tumor length Tumor length and width are measured with calipers and recorded. Tumor volume will be calculated with the formula (Length x Width x Width)/2, derived from the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid. Tumor growth will be measured at each time point by calculating the ratio of tumor volume (V) to the initial tumor volume (Vo). Average time, measured in weeks, required for tumors to form palpable masses in F1 mice will be recorded as the Time-until-Tumor-Formation (TTF). A comparison of TTF between tumor cells isolated from tumor tissue isolated by surgical biopsy, and by malignant cells in a body fluid will be compared</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Women &gt; age 18. with a history of ER+. HER-2 negative breast cancer previously
             treated with adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor? for at
             least 1 year after surgical resection of primary tumor.

          -  ER+ status requires positive staining in &gt; 10% of malignant cells in biopsy specimen.

          -  HER-2 Negative status requires Immunohistochemistry 0-1+, or with a FISH ratio of &lt;
             2.0 if IHC is 2+ or if IHC has not been done.

          -  Patient must have: A. newly diagnosed recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic
             breast cancer. B. existing advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

          -  Patient must be having clinically indicated: A. diagnostic tumor biopsy via core-or
             needle incision or B. surgical removal of tumor or C. collection of pleural or
             ascetic fluid in order to obtain fresh tumor tissue for research (transplant into
             mice).

          -  For subjects having a diagnostic tumor biopsy, excess fresh tumor tissue must be
             available from the biopsy for research for immediate transplantation into mice.

          -  For subjects having a surgical resection of the primary tumor, the tumor must have a
             clinical size of 1 cm or greater, and and excess fresh tumor tissue must be available
             from the surgical specimen for research for immediate transplantation into mice.

          -  Ability to give signed informed consent
