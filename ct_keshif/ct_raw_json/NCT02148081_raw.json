Once these children leave the pediatric intensive care unit, very little is\n      known about what happens to them - how long it takes for them to recover, how families cope,\n      and what factors that impede their recovery. The specific objective of this research project\n      is to evaluate how children and their families recover after a critical illness.\n\n      Research Hypotheses: Following a critical illness in children, 1) the rate and degree of\n      health and functional recovery is influenced by the following factors: age, pre-admission\n      co-morbid status, critical illness severity, discharge functional status, and time to\n      initiating acute rehabilitation; 2) functional recovery is influenced by caregiver burden\n      and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL)."
