            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were\n      destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells are\n      rejected by the body's normal tissues. Cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate,\n      and tacrolimus may prevent this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of fludarabine plus\n      total-body irradiation with that of combination chemotherapy followed by donor peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or\n      chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

Patients are stratified according to\n      disease, age (less than 55 vs over 55), and participating transplantation center. Patients\n      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -4 to -2. Patients undergo total body\n           irradiation followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT)\n           on day 0. Patients receive graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprising oral\n           cyclosporine twice daily on days -2 to 90 followed by a taper on days 90-150 and oral\n           mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days 0-28.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide IV on\n           days -3 to -2. Patients undergo PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis\n           comprising methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and tacrolimus IV continuously and\n           then orally on days -2 to 90 followed by a taper on days 90-150.\n\n      At approximately day 180, patients with persistent disease, evidence of T-cell chimerism,\n      and no GVHD may receive up to 3 donor lymphocyte infusions administered every 1-2 months.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every\n      6 months for 1 year.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
