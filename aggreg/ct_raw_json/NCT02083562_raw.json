After informed consent a sample\n      of 0.5 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) full blood will be taken on day 7 of life\n      (+/- 2 days) during routine blood sampling. The biomarkers which are planned to measure\n      include  the C-terminal portion of the proendothelin-1 precursor (CT-proendothelin\n      (proET)-1) and other plasma biomarkers of respiratory distress. At 36 weeks PMA, lung\n      function testing will be performed during quiet unsedated sleep in supine position\n      approximately 30 minutes post feeding. After placement of a facemask, tidal breathing will\n      be recorded at the bedside using a commercially available ultrasonic flow meter (Spiroson,\n      Exhalyzer D, Ecomedics, CH) according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European\n      Respiratory Society (ERS) standards of infant lung function testing. Different capnographic\n      indices will be calculated  to investigate if they reflect the degree of lung disease at 36\n      weeks PMA."
