It is not yet known whether fenretinide given before surgery is more\n      effective in preventing ovarian cancer than surgery alone.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of fenretinide followed by\n      surgery with that of surgery alone in preventing ovarian cancer in patients who are at\n      increased risk."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo prophylactic oophorectomy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral fenretinide once daily for 27 days every 30 days for 6-8\n           weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of\n           malignancy. After completion of fenretinide, patients undergo prophylactic\n           oophorectomy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
