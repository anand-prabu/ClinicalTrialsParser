A\n      large group of patients with severe heart failure and classified in NYHA Class III and IV,\n      deselect the offer because of lack of energy to participate in cardiac rehabilitation or is\n      when specified by a medical assessment discharged from the hospital without the offer of\n      training or any other form of rehabilitation.\n\n      The offer of rehabilitation for patients with severe heart failure is lacking as it is\n      today. This study assesses the effectiveness of an early home based rehabilitation program\n      that complements the general psycho-social support, symptom-oriented and preventive medical\n      treatment that these patients always have the option to get."
