  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate steady-state cobalt levels following dietary
      supplementation for 90 days with 1 mg cobalt/day (as cobalt chloride in solution) in healthy
      adult volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Over the counter cobalt (Co) dietary supplements are available for sale in the United
      States, but little is known regarding their clinical effects and biokinetic distribution and
      body burden with long-term use. This study assessed blood kinetics, steady-state levels,
      biochemical responses, and clinical effects in five adult males and five adult females who
      voluntarily ingested approximately 1.0 mg Co/day of a commercially available Co supplement
      over a three month period. Volunteers were instructed to take the Co-dietary supplement in
      the morning according to the manufacturer's label. Blood samples were collected and analyzed
      for a number of biochemical parameters before, during, and after dosing. Hearing, vision,
      cardiac, and neurological functions were also assessed in volunteers before, during, and
      after dosing.

    <description>The cobalt concentration in whole blood and serum was determined one to two weeks pre-dosing and on the day of the first dose before taking the supplement. Samples were also analyzed during the dosing period as follows: Day 4/5, Day 8/9, Day 14/16, Day 22/23, Day 29/30, Day 43/44, Day 57/58, Day 71/72, Day 88/90. Cobalt concentration in whole blood and serum was also determined at one, two, six, ten and 16 weeks post-dosing. A 24-hr urine collection for cobalt analysis was performed at Day 14/16, Day 43/44, and Day 88/90. In addition, three volunteers (two females and one male) collected 24-hr urine samples for cobalt analysis at one, two, six, and ten weeks post-dosing.</description>

    <description>Blood chemistries assessed during the study included a lipid panel, comprehensive metabolic panel, creatine kinase-myocardial band, thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and complete blood count with differential, total iron, and ferritin. Blood chemistries were assessed at one or two week pre-dose, pre-dose/ Day 1 before taking the supplement, Day 14/16, Day 29/30, Day 57/58, Day 88/90 and one and two weeks post-dose.</description>

    <description>Audiologic assessments including pure tone threshold determination at frequencies ranging from 250 to 16000 Hz were performed with volunteers serving as their own baseline controls for receptive changes during the study (i.e., week 0, ~day 45, ~day 90).</description>

    <description>Ophthalmology studies included an assessment of visual acuity, slit lamp evaluations, and visual field testing. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and optic nerve head (ONH) were assessed using optical coherence tomography (OCT).
