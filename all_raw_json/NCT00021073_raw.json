Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol, fluorouracil, and leucovorin\n      calcium with or without irinotecan in patients with advanced malignancy.\n\n      II. Assess the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. III. Determine the\n      clinical response in patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This a dose-escalation study of flavopiridol (FLAVO), fluorouracil (5-FU), and\n      irinotecan. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Groups I and II are conducted\n      sequentially.\n\n      Group I: Patients receive FLAVO IV over 24 hours on day 1 and leucovorin calcium (CF) IV and\n      5-FU IV over 1.5 hours daily on days 2-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating\n      doses of FLAVO and 5-FU until the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) are determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Group II: Once the MTDs for FLAVO and 5-FU are determined, patients receive FLAVO, CF, and\n      5-FU as in group I plus irinotecan IV over 1.5 hours on day 1. Courses repeat as in group I.\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the MTD is determined.\n      The MTD is defined as in group I.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 57-90 patients will be accrued for this study within 18\n      months."
