    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test two study drugs, one of which is temazepam (15mg) and
      one of which is a placebo (an inactive substance that looks just like the temazepam), to see
      if insomnia (trouble sleeping) can be reduced in patients with HIV infection.  Placebos are
      given in research studies to try and make sure that subjects are responding to the effects
      of the study drug and not to other factors, like the attention they are receiving.  If you
      decide to take part in this study, you will take 1 capsule of study drug every night
      approximately 30 minutes before bedtime for approximately 12 weeks.

      This study is to test the study drug called temazepam for the treatment of insomnia (trouble
      sleeping) in patients with HIV infection.  Temazepam has been approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of insomnia. However, because this study requires treatment for 12 weeks instead
      of the 7 to 10 days approved by the FDA, the use of temazepam is considered to be
      investigational in this study.
