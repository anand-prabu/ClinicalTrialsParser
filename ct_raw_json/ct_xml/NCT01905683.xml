  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of Botulinum toxin type A into
      muscles of the leg(s) or of leg(s) and one arm are safe in treating children/adolescents
      (age 2-17 years) long-term with increased muscle tension/uncontrollable muscle stiffness
      (spasticity) due to cerebral palsy.

    <description>The AS is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Global Impression of Change Scales (GICS) are global outcomes to assess the impression of change due to treatment. GICS will be assessed by the  investigator, by the subject (if feasible) and by parents'/caregiver (if applicable). GICS are 7-Point Likert Scales ranging from +3 (very much improved) to -3 (very much worse).</description>
