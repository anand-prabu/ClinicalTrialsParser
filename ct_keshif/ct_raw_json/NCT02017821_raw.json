After completion of various physical tests, an 8 week period of\n      high intensity aerobic training intervention will follow. It will be investigated if the SUD\n      patients are able to engage and participate throughout the whole training intervention, to\n      what degree the participants improve their physical health and the effect of physical health\n      improvement on substance abuse treatment."
