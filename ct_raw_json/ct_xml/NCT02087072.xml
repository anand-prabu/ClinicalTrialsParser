  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to develop a sustainable practice model emphasizing home visits by
      a collaborative physician and pharmacist team to decrease unplanned emergency department
      visits and hospital readmissions at 30 and 90 days for high-risk home bound patients.
      Secondary objectives include (1) tracking the number, type, and severity of adverse drug
      events (ADE) and potential adverse drug events (pADE) that occur following hospital
      discharge and (2) resolving any identified ADE and pADE within 7 days of hospital discharge.

      Adult patients will be scheduled for a home visit by the Healthy at Home Columbus program at
      the time of hospital discharge. The home visit will occur within 7 days of hospital
      discharge and will consist of a complete hospital and medication review by a physician or
      nurse practitioner and a pharmacist (including all lab tests, imaging studies, medication
      changes, and proposed plan of care at the time of discharge). The investigators hypothesize
      these home visits will reduce 30 and 90 days hospital readmission rates and ED visits.

      The number of emergency department visits and unplanned hospital readmissions will be
      tracked at 30 and 90 days following discharge from the hospitalization that led to study
      enrollment. A comparison cohort of patients discharged in the 12 months prior to study
      initiation will be used to compare the effectiveness of the home visit program. The number
      and type of adverse drug events (ADE) and potential adverse drug events (pADE) that occur
      during transitions of care will also be characterized. All ADE and pADE will be resolved
      during the initial home visit and will be classified based on severity.  All ADE and pADE
      will be evaluated independently by two pharmacist reviewers; each reviewer will
      independently assign a severity rating to each ADE and pADE.
