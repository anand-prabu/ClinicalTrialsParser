  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complete endoscopic resection of early neoplastic BE is a curative procedure. However, a
      significant proportion of patients develop symptomatic esophageal strictures following CBE,
      and this limits the technique, particularly for circumferential and longer segment disease.
      Oral steroid therapy may reduce stricture formation; thereby allowing CBE to be performed
      with minimal associated morbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed randomized trial is to compare the rate of symptomatic
      oesophageal strictures in patients receiving placebo versus oral prednisone.

    <description>Daily oral prednisone is taken for 6 weeks, at a dose of 40mg/day in week 1, 30mg/day in week 2, 20mg/day week 3 and 4, 10mg/day in week 5, and 5mg/day in week 6.  Prednisone is taken in the morning.  Treatment commences the day of the procedure, with the dose taken with a sip of water prior to discharge.  The 6-week treatment regimen is given after both the 1st and 2nd stage complete Barretts excision.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed Barretts mucosa with HGD or early EAC (T1a, intramucosal
             adenocarcinoma).

          2. Barretts segment ≥ 30% circumference, ≤C3 and ≤M5.

          3. The general health condition of the patient permits anesthesia for endoscopy.

          4. Patient is 18 years of age or older.

          5. Informed consent is obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous (referral) biopsies show low grade dysplasia only, or invasive
             adenocarcinoma.

          2. Barretts segment &lt;30% circumference, &gt;C3 or &gt;M5.

          3. During initial gastroscopy there are highly suspicious areas for submucosal invasive
             cancer (Kudo pit pattern type V; excavated/depressed type morphology; large smooth or
             ulcerated nodule). In cases of significant doubt, initial resection is of the highly
             suspicious area only, and urgent histology processing requested. If submucosal
             invasion is excluded, the patient is rebooked for 1st stage CBE (60% circumferential
             resection) and randomization after a 4-6 weeks interval.

          4. Presence of a tight peptic oesophageal stricture that impedes safe and effective EMR
             using the DuetteTM cap (Cook Medical).

          5. Active malignancy, uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus, active or untreated major
             psychiatric disorder, uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled
             or severe congestive cardiac failure, non-correctable coagulopathy (INR&gt;2, or
             platelet count &lt;60 x 109/L), osteoporosis, recent peptic ulcer disease,
             moderate-to-severe glaucoma or untreated glaucoma, or pregnancy.

          6. Unable to provide informed consent

          7. Allergy to compound used in tablet formulation
