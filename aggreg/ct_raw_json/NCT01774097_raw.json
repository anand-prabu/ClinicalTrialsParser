            "textblock": "Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) occurs when arteries in the arms and legs (most often the\n      legs) become narrowed by plaque. Because of this plaque, patients with PAD are also at\n      increased risk for heart attacks and strokes.  Those with PAD often have intermittent\n      claudication (blockage of blood vessels in the leg). This blockage decreases blood flow to\n      the leg muscles, which can cause pain in one or both legs during exercise (such as during\n      walking).  Intermittent means the pain comes and goes.  Because PAD interferes with\n      circulation, worsening of this condition can increase pain in the leg; sometimes even during\n      periods of rest.\n\n      Bone marrow contains special stem cells that may promote blood vessel growth, prevent cell\n      death, and transform themselves into a number of tissues including new muscle. There is a\n      small subpopulation of bone marrow mononuclear cells, called aldehyde dehydrogenase-bright\n      (ALDHbr) cells, that is highly enriched in these types of stem cells.  The enzyme in ALDHbr\n      cells responds to damage signals and may play an important role in tissue repair.\n\n      In this study we investigate the safety and efficacy of bone marrow derived stem cells with\n      particular characteristics in PAD patients with intermittent claudication and explore new\n      end-points to evaluate therapeutic effects using novel MRI imaging modalities as well as\n      traditional endpoints."
