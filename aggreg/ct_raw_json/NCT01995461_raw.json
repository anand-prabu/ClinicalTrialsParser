            "textblock": "The most common forms of injection used for the treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal\n      stenosis (DLSS) patients with neurogenic claudication (NC) are the caudal and inter-laminar\n      epidural injections of anesthetic and steroid.  Unilateral transforaminal epidural steroid\n      injections (TESI) are also used to alleviate patients' symptoms of NC from DLSS,\n      particularly in patients whose level of stenosis is L4-5 or higher.  However, these\n      unilateral injections do not cross the midline, so in cases of lower extremity pain and\n      symptoms on both sides, a bilateral TESI would probably be more beneficial.\n\n      To date, there have not been any well designed prospective studies to determine the\n      effectiveness of bilateral TESI below the level of stenosis in DLSS patients with NC.\n      Therefore, the goal of this prospective, non-randomized case-series outcome study is to\n      evaluate the effectiveness of BTESI in alleviating symptoms of NC, as well as improving\n      function in patients with DLSS.  The hypothesis is that BTESI at the level below the most\n      stenotic segment of the central canal of the lumbar spine decreases symptoms of NC and\n      improves function in patients with DLSS."
