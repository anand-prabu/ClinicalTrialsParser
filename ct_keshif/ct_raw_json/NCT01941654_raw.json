Not more than 4 residual metabolic active (SUVmax > 2.5) metastatic sites left on the\n             screening PET-CT scan. (one bone metastatic site is regarded as a single site,\n             mediastinal/ hilar lymph nodes in close proximity and possible to be treated in an\n             acceptable volume is regarded as one lesion)\n\n          5.

Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:\n\n               1. Serum alanine transaminase \u2264 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or \u2264 5 x ULN if\n                  liver function abnormalities are due to liver metastases\n\n               2. Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n\n               3. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1.5 x 109/L\n\n               4. Platelets count \u2265 100 x 109/L\n\n               5.

Prior chemotherapy is not allowed except adjuvant chemotherapy for completely\n             resected early staged non-small cell lung cancer and it has been at least 12 months\n             before the start of EGFR TKI treatment\n\n          2. Prior radiotherapy is not allowed except brain irradiation\n\n          3. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\n\n          4. Lymphangitis carcinomatosis of lung\n\n          5. Prior or concomitant malignancy at other sites is not allowed except treated\n             non-metastatic non-melanoma skin cancer, ductal carcinoma-in-situ of breast and\n             carcinoma-in-situ of cervix with curative intent\n\n          6. Uncontrolled active infection or medical condition (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension,\n             unstable angina, congestive heart failure [\u2265 NYHA Class II], uncontrolled arrhythmia,\n             myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident  within the past 6 month)\n\n          7. Pre-existing interstitial lung disease\n\n          8. Woman of child-bearing potential or male patient is unwilling to use adequate birth\n             control method prior to the study entry, for the duration of study participation and\n             for at least 2 months after the EGFR TKI treatment has ended.\n\n          9.
