The home visit will occur within 7 days of hospital\n      discharge and will consist of a complete hospital and medication review by a physician or\n      nurse practitioner and a pharmacist (including all lab tests, imaging studies, medication\n      changes, and proposed plan of care at the time of discharge). The investigators hypothesize\n      these home visits will reduce 30 and 90 days hospital readmission rates and ED visits.\n\n      The number of emergency department visits and unplanned hospital readmissions will be\n      tracked at 30 and 90 days following discharge from the hospitalization that led to study\n      enrollment. A comparison cohort of patients discharged in the 12 months prior to study\n      initiation will be used to compare the effectiveness of the home visit program. The number\n      and type of adverse drug events (ADE) and potential adverse drug events (pADE) that occur\n      during transitions of care will also be characterized. All ADE and pADE will be resolved\n      during the initial home visit and will be classified based on severity.  All ADE and pADE\n      will be evaluated independently by two pharmacist reviewers; each reviewer will\n      independently assign a severity rating to each ADE and pADE."
