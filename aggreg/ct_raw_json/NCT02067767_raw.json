However this regimen comprises 2 pills per day.\n      Abacavir/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG) offers simplification with a single pill per\n      day with no food constraints, Dolutegravir (DTG) having the advantage over Nevirapine (NVP)\n      of high potency, higher genetic barrier to resistance, with a very good safety profile. The\n      objective of this study is to evaluate the virologic safety (maintenance of virologic\n      suppression) after switching from ABC/3TC + NVP to ABC/3TC/DTG in 50 HIV-1 infected adults\n      with prolonged HIV RNA suppression on ABC/3TC + NVP, as well as clinical and laboratory\n      safety. Because nevirapine is a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes, pharmacocinetic (PK)\n      assessment will be performed in all patients in the first weeks after switch and 24-hours PK\n      in a subset of 10 patients after 5 days of DTG addition to current regimen, before switching\n      to ABC/3TC/DTG."
