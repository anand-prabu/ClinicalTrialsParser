  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and undertreated condition in patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both physiologic and empiric data suggest that renal hypoxia
      due to OSA is associated with worsening kidney function. Hospitalized patients are often
      exposed to multiple nephrotoxins such as antibiotics, contrast agents, and diuretics, which
      place them at risk for acute worsening of kidney function. This study aims to determine
      whether immediate diagnosis and treatment of OSA in CKD patients will decrease the incidence
      of acute kidney injury during hospitalization. The investigators will evaluate the extent to
      which this effect can be attributed to a decrease in nocturnal hypoxia and improved blood
      pressure control. Secondary endpoints include hospital length of stay, and a composite
      outcome comprised of hemodialysis initiation, major cardiovascular events, and mortality.
