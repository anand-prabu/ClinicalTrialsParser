The educational\n      intervention will focus on the medical management of pediatric obesity, the use of Body Mass\n      Index charts, and information about how obese children would like to be approached by their\n      physicians.  The behavioural intervention will incorporate Motivational Interviewing tools\n      in addition to an abbreviated training program received by the educational intervention\n      group."

            "textblock": "There are no prospective, randomized clinical studies on training physicians to effectively\n      manage pediatric obesity using both Motivational Interviewing (MI) tools and advice from\n      overweight children. A novel aspect of this study is that the skills taught during the\n      trainings are made so that physician can easily incorporate them into their busy practice.\n      The generated findings from focus groups with obese children, merged guidelines for the\n      medical management of childhood obesity, and training in specific MI tools, also make this\n      study unique. Primary Objective:\n\n      To determine which of two interventions (behavioural/education) is most effective in\n      increasing discussion initiation around weight with overweight children by calculating,\n      plotting, and tracking BMI, and increasing self-reported efficacy in counseling overweight\n      pediatric patients. HYPOTHESIS: The behaviour change intervention will be most effective\n      because it will achieve greater changes in the above mentioned behaviours that are\n      maintained for 6 to 12 months.  These outcomes will be influenced by counselling efficacy,\n      frequency, and type of reported barriers and not physician demographics.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n      To evaluate current physician practices of BMI calculating, plotting and/or tracking, and\n      discussion initiation with overweight pediatric patients, and the factors that influence\n      these behaviours. HYPOTHESIS: Physicians do not consistently calculate, plot, and/or track\n      BMI and/or discuss weight with their pediatric patients.  These practices will be primarily\n      influenced by physicians' characteristics, counselling efficacy, frequency and type of\n      reported barriers"

This intervention will attempt to demonstrate that BMI calculating, plotting and tracking are useful diagnostic monitoring tools and that their actions may lead to more effective prevention and/or treatment.\nThe education intervention will not prescribe specific discussion initiation tools, although the participants will not be prevented from independently changing their communication behaviour.",

This study generated suggestions of how physicians can encourage children to think positively about making changes towards a healthier body weight. This intervention is designed to address physicians' lack of self-efficacy in communicating with children and their families about achieving a healthy body weight, and therefore would likely benefit from the input from children and the patient-centred theme of MI.  It is based on the Trans-Theoretical Model and Stages of Change which postulates that people follow a step-wise progression towards change with specific constructs that need to be addressed before moving to the next step. These constructs are integral to the principles of MI",
