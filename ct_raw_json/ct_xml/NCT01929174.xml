  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to measure the relaxation of the heart in subjects with
      single ventricles who have undergone the surgical Fontan procedure.  We will do this by
      measuring relaxation with MRI, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization and compare to
      blood levels that measure heart scarring.  We will also measure relaxation before and after
      boluses of intravenous (IV) fluids to see if the relaxation changes when there is more fluid
      in the heart.  Measurements of heart relaxation will be obtained from the MRI,
      echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization for each patient and compared to blood markers
      of heart scarring.  We aim to compare all of these measurements to see if we can accurately
      identify heart scarring and, if present, how much it correlates with impaired heart
      relaxation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria: adult patients (age â‰¥18) with a previous Fontan procedure (including
        all variants) referred for catheterization.  This includes individuals with tricuspid
        atresia, double inlet left ventricle, unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect, and
        pulmonary atresia with intact septum.  Control subjects will be selected from individuals
        referred to the lab for evaluation/closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO).  All subjects
        must be willing to participate in all portions of the study and provide written informed
        consent.

        Exclusion criteria:  contraindications to MRI such as ferromagnetic objects in the chest,
        claustrophobia, or contraindication to gadolinium contrast (estimated creatinine clearance
        &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2).  Fontan patients with a morphologic right ventricle (namely
        hypoplastic left heart after a Norwood palliation) will be excluded, because of the
        disproportionate risk of systolic dysfunction in the morphologic right ventricle.33
        Control patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, or reduced systolic
        function will be excluded.
