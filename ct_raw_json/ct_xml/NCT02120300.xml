    <textblock>
      This study will determine the HCV antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment
      with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) for participants with
      genotypes 1 and 4 HCV infection and Sofosbuvir (SOF) + Ribavirin (RBV) for participants with
      genotypes 2 and 3 HCV infection. Participants with an inherited bleeding disorder and
      chronic HCV infection (either monoinfected or HIV-1/HCV coinfected) will be enrolled.
