            "textblock": "We hypothesize that administration of LDE-225 in humans with pancreatic cancer will result\n      in inhibition of paracrine HH signaling in the pancreatic tumor stroma while having no\n      effect on autocrine signaling in the tumor cell compartment.  Furthermore we hypothesize\n      that treatment with LDE-225 will result in changes in the tumor stroma (decreased\n      desmoplasia, increased vascularity) that will result in improved tumor blood flow.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if, where and how LDE-225 works in pancreatic\n      cancer.  A cancer cell's growth can depend on the cells and tissue around it. The cells and\n      tissue make chemical signals to influence the cancer's growth. This research study is\n      evaluating LDE-225 designed to interfere with one of the growth signals causing pancreatic\n      cancer growth."
