(Calculations will be made using\n             measurements from both posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries as well as both\n             arms).\n\n          3. Have venous leg ulcer extending through the full thickness of the skin but not down\n             to muscle, tendon or bone. The largest ulcer will be designated the index ulcer and\n             the only one included in the study. If other ulcerations are present on the same\n             extremity, these must be more than 2 cm apart from the index ulcer.\n\n          4. Have venous insufficiency confirmed by duplex ultrasound examination for valvular or\n             venous incompetence.\n\n          5. Have study ulcer (i.e. current episode of ulceration) that has been present for at\n             least one month prior to the initial screening visit. Note: The patient is excluded\n             if ulcer has undergone 12 months of continuous high strength compression therapy over\n             its duration.\n\n          6. Have study ulcer with a minimum of 2 cm2 and a maximum of 25 cm2 at the randomization\n             visit.\n\n          7. The target ulcer has been treated with compression therapy for at least 14 days prior\n             to randomization.\n\n          8. Ulcer has a clean, granulating base with minimal adherent slough at the randomization\n             visit.\n\n          9. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of\n             contraception (birth control pills, barriers, or abstinence).\n\n         10. Patient understands and is willing to comply with weekly visits and the follow-up\n             regimen.\n\n         11. Patient has read and signed the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed\n             Consent Form before screening procedures are undertaken.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Study ulcer(s) deemed by the investigator to be caused by a medical condition other\n             than venous insufficiency.\n\n          2. Study ulcer exhibits clinical signs and symptoms of infection.\n\n          3. Study ulcer, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer should\n             undergo an ulcer biopsy to rule out a carcinoma.\n\n          4. Patients with a history of more than two weeks treatment with immunosuppressants\n             (including systemic corticosteroids), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or application of\n             topical steroids to the ulcer surface within 30 days of initial screening, or who\n             receive such medications during the screening period, or who are anticipated to\n             require such medications during the course of the study.\n\n          5. Patients on any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days\n             preceding screening.\n\n          6. History of radiation at the ulcer site.\n\n          7. Known history of having Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or HIV.\n\n          8. Study ulcer has been previously treated with tissue engineered materials (e.g.\n             Apligraf\u00ae or Dermagraft\u00ae) or other scaffold materials (e.g. Oasis, Meristem) within\n             the last 30 days\n\n          9. Study ulcer requiring negative pressure wound therapy or hyperbaric oxygen during the\n             course of the trial.\n\n         10. Patients who are unable to understand the aims and objectives of the trial.\n\n         11. Presence of any condition(s) which seriously compromises the subject's ability to\n             complete this study, or has a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.\n\n         12. New York Heard Association (NYHA) Class III and IV congestive heart failure (CHF), as\n             defined by the following criteria: Class III: Symptoms with moderate exertion; Class\n             IV: Symptoms at rest.\n\n         13. Ulcers on the dorsum of the foot or with more than 50% of the ulcer below the\n             malleolus are excluded.\n\n         14. Pregnant or breast feeding.\n\n         15. Currently taking medications which, in the opinion of the treating physician, could\n             affect graft incorporation.\n\n         16. Allergic to gentamicin and/or streptomycin\n\n         17. Known allergy to the components of the multi-layer compression bandaging, or who\n             cannot tolerate multi-layer compression therapy.\n\n         18. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months of screening."
