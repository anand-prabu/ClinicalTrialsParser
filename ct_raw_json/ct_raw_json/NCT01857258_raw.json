The central hypothesis is that a green tea confection will protect\n      against vascular endothelial dysfunction by suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia. The\n      central hypothesis of this application will be assessed by developing a green tea-containing\n      confection, examining its physiochemical properties and its inhibition of starch digestion,\n      and then validating its vasoprotective activities in healthy humans by assessing its blood\n      glucose-regulating activities."
