Patients are stratified by disease\n      (chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs indolent lymphoma vs Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia).\n\n      All patients receive dolastatin 10 IV bolus every 3 weeks. Patients continue treatment until\n      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's withdrawal from the study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 74 patients will be accrued for this study over 15 months."
