            "textblock": "Individuals with prediabetes have a high risk to be insulin resistant and at risk for type 2\n      diabetes. Weight loss has been known to decrease insulin resistance and risk for diabetes as\n      well as other metabolic abnormalities. Diet alone does not provide a long term solution for\n      most individuals, as weight regain is common.  Exenatide, a GLP-1 agonist approved for\n      lowering blood glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes, has been associated\n      with restoration of the first-phase insulin response when administered intravenously to\n      patients with type 2 diabetes. In longer clinical trials, it is associated with progressive\n      decreases in body weight, and improvement in the dyslipidemia that characterizes insulin\n      resistance, although insulin resistance was not quantified. Given these favorable metabolic\n      effects, and the fact that continued use might allow for longer-term weight loss or\n      prevention of weight regain,  it would seem that this drug might yield even better diabetes\n      prevention than dietary weight loss alone. We will compare 2 groups of prediabetic insulin\n      resistant individuals, all on a weight loss diet and one group on exenatide and the other on\n      placebo.  We will evaluate restoration of first phase insulin response, reversal of\n      prediabetes, and improvement in insulin resistance, in addition to amount of weight loss."
