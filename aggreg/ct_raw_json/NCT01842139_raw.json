To examine the immunogenicity of WT1 peptide (WT1 126-134 peptide vaccine) emulsified in\n      Montanide (Montanide ISA 51 VG) in elderly patients with AML.\n\n      II. To determine whether toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist (poly-L-lysine and\n      carboxymethyl cellulose [poly ICLC]) could be a potent immunologic adjuvant, and increases\n      the frequencies of WT1-specific T cells following vaccination.\n\n      III. To determine whether depletion of regulatory T cells occurs upon administration of the\n      anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)25 monoclonal antibody Basiliximab, and whether this is\n      associated with increased frequencies of WT1-specific T cells following vaccination.\n\n      IV. To assess whether WT1 vaccination +/- TLR3 agonist (poly ICLC) combined with Basiliximab\n      results in decreased levels of WT1 transcripts in peripheral blood cells compared to WT1\n      vaccination +/- TLR3 as measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain\n      reaction (qRT-PCR).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To examine the safety and gain preliminary information on efficacy of WT1 peptide\n      vaccination +/- TLR3 agonist (poly ICLC) combined with Basiliximab.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM A: Patients receive WT1 126-134 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA 51 VG\n      subcutaneously (SC) on day 0 and then once every 2 weeks.\n\n      ARM B: Patients receive WT1 126-134 peptide vaccine emulsified in poly-ICLC SC on day 0 and\n      then once every 2 weeks.\n\n      ARM C: Patients assigned to Arm C receive basiliximab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on\n      day -7 and WT1 126-134 peptide vaccine as in Arm A or Arm B, whichever had a superior\n      cellular immune response.\n\n      In all arms, treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then receive 6 additional monthly vaccinations.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 2 years."
