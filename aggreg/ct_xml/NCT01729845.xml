  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of decitabine followed by
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and cytarabine and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitoxantrone hydrochloride,
      etoposide, cytarabine, and decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine priming followed by sequential
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride/etoposide/cytarabine (MEC) chemotherapy in adults with
      relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine, within the limits of a Phase 1/2 study, disease response and duration of
      remission.

      II. Identify biomarkers (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] methylation and/or gene
      expression changes) associated with treatment responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of decitabine followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days -9 to -5 (dose level
      1), days -11 to -5 (dose level 2), or days -14 to -5 (dose level 3).

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days
      1-5, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5.
      Patients achieving complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet count recovery
      (CRp) may receive up to 2 courses of induction therapy and up to 2 courses of consolidation
      therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5
      years.

             defined as being afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 24-48 hours
