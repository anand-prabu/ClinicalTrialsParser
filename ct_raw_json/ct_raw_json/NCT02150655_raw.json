It is hypothesized that\n      infection and toxins will alter the vaginal microbiome and metabolome, increasing the risk\n      of preterm labour and infertility in Rwandan women. In a sub-group of subjects, a\n      preliminary assessment of the ability of orally administered probiotic lactobacilli to\n      restore the vaginal microbiota  to a healthy state and lower environmental toxins will be\n      completed."
