An arterial line is required for assessment of dPP. On a modified Penaz\n      technique, a non-invasive measurement device  is now available commercially. In this study,\n      the reference technique based on arterial measurement and a respiratory variation monitor\n      (Pestel G et al, Anesth Analg 2009; 108:1823-9) was compared to the non-invasive device a\n      clinical setting. At defined time points, systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressure\n      and dPP were compared using Bland-Altmann Analysis (Bland JM, Altman DG, Lancet 1986; 1:\n      307-10)"
