  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal is to determine the effect of Phentermine and Topiramate on gastric
      emptying, gastric accommodation, and satiety and satiation in obese participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a randomized controlled trial of combination phentermine topiramate
      versus placebo given orally for 10-15 days.  Dosing of 3.75/23 mg days 1-5, increased to
      7.5/46 mg days 6-14.  Participants will be randomized according to a computer generated
      randomization schedule generated by the study statistician's office and submitted to the
      Mayo Clinic CTSA research pharmacy. Allocation will be concealed.  The study blind will be
      retained until all the data on gastric emptying, accommodation, satiation and satiety have
      been recorded and transmitted to the statistician for data lock.

    <description>The primary endpoints for analysis of gastric function and satiation will be:
T1/2  of gastric emptying of solids (scintigraphic transit of solid meal)
Fasting whole gastric volume (gastric accommodation testing)
Postprandial whole gastric volume (gastric accommodation testing)
Maximum volume of Ensure ingested (nutrient drink testing)
Caloric intake from a standard buffet meal (buffet meal)
Ghrelin, GLP-1, CCK, PYY levels integrated over the 1.5 hours after the meal</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The secondary endpoints of  gastric transit, satiety and meal preferences will be:
Gastric residual at 2 and 4 hours (scintigraphic transit)
T1/2  of gastric emptying of liquids (scintigraphic transit)
Aggregate symptom score 30 minutes after ingestion of Ensure(nutrient drink tests)
Individual postprandial symptom scores (nutrient drink testing)
Ghrelin, GLP-1, CCK, PYY change from baseline during the first 15 minutes after meal

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Obese subjects with BMI&gt; 30 Kg/m2: Otherwise healthy individuals who are not
             currently on treatment for cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal,
             hematological, neurological, endocrine (other than hyperglycemia not requiring
             medical therapy) and unstable psychiatric disease.

          -  Age: 18-70 years

          -  Gender: Men or women. Women of childbearing potential will have negative pregnancy
             test before initiation of medication.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Weight &gt;300 lbs which is the limit of safety for the SPECT scanner

          -  Concomitant use of appetite suppressants (i.e. caffeine based or diethylpropion) or
             orlistat (Xenical®)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (Blood pressure greater than 160/90 mmHg)

          -  Concentration of fasting glucose greater than 240 mg/dl

          -  Concentration of triglycerides greater than 400 mg/dl

          -  Type 1 Diabetes

          -  use of anti-diabetic drugs other than metformin,

          -  history of nephrolithiasis,

          -  recurrent major depression, presence or history of suicidal behaviour or ideation
             with intent to act, and current substantial depressive symptoms (Patient Health
             Questionnaire [PHQ-9]21 total score ≥10).

          -  Concomitant use of MAOI inhibitors (i.e. phenelzine, selegiline), serotonergic
             agents, and other centrally acting appetite suppressants

          -  Significant psychiatric dysfunction based upon screening with the Hospital Anxiety
             and Depression Scale [HADS] self-administered alcoholism screening test (SAAST,
             substance abuse) and the questionnaire on eating and weight patterns (binge eating
             disorders and bulimia). If such a dysfunction is identified by a HADS score ≥11 in
             any of the subscales or difficulties with substance or eating disorders, the
             participant will be excluded and given a referral letter to his/her primary care
             doctor for further appraisal and follow-up.

          -  End stage renal disease or liver cirrhosis

          -  Intake of medication that could interfere with the interpretation of the study or
             cause drug interaction (i.e. ketoconazole, erythromycin).   Specifically, birth

             permissible.
