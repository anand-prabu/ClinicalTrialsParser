Drugs such as\n      goserelin, leuprolide, flutamide, or bicalutamide may stop the adrenal glands from producing\n      androgens. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor\n      to kill tumor cells. Combining hormone therapy with internal radiation may be effective in\n      treating locally recurrent prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of hormone therapy followed by internal\n      radiation in treating patients who have locally recurrent prostate cancer following\n      external-beam radiation therapy."
