Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional\n      8 months after reaching CR.\n\n      X-rays or scans are performed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for the\n      second year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued into this study."
