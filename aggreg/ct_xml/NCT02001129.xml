    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effectiveness of three different ways of helping patients
      attend their recommended eye care appointments. The three ways are 1) usual care, which
      involves a standard reminder letter; 2) automated telephone calls, which utilizes a machine
      to automatically call patients one month prior to their recommended follow-up date;
      3)personalized telephone calls, which utilizes a staff member to personally call patients
      and offer them the opportunity to schedule at the time of the telephone call.
