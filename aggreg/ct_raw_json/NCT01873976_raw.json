It is rare, but it can be serious.\n      Cardiomyopathy in children can result in death, disability, heart transplantation or serious\n      heart rhythm disorders. Natural substances in the blood called cardiac biomarkers can be\n      measured in the laboratory and could be a less invasive way (compared to echocardiograms or\n      MRIs) to detect heart dysfunction in children with cardiomyopathy.  Little is known about\n      how useful and valid cardiac biomarkers are in the diagnosis and determination of the\n      symptoms in children with cardiomyopathy.  The long-term goal of this project is to study\n      how helpful measuring cardiac biomarkers in children with cardiomyopathy is to their doctors\n      in managing the care of these patients as well as improving their overall health.  Measures\n      of these cardiac biomarkers could help doctors in determining how best to care for a child\n      with cardiomyopathy, including when to consider heart transplantation as a treatment option."

Highly\n      sensitive and specific cardiac biomarkers or panels of biomarkers, representing different\n      pathologic mechanisms or pathways, are the least invasive (a particularly important\n      consideration in children) and most-cost-effective approach to the early detection of\n      cardiac dysfunction.  The long-term goal of this project is to identify such biomarkers in\n      children with cardiomyopathy.  These findings could represent a major advance in determining\n      the most appropriate evidence-based clinical care for these children, including when to\n      consider heart transplantation.\n\n      The specific aims of this study are:\n\n        1. To determine the ability of established and novel cardiac biomarkers to predict short-\n           and long-term outcomes in children with newly diagnosed (incident) dilated\n           cardiomyopathy (DCM)\n\n        2. To assess the clinical utility of cardiac biomarkers of collagen metabolism in\n           determining the presence of myocardial fibrosis, as established by cardiac MRI (cMRI),\n           and left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, as established by echocardiography in\n           both newly diagnosed and existing cases of idiopathic and familial hypertrophic\n           cardiomyopathy (HCM) in children.\n\n        3. To determine whether longitudinal changes in cardiac biomarkers are associated with\n           worsening heart failure (HF) class in clinically stable children with dilated or\n           hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  This study will determine the importance of serological\n           biomarkers, in conjunction with cardiac imaging, in the early identification of heart\n           disease before cardiac remodeling and functional impairment have become irreversible in\n           a pediatric population.\n\n      This is a 5-year prospective study of up to 480 children with either primary dilated or\n      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The study will have three components: 1) clinical data\n      collection by chart review, 2) biospecimen collection and testing, and 3) centralized review\n      and measurement of echocardiograms and cMRIs."
