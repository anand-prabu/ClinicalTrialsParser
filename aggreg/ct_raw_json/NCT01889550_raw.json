The aim is to assist the pregnant women to make their own decisions, and\n      neutral and adequate counseling is a prerequisite during prenatal diagnosis. To make an\n      informed choice, the pregnant women must be informed about the benefits and potential\n      disadvantages of prenatal diagnosis and with this background be able to make a comprehensive\n      evaluation, where ethical values will have a high impact.\n\n      The overall purpose of this project is to increase pregnant women's knowledge of prenatal\n      screening for Downs syndrome, and thereby an option to make an informed choice. The project\n      is planned as a research into whether the use of an eHealth solution (in this project an\n      interactive website) may be an appropriate intervention for pregnant women.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Part one consists of an identification of the problem\n\n      Part two consists of developing a website with relevant information about prenatal screening\n      for Downs syndrome.\n\n      Part three is an effect measurement. The effect of the intervention is measured through a\n      randomized controlled trail in which the essentials of the measurement will be the pregnant\n      women's knowledge and behavior in relation to prenatal diagnosis. Twice 300 pregnant women\n      will be included in the project.\n\n      Results:\n\n      The research aims at generating new knowledge about ways to inform pregnant women about\n      prenatal diagnosis and prenatal screening. The expected results are:\n\n        -  Higher knowledge about prenatal diagnosis for the pregnant women.\n\n        -  Less difficulty in making an informed choice for the coming parents.\n\n        -  Easy access to high quality information.\n\n        -  Equity in access to high quality information."
