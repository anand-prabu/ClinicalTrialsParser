  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to characterize the relationship between changes in emotional
      distress, opioid use, and pain throughout surgery and recovery. Additionally, the
      investigators aim to compare the effectiveness of post-surgical motivational interviewing
      and physician-guided opioid weaning vs. usual care on reducing persistent opioid use.
      Overall, the proposed research will advance knowledge regarding the role of psychological
      factors contributing to persistent opioid use after surgery.
