  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis is treated with a variety of systemic and locally applied drugs. The
      effectiveness of the intranasally applied formulations is diminished by the cleaning
      mechanisms of the nose, rhinorrhea in particular. Slowing down of the clearance of the nasal
      mucosa and prolonging the contact time of locally applied drugs with the nasal mucosa would
      improve their efficacy. One method is creating dosage forms containing mucoadhesive
      polymers. We have demonstrated that a mucoadhesive solution containing HPMC enhances the
      clinical efficacy of oxymetazoline. However, the industrial development of fixed
      combinations of pharmaceutical compound and mucoadhesive carrier requires substantial
      investments, escalating manifold if different pharmaceutical compounds have to be rendered
      mucoadhesive.

      NoAl is a cellulose derivative powder, which forms a gel layer on contact with the mucosal
      surface of the nose blocking the contact of the pollen grains with the nasal mucosa in
      seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, there is another potential benefit of applying NoAl
      (HPMC) along with other commercially available drugs for local treatment of rhinitis, as the
      formation of a gel layer can substantially delay their clearance from the nose and thus
      increase their effectiveness. This hypothesis needs to be substantiated clinically.

      The main objective of the trial is to test the synergy between HPMC and oxymetazoline (both
      applied nasally) on the increase of peak nasal inspiratory flow in patients suffering from
      moderately severe / severe persistent allergic rhinitis.

      The design of the trial is parallel-groups, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled,
      single centre study.

      Forty patients are randomly assigned to receive either oxymetazoline followed by HPMC (Group
      A) or oxymetazoline followed by placebo (Group B).

      Each patient is followed up for 15 days. Day 1 is the screening and inclusion visit. Data
      will then be collected on day 8 &amp; 15. Patients will fill in diaries their everyday symptoms,
      adverse events and applied medications.
