Postpartum women who are older, who have a history of unintended pregnancy, who do not\n           desire another child within 2 years, and who were counseled about LARC during their\n           pregnancy are more likely to have interest in using LARC.\n\n        2. Postpartum women who are older are more likely to be aware of LARC methods.\n\n        3. HIV+ postpartum Malawian women will have similar knowledge about LARC as postpartum\n           Malawian women who are HIV-."
