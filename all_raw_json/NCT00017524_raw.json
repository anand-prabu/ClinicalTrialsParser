Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AG2037 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-60 patients will be accrued for this study."
