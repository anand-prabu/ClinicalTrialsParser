            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplant may\n      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n      Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found\n      in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the\n      side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving filgrastim together with\n      chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Patients also\n      receive mitoxantrone IV over 1 hour daily and dexamethasone IV every 12 hours for a total of\n      4 doses on days 1-2. Patients receive G-CSF SQ daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until\n      the completion of leukapheresis. PBSC are collected on 3 consecutive days after blood counts\n      recover.\n\n      In the transplant phase, patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have not exceeded\n      pretransplant radiotherapy limits receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 and -6\n      and total body irradiation twice daily on days -4 through -1. Autologous PBSC are reinfused\n      on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 21 or\n      until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma or patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have exceeded\n      pretransplant radiotherapy limits receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours daily on days -6\n      through -3, carmustine IV over 1 hour on day -6, and etoposide IV over 4 hours every 12\n      hours for a total of 6 doses on days -6 through -4. Autologous PBSC are reinfused on day 0.\n      Patients also receive G-CSF IV daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 21 or until\n      blood counts recover.\n\n      All patients receive radiotherapy for any residual nodal masses measuring at least 2 cm 5\n      days a week beginning on day 28.\n\n      Patients are followed at day 100, then every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 2\n      years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      This was changed to a treatment guideline study."
