We have recently shown that the stimulant\n      methylphenidate (MPH) and the non-stimulant atomoxetine (ATX) produce clinical improvement\n      via a common mechanism in motor cortex, and distinct actions in frontostriatal and midline\n      cingulate-precuneus regions. These exciting findings offer a window into the common and\n      unique neurophysiological mechanisms of response to stimulant and non-stimulant treatments.\n      However, the interpretation and clinical utility of these results would be greatly enhanced\n      by in-depth investigation of the impact of the two treatments on relevant neural networks,\n      and analyses which evaluate whether improvement is achieved via normalization or other\n      adaptive changes in brain function."

Our central hypotheses are that clinical improvement is associated\n      with: (i) normalization of reduced connectivity of regions within the 'task-positive'\n      network, with resultant increased inhibition of motor cortex, and (ii) normalization of low\n      task-related connectivity in regions within the task-negative network for MPH and the\n      'task-positive' network for ATX.\n\n      This research proposes to test a model which posits a neurophysiological basis of mechanisms\n      of response to stimulant and non-stimulant medications, and fits with our long term\n      objectives of being able to match treatments to individual patients. Testing this model\n      requires large samples of youth scanned using fMRI before and after treatment, and matched\n      healthy controls also scanned twice. We will use an innovative network-based approach to\n      study the effects of treatment, building on results from our current fMRI treatment study,\n      and incorporating new theoretical approaches to understanding ADHD and its treatment."
