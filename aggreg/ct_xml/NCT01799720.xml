    <textblock>
      The oxidation level of unsaturated fatty acid supplements commercialized in capsules could
      be a serious problem for manufacturers and a risk to consumers' health by ingesting
      substances whose effects are not desired. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to
      analyze the effect of dietary supplements Omega-3 with different levels of oxidation in the
      lipid profile of women who consume these supplements. For this purpose the investigators
      have designed a single-blind, parallel-groups, randomized controlled trial. Finally, 52
      women between 25 and 75 years old were randomly distributed into three groups: (1) took 2
      capsules/day of one of the less oxidized oil (containing 300 mg EPA + DHA) and diet, (2)
      took 2 capsules/day of one of the most oxidized oil (containing 300 mg EPA + DHA) and diet
      and (3) no capsules, only received the diet. There was a 30 days follow-up . All groups
      followed a low cholesterol diet. Circulating glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and
      glutamic pyruvic transaminase were determined at the beginning and end of a 30 day period.
