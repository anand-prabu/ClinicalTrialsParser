These couples would be the focus of the future large prevention\n      trial therefore it is critical that the protocol team explore effective strategies for\n      identifying and recruiting these couples.\n\n      Men and women (index participants) who are attending antenatal (ANC) and Tuberculosis (TB)\n      clinics will be recruited for this study. If they agree to take part, a testing team will\n      visit their household and offer all adults staying in the house the opportunity to receive\n      an HIV test.\n\n      Three hundred index participants will be enrolled into the study and have their homes\n      visited by the testing team. The number of household members tested will depend on the\n      number of people living in each household."

This study uses\n      an observational design to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based testing\n      for HIV testing of partners and the effectiveness of this intervention to identify HIV\n      discordant couples. It is hypothesized that a home-based  testing intervention  will\n      increase the number of partners testing for HIV and will result in increased identi\ufb01cation\n      of newly-diagnosed HIV-discordant couples, the target population of the planned Enhanced\n      Prevention in Couples (EPIC) study.\n\n      Primary objectives of this study include:\n\n        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based testing for HIV testing of\n           partners of index participants\n\n        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of home-based partner testing strategies to identify\n           HIV-serodiscordant couples\n\n        3.
