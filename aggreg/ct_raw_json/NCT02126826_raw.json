Males or females without any clinically relevant medical disorders according to the\n             investigator's assessment, as based on the following: a complete medical history\n             including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate), 12-lead\n             electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests\n\n          2. For OA patients: Evidence of OA of the knee by radiography or by magnetic resonance\n             tomography (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1, 2, or 3; excluding grades 0 and 4) of the knee\n             (tibiofemoral joint only) within the last 5 years consistent with the clinical\n             diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee according to ACR (American College of\n             Rheumatology) guidelines\n\n          3. For OA patients: ARA (American Rheumatism Association) functional class I, II, or III\n\n          4. For OA patients: Average pain in the index knee over the previous 48 hours greater\n             than or equal to 4 on the 11-item Likert scale at two time points: 1) at screening\n             (if not on analgesic medication) or after 3 days of wash-out of analgesic medication,\n             and 2) in the evening prior to randomisation\n\n          5. For OA patients: Presence of bothersome OA related pain for most days within the last\n             month prior to screening at the investigator's discretion, or pain requiring\n             analgesic treatment on more than 3 days per week during the last month prior to\n             screening.\n\n          6. Age 35 to 65 years (inclusive)\n\n          7. BMI (Body Mass Index) 18.5 to 33 kg/m2 (inclusive)\n\n          8.

Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate or\n             electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and judged clinically relevant by the\n             investigator\n\n          2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic\n             blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg\n\n          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to\n             be of clinical relevance\n\n          4. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator\n\n          5. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,\n             immunological or hormonal disorders\n\n          6.
