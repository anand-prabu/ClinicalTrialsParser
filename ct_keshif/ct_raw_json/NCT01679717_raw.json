The participants in the control group\n      will receive the standard treatment at Diakonhjemmet hospital: immobilisation of the thumb\n      in a splint for six weeks. The participants in the intervention group will use a soft splint\n      for six weeks, but will be instructed to remove the splint daily to perform exercises for\n      the thumb. A total of 70 patients will be included in the study."
