The preterm infants are at\n      increased risk of respiratory distress, episodes with low oxygenation, mechanical\n      ventilation, risk of hypocapnia and labile or low blood pressure.  These conditions can\n      affect the microcirculation and hence the oxygenation of the brain. Hyperoxia is also a\n      point of interest, since high levels of oxygen can cause vasoconstriction.\n\n      The investigators will examine the normal physiological cerebral response to exposure of\n      oxygen in a group of preterm infants with a gestational age (GA) of 32-37 weeks and a group\n      of term infants.\n\n      The investigators will do dynamic research with continuously monitoring of the cerebral\n      oxygenation using the INVOS\u00ae Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter (Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS)).\n      Reproducibility is examined by repeated measurements.\n\n      There will be no follow-up."
