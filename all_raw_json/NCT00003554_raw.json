Evaluate the role of this regimen in improving\n      the response rate to melphalan and prednisone in these patients. III. Determine whether the\n      regimen decreases residual disease in these patients. IV. Evaluate the toxic effects of this\n      regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV every week for 4 weeks. Treatment is repeated every 6\n      months for six courses. Treatment may be discontinued after four courses if uncontrolled\n      infection occurs. Patients also receive oral melphalan and prednisone for 4 days which begin\n      after the first course of rituximab. Treatment is repeated every 4-6 weeks for at least nine\n      courses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24\n      months."
