      Our Aim is to identify patient risk factors and clinical practices associated with
      healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs) after cardiac surgery.

      We will use prospectively collected data housed within the MSTCVS-QC (Michigan Society of
      Thoracic &amp; Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality Collaborative) to reveal risk factors that
      elevate a patient's risk of developing HAIs. The results of this analysis will form the
      foundation for the development of standardized regional practices to reduce HAIs. We will
      explore the effect of traditional patient-level measures (age, sex, comorbid conditions),
      process measures (timing and selection of antibiotics, continuous insulin infusion,
      transfusions), and surgical practices (use of bilateral internal mammary artery usage among
      diabetics, vein harvesting approach).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 400,000 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures are performed every year
      in the United States (U.S.). Patients undergoing CABG surgery are at risk for a number of
      adverse sequelae, many of which impact survival and contribute to overall health-care costs.
      Healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs), including pneumonia and superficial and deep sternal
      wound infections, occur among 16% of CABG patients and elevate a patient's risk of mortality
      and add excess upfront and long-term expenditures to the health care system.

      A number of barriers prevent wide-scale improvements in HAl rates within the setting of CABG
      surgery. While a number of HAl prophylaxis measures have been developed, these measures do
      not fully encompass the set of practices that may impact a patient's risk of HAl.
      Identifying cardiac surgery specific risk factors would serve as the foundation for targeted
      quality improvement strategies. In the absence of definitive data concerning best practices,
      HAl prophylaxis is variable across surgeons and institutions, resulting in unnecessary
      morbidity and cost. Prior work has shown the value of implementing evidence-based protocols
      in the general intensive care unit setting. To what extent the implementation of cardiac
      surgery specific standardized practices results in lower HAl rates is uncertain. An
      understanding of the effectiveness of this approach would certainly assist surgeons and
      institutions in providing safer care to their patient populations.

      Rates of HAIs vary from 0-26% across the 33 institutions performing CABG surgery in
      Michigan. This application seeks to reduce this rate by identifying and subsequently
      implementing standardized practices, and evaluating their impact on HAl rates. This study
      will be based on the prospective data and regional quality improvement activities and
      infrastructure of the Michigan Society of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality
      Collaborative (MSTCVS-QC). We will evaluate the effectiveness of these standardized
      practices in reducing HAIs regionally and relative to national rates during the same time
      period.

      Our Aim is to identify patient risk factors and clinical practices associated with HAIs
      after cardiac surgery.

      We will use prospectively collected data housed within the MSTCVS-QC to reveal risk factors
      that elevate a patient's risk of developing HAIs. The results of this analysis will form the
      foundation for the development of standardized regional practices to reduce HAIs. We will
      explore the effect of traditional patient-level measures (age, sex, comorbid conditions),
      process measures (timing and selection of antibiotics, continuous insulin infusion,
      transfusions), and surgical practices (use of bilateral internal mammary artery usage among
      diabetics, vein harvesting approach).
