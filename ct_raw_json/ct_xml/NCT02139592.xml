      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of brentuximab vedotin (recombinant) for
      IV infusion (ADCETRIS IV Infusion 50 mg) in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30+
      Hodgkin's lymphoma or anaplastic large cell lymphoma in the routine clinical setting, as
      well as to collect efficacy information for reference.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present survey was designed to evaluate the safety of brentuximab vedotin (recombinant)
      for IV infusion (ADCETRIS IV Infusion 50 mg) in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30+
      Hodgkin's lymphoma or anaplastic large cell lymphoma in the routine clinical setting.

      The usual adult dosage is 1.8 mg/kg (body weight) of brentuximab vedotin (recombinant)
      infused intravenously once every three weeks. The dose should be adjusted depending on the
      patient's condition. See the &quot;PRECAUTIONS&quot; section of the package insert.
