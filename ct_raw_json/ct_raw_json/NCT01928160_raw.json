In\n      patients that develop resistance to first-line therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors\n      (TKIs) the drug is usually stopped and the patient is switched to chemotherapy. Drugs used\n      in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium, carboplatin, and cisplatin, work in different\n      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the\n      enzymes needed for cell growth.

To determine the overall survival (OS) and response rate in this patient population.\n\n      II. To assess the safety of erlotinib in combination with chemotherapy in this patient\n      population.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine whether presence of the T790M resistance mutation can be used to predict\n      which patients will benefit from the addition of erlotinib to chemotherapy.\n\n      II. To determine if patients with NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations who develop\n      acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) develop additional\n      mutations/genetic alterations on progression.\n\n      III. To determine whether any additional biomarkers (e.g., mesenchymal-epithelial transition\n      [MET] amplification, EGFR mutations detected in circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid\n      [DNA]) predict response to second-line therapy in this patient population.\n\n      IV.
