This trial is an open label single-center,\n      dose escalation safety study. A total of up to 34 patients are planned to enroll into the\n      study. Doses will be allocated to patients using a two-stage Up-and-Down dose escalation\n      scheme without intra-patient dose escalation. Patients will receive Carfilzomib on Days 1,\n      2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 every 28 days with dose escalation from 27, 36, 45 to 56 mg/ m2  .  No\n      matter what target dose the subject will receive, days 1 and 2 doses in the first cycle will\n      always be 20 mg/m2, followed by target dose for all subsequent dates and cycles.\n      Bendamustine will be given IV on days 1 and 2 with dose escalation up to 90 mg/m2 and\n      dexamethasone 20 mg po or IV on 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23 of each 28-day cycle. Study\n      treatment will be given until 8 cycles of treatment are completed or until disease\n      progression, whichever comes first. This protocol can also be used as induction therapy for\n      transplant."

Patients with known brain metastases (treated or not) will be excluded from this\n             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop\n             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic\n             and other AEs.\n\n         13.
