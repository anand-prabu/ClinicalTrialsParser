Hepatic impairment should not have been associated to an underlying systemic disease,\n\n         10. Medications necessary for the management of the hepatic disease or concomitant\n             conditions were permitted if the therapeutic regimen has been stable for at least 7\n             days before BIA 9-1067 administration and if they did not interfere with the kinetics\n             of the tested product,\n\n             Matched Healthy Subjects only:\n\n         11.
