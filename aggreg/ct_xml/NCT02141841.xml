  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed in 131 adult patients undergoing transurethral, urological or lower
      limb surgery under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia. Patients were stratified
      according to age: 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and 71-80 years. The spinal component
      of the anesthetic was established by bolus administration of up-and-down doses of 0.75%
      plain bupivacaine, determined by Dixon's method. The degree of motor block after intrathecal
      administration of each concentration was evaluated by the modified Bromage and Hip motor
      function score. The EC50 were estimated from the up-and-down sequences using the method of
      Dixon and Massey and logistic regression. Other endpoints were included on the basis of
      sensory block level, duration of motor blockade, hypotension, and vasopressor requirements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - ASA physical status I-II adult patients who were undergoing transurethral, urological or
        lower limb surgery, primarily under the spinal component of established combined
        epidural-spinal anesthesia, with the epidural component to be used if there was a need for
        intra-operative analgesic supplementation or for postoperative analgesia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diabetes, obesity, neuromuscular diseases, bleeding diathesis,
             hypersensitivity to amide local anesthetics, lumbar vertebrae abnormality, chronic
             back pain, or who were pregnant were excluded from this study
