Those enrolled may be required to provide blood, saliva, urine or stool\n      samples, and to undergo ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland, ovaries or testes,\n      adrenal glands or other parts of the body.  Laboratory or X-ray studies may be done for\n      diagnostic or treatment purposes.  In some cases, patients will receive medical or surgical\n      treatment for their disorder.  Patients and family members of patients with a hereditary\n      disorder may be asked to provide a blood sample for genetic analysis."

The research-directed evaluations may include blood, saliva, urine or stool\n      samples, and/or ultrasound examinations.  In some patients with endocrine disorders,\n      laboratory or radiological studies will be performed to confirm the diagnosis or to aid in\n      the management of the patient, as would be done in current clinical practice.  In some\n      cases, the patient will receive medical or surgical treatment for their disorder.
