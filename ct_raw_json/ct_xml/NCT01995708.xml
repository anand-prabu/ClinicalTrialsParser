  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the investigator can help the immune system to work
      against myeloma.

      This study will see if a vaccine made with altered dendritic cells will make T cells work
      against tumor cells. The stem cells collected for the transplant will also be used to grow
      dendritic cells in the lab. The dendritic cells will carry the antigens. These cells then
      will be injected under the skin. The investigators will do lab studies before and after the
      vaccination to find out if the vaccine is working.

    <description>The safety of the vaccine will be monitored and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting to the Food and Drug Administration. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as grade 3 or higher toxicity.</description>

    <description>The secondary goal of the study is to monitor and compare changes in T cell responses (e.g., intracellular cytokine secretion assays, CTL responses, and immune reconstitution analyses) stimulated by the CT7, MAGE-A3, and WT1 mRNA-electroporated LCs relative to pre-vaccine baselines.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective, two-arm phase I randomized trial. Patients will be accrued only from and treated at MSKCCand The Rockefeller University/Center for Clinical &amp; Translational Science . The study will assess autologous LCs presenting CT7, MAGE-A3, and WT1 after electroporation with CT7, MAGE-A3, and WT1 mRNA. Twenty patients will accrue to the study and ten will receive vaccines at 9x10^6 LCs per dose (i.e., combination of 3x10^6 CT7 mRNA-electroporated LCs + 3x10^6 MAGE-A3 mRNA-electroporated LCs + 3x10^6 WT1 mRNA-electroporated LCs) and another ten who will not receive any LC vaccines but will otherwise undergo identical cytoreduction, ASCT, and standard supportive care. At approximately 3 months after ASCT and as deemed clinically appropriate,  patients will start lenalidomide maintenance therapy, which is now standard to delay disease progression.</description>
