Recently, it has been showed that\n      culture medium supplemented with GM-CSF, may improve the embryo outcomes in IVF. In this\n      trial the investigators will test the potential benefits of this culture medium on embryos\n      of patients experiencing recurrent implantation failure. 100 women with recurrent\n      implantation failure, at least three failed previous IVF attempts with at least 8 good\n      embryos transferred no more than 40 years old will be selected. These patients  will be\n      assigned to two arms, one experimental and one other of control by a computer generated\n      sequence. After the oocyte retrieval and fertilization by ICSI procedure, the fertilised\n      oocyte (2PN)will cultured with the GM-CSF supplemented culture medium (EmbryoGen, Origio,\n      Denmark), or in normal culture in micro drop of 30microliters under oil until the day of\n      transfer (day three or 8 cells sage embryos). A maximum of three embryos will be\n      transferred. The pregnancy rate the implantation rate will be the outcomes considered"
