Treatment integrity\n      is established by supervision in both groups.\n\n      Outcome measures Main study parameter is the number of suicide attempts/self-harming acts\n      (the Life Time Parasuicide Count and the Parasuicide Scale of the Borderline Personality\n      Severity Index). Second study parameter is the severity of borderline symptomatology\n      (BPDSI). Quality of life as measured on the SF-36, and the EQ-5D and psychopathological\n      symptoms (BSI) will also be taken into account. The cost-effectiveness of the inpatient\n      program compared to the outpatient program will be examined (TiC-P).\n\n      Sample size. The researchers expect that after 12 weeks of treatment, 20% of the patients of\n      the intervention group still show suicidal and/or self-harming behavior compared to 60% of\n      the patients in the control condition, and that this difference sustains after 24 weeks and\n      will be gradually reduced between 24 and 52 weeks by the additional reduction in suicidal\n      and/or self-harming behavior in the control group.  To be able to detect a difference of 40%\n      after 12 weeks, with a power of 0.80 and \u03b1 = 0.05, 36 patients per experimental condition\n      are required. The researchers expect to recruit about 150 patients, which guarantees enough\n      power, even with a 20% drop out rate."
