This study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic cancer\n      who are refractory or for whom there are no standard therapeutic options. Tanibirumab will\n      be administered intravenously to such patients over 60 minutes on Day 1, 8, and 15 (subject\n      to change pending PK and toxicity data). Each treatment cycle will be a minimum of 28 days\n      in length. The dose escalation study employing a 3 + 3 design is designed to identify the\n      RP2D which will be based on safety, tolerability and PK of the RP2D. This study is expected\n      to enroll a total of approximately 18-24 patients."
