      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of upper airway
      muscle physical therapy utilizing negative airway pressure (NAP) breathing training in
      patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) in reducing both signs (apnea hypopnea
      index) and symptoms (i.e., daytime sleepiness).The key to the proposed therapy is the use of
      Negative Air Pressure when awake so that the increased reflex phasic drive to the muscles
      will result in muscle conditioning.  Interestingly, other studies have indicated that upper
      airway muscle training may be useful in treating OSAS, but these studies used techniques
      that were not scientifically designed{Puhan, 2006 8195 /id} or used a technique (electrical
      stimulation) that was not well tolerated.{Lequeux, 2005 7514 /id}

      Overview: Subjects with OSAS (but not using CPAP) will undergo NAP physical therapy of the
      upper airway, utilizing a physiologically determined training pressure and protocol, three
      days a week (approximately 30 minute sessions each) for a period of three months. Overnight
      sleep studies will be performed pre- and post-study. Primary outcome measurements include
      the pre- and post-study Apnea/Hypopnea index (AHI) and daytime hypersomnolence symptom
      scores. Each subject's total study time is approximately a 3-4 month period which includes
      screening visit, pre and post study overnight polysomnography, and therapy sessions of 3-4 a
      week for three months.
