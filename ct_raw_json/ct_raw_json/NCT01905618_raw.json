            "textblock": "Ten medical schools are matched and then randomized, with 5 schools being randomized to MME\n      and 5 schools to TE.\n\n      The primary aim of the study is to refine, implement, and evaluate whether a multi-modal\n      educational (MME) approach is more effective than traditional educational (TE) approach for\n      developing skill in the use of the 5As counseling steps for tobacco dependence treatment.\n\n      Multi-Modal Education(MME)Approach:\n\n      The MME approach includes: 1) a web-based course during the first-year of medical school; 2)\n      a tobacco counseling role-play exercise; 3) training preceptors in the use of the 5As,\n      preceptor observation of students in the use of 5As and providing instruction and feedback\n      to students during a designated third-year clerkship rotation; and 4) a booster session\n      provided during the third-year clerkship experience. These components are designed to\n      enhance the interpersonal (e.g. 5As self-reported skill, tobacco treatment knowledge),\n      intrapersonal (e.g. experiences observing 5As, experiences receiving 5As instruction), and\n      organizational factors (e.g. clinic/system reminders) associated with optimal learning. This\n      combination, primarily due to the web-based course/role play and preceptor facilitated\n      teaching methods, is hypothesized to enhance medical students' 5As tobacco dependence\n      treatment skills, compared to the TE approach.\n\n      Traditional Education (TE) Approach:\n\n      The TE approach represents \"usual care\" and includes the current content and method for\n      tobacco teaching among medical schools.  TE content typically includes knowledge in the\n      basic science of tobacco use (e.g. health consequences of tobacco use and passive smoking),\n      and the knowledge and practice of tobacco dependence treatment. All schools prior to\n      randomization met the inclusion criteria that the curriculum devoted no more than four hours\n      to tobacco.\n\n      The RCT's secondary aims address the potential impact of the interpersonal, intrapersonal,\n      and organizational factors on tobacco dependence treatment counseling skills. The hypothesis\n      is that these factors mediate the relationship between the MME curriculum approach and the\n      primary outcome, observed 5As counseling skill, and that the MME approach will outperform\n      the TE approach in each of these areas. This study also will assess the feasibility of\n      implementing the MME across medical schools."
