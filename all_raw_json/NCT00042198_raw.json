Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be\n      efficacious for depression in otherwise healthy individuals, and supportive stress\n      management (SSM) interventions have also been shown to improve depressive symptoms. These\n      therapies have not, however, been tested for depression in individuals who have undergone\n      CABG surgery.\n\n      Participants will be screened for depression within 1 year after CABG surgery. Those who\n      have depression will return for additional testing 1 week later. Eligible participants will\n      be randomized to receive CBT, SSM, or usual care (UC), with no restrictions on nonstudy\n      antidepressants, for 12 weeks. Patients will be monitored for worsening depression referred\n      for additional care if needed. Depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life will\n      be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks after randomization, and 6 months after surgery (2 months\n      after termination of CBT or SSM)."
