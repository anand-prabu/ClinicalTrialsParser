KMI and KMP parameters are KC-specifc indexes that are measured by Ocular Response\n      Analyzer (ORA), based on the distinct ORA-derived waveform characteristics of KC eyes.\n\n      Study participants were recruited from the Cornea Outpatient service in a consecutive if\n      eligible basis. Two study groups were formed: a) FFK group (FFKG) that included patients\n      diagnosed with FFK, and, b) Control group (CG) was formed by refractive surgery candidates.\n\n      All ORA (Reichert Ophthalmic Instrument, Buffalo, NY, USA, software version: 3.01)and\n      Pentacam (Pentacam HR, Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany)measurements  were\n      performed by the same experienced operator in a consistent way"
