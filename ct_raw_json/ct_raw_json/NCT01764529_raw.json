In the Hispanic\n      population of the southwest, CCMs are often caused by an inherited gene mutation\n      (alteration), termed the common Hispanic mutation (CCM1-CHM). There is a wide range of\n      disease severity even among family members with this disease, though the natural history has\n      not been clearly described for this particular population.\n\n      This study will examine factors that influence disease severity through the collection of\n      blood samples, detailed medical histories, physical and neurological exam, and magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The specific goals of this study are to:\n\n        1. establish a registry/database of familial CCM cases with detailed clinical data,\n\n        2. perform genetic testing on participant blood samples to identify other genes that may\n           influence the development and hemorrhage of CCM lesions, and\n\n        3. determine lesion growth during the study."
