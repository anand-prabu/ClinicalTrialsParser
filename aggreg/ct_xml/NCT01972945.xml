      Inserting a telescope into the womb to identify and treat problems with bleeding, pain or
      reproduction is the commonest surgical intervention in gynaecology.  This procedure is known
      as a 'hysteroscopy'.  In recent times the equipment used to perform hysteroscopy have become
      smaller such that it is routinely carried out without anaesthetic in an outpatient hospital
      or community clinic.  The established 'traditional' technique for introducing the
      hysteroscope into the womb involves the use of a 'speculum', which is inserted into the
      vagina.  A speculum is the metal or plastic instrument used to stretch and separate the
      vaginal walls so that the opening to the womb, known as the 'cervix' can be seen.  The
      cervix is then cleaned and frequently grasped with a sharp toothed forcep to provide
      traction before the hysteroscope is inserted.  Whilst hysteroscopy is safe, it is known that
      pain during the procedure can lead to a poor patient experience, and even trigger fainting
      episodes or failure to complete the procedure.  As the hysteroscopes have become smaller, it
      has been recognised that it is possible to access the cervix and womb (i.e. 'uterus')
      directly using the hysteroscopic vision without inserting any of these potentially pain
      inducing vaginal instruments.  There is however, uncertainty whether this newer technique
      known as 'vaginoscopy' or the 'no touch technique' will minimise the pain experienced by the
      patient or reduce the propensity to fainting.  Futhermore, even if vaginoscopy is shown to
      be less painful, the technique may be more prone to failure due to an inability to
      transverse the cervix and enter the uterus without additional instruments.  Post-operative
      infection rates of the uterus may also be higher due to vaginal contamination.

      Reducing pain and complications and improving success of the procedure as well as optimising
      patients experience is important because hysteroscopy is an intimate examination, known to
      be associated with significant anxiety and pain.  Furthermore, the procedure is widely
      practised representing the most common surgical intervention in day-to-day gynaecological
      practice in the UK and elsewhere.  It is therefore important, and timely given that
      outpatient hysteroscopy is increasing especially in community settings, that a large, high
      quality randomised controlled trial comparing 'vaginoscopy' and the 'traditional'
      hysteroscopy is undertaken to resolve the uncertainty as to whether vaginoscopy is less
      painful, safe and more successful than existing approaches to hysteroscopy.

    <description>The primary clinical outcome is a composite outcome of a completed hysteroscopy with an acceptable level of patient reported pain without a vasovagal episode or post-operative uterine infection.  A composite outcome has been chosen as it was felt that all of these factors are important to classify a hysteroscopy as successful.  See individual elements in secondary outcomes for a description of how they will be measured</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The main limitation of outpatient interventions is the amount of pain generated.   Visual analogue scales (VAS) originally devised as measured of well-being have been successfully adapted to measure pain.  This technique involves use of 10cm line of a piece of paper representing a continuum of the patients' opinion of the degree of pain.  It is explained to the patient that the one extreme of the line represent &quot;no pain at all&quot; while the other represents &quot;as much pain as she can possibly imagine&quot;.  The subject rates the degree of pain by placing a mark on the line and scale values are obtained by measuring the distance from zero to that mark.  The reliability of visual analogue scales in the assessment of pain has established as reproducible and accurate.  A baseline pain questionnaire will be administered before the procedure and a further pain assessment will be made immediately after treatment.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Part of the primary clinical outcome is to test whether the vaginoscopic technique reduces the number of procedure failures.  Unfortunately, it is occasionally necessary to abandon outpatient hysteroscopic procedure normally because of pain or anxiety.  The clinician will collect this data on the treatment form.</description>

    <time_frame>Two weeks post procedure (day 14)</time_frame>

    <description>The patient will be contacted two weeks after the procedure.  An infection will be defined as any of the following in the two-week period after the procedure:
If the patient has received antibiotics for a urinary tract infection
If the patient has received antibiotics for vaginal discharge
If the patient reports 2 out of the following 3 symptoms: offensive vaginal discharge, pelvic pain and pyrexia.</description>

    <description>Another part of the primary outcome is assessing whether vaginoscopy reduces the number of vasovagal episodes.  Vaso-vagal reactions will be defined clinically as patient is unable to leave operating couch within 5minutes of cessation of procedure due to feeling faint or dizzy or nauseous.  The clinical will collect this data on the treatment form.</description>

    <description>Vaginoscopy, otherwise known as the 'no touch' technique, describes a technique where the hysteroscope is guided into the uterus without the need for potentially painful vaginal instrumentation i.e. passage of a vaginal speculum to separate the vaginal walls, cleansing of the cervix and sometimes application of traumatic forceps to the ectocervix in order to stabilise it.</description>

    <description>Traditional hysteroscopy consists of introducing speculum and grasping of the cervix to provide counter traction to allow instrumentation of the uterus.  Introducing a speculum also allows the cervix to be cleaned with sterilising fluid.</description>
