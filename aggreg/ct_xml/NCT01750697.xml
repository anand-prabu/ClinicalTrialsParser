    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) in pediatric patients with severe
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) or microscopic polyangiitis. Patients will
      receive MabThera/Rituxan 375 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age at screening between &gt;/= 2 and &lt; 18 years

          -  Diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EULAR/PRINTO/PRES 2008, Ankara
             criteria for childhood Wegener's granulomatosis) or diagnosis of microscopic
             polyangiitis (according to the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference)

          -  Newly diagnosed patients or patients with relapsing disease according to the
             following definition:

        The recurrence or new onset of potentially organ- or life-threatening disease (i.e. one or
        more major BVAS/WG items as listed in the protocol or disease severe enough to require
        treatment with cyclophosphamide)

          -  For patients of reproductive potential (males and females), use of reliable means of
             contraception throughout the study participation

          -  For all eligible patients, mandatory prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis
             jirovecii infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome, as defined by the Chapel Hill consensus
             Conference (Jennette 1994)

          -  Limited disease that would not normally be treated with cyclophosphamide

          -  Severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation due to alveolar hemorrhage

          -  Requirement for plasmapheresis or dialysis at screening

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Evidence of other significant uncontrolled concomitant disease, or of disorder or
             condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude or interfere with
             patient participation

          -  Primary or secondary immunodeficiency (history of or currently active), including
             known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Known active infection of any kind (excluding fungal infections of nail beds), or any
             major episode of infection requiring hospitalization with IV anti-infective agents
             within 4 weeks of baseline or completion of oral anti-infective agents within 2 weeks
             prior to baseline

          -  History of deep space/tissue infection within 24 weeks prior to baseline

          -  History of serious recurrent or chronic infection

          -  History of cancer (except for basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that
             have been excised and cured)

          -  Currently active alcohol or drug abuse or history of alcohol or drug abuse

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a biologic agent or known
             hypersensitivity to any component of rituximab or to murine proteins

          -  Previous treatment with rituximab

          -  Previous treatment with any cell-depleting therapies

          -  Receipt of oral or IV cyclophosphamide within the previous 4 months prior to the
             baseline visit

          -  Receipt of infliximab within 3 months, adalimumab within 2 months or etanercept
             within 1 month prior to the baseline visit

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 28 days of baseline or 5 half-lives
             of the investigational drug (whichever is longer)
