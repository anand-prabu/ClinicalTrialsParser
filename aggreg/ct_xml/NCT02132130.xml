  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the current study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the potential
      ability of CGF166 delivered through IL-infusion to improve hearing and vestibular function.
      CGF166 is a recombinant adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector containing a cDNA encoding the human
      Atonal transcription factor (Hath1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of CGF166
      and the associated delivery procedures in patients with severe-to-profound bilateral hearing
      loss. Eligible patients are required to have documented, non-fluctuating hearing loss.  Part
      A will include a safety and tolerability cohort (N=3).  Patient dosing will be staggered;
      dosing the next patient in a cohort will be based on a safety review of all available data
      through 4 weeks post-dose of the previously dosed patient(s). Part B includes a volumetric
      escalation design to evaluate infusion volumes of the same CGF166 concentration (5.0 x
      10E11vp/mL) in 4 cohorts of patients (n=3/cohort; total of 12 patients). Part C is an
      expansion cohort of the highest safe and tolerable dose identified in Part B, for further
      assessment of efficacy.

             bilateral hearing loss with intact vestibular function in the non-operative ear.
             Non-fluctuating severe-to-profound hearing loss is required for the study ear and is
             defined as:

          2. Pure-tone average (PTA) within 10 dB of the PTA obtained at least 11 months
             previously

          3. Word recognition within 20% of previous test at least 11 months previously

          4. Hearing loss has been diagnosed within 10 years of the expected date of treatment

          5. Candidate ear (&quot;study ear&quot;) pure tone audiometric thresholds   of ≥70 dB HL for each
             testable octave frequency from 0.125 through 8 kHz and sentence recognition ≤50% at
             screening

          6. Contralateral ear (&quot;non-study ear&quot;): Despite use of a hearing aid meets cochlear
             implantation criteria. PTA over  0.5/1/2/4 kHz of ≥70 dB HL and ≤100 dB HL and
             sentence recognition test scores ≤60% at screening

          7. Patients with intact vestibular function in at least one ear (non-study ear) as
             measured by rotary chair vestibular-ocular reflex or caloric nystagmography, or
             vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP)

          8. MRI scan within 3 months or at screening to confirm suitability for inner ear surgery

          9. Ability to understand the study and provide informed consent; willingness to comply
             with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with hearing loss caused by genetic/developmental disorders, e.g., cochlea
             aplasia or autoimmune ear disease

          2. Patients with existing conductive hearing loss or mixed hearing loss

          3. Patients with cochlear implants or past cochlear implant in the candidate study ear

          4. Hearing loss  due to any other cause that would not be expected to respond to hair
             cell regeneration, for example mechanical trauma or central auditory lesions or lack
             of an auditory nerve

          5. Patients who will require ototoxic drugs as routine therapy over the course of the
             study, such as oncology patients on platinum-based chemotherapy

          6. Any contraindication to the planned surgery or anesthesia as determined by the
             surgeon or anesthesiologist

          7. Previous surgery in the study ear

          8. Any otological history, such as chronic otitis, cholesteatoma, tympanic membrane
             perforation, that suggests poor candidacy for cochlear implant or inner ear surgery
             or suggests potential interference with study auditory or vestibular function tests

          9. Pregnant women

         10. Abnormal vital signs and/or ECG that suggest potential contraindication for planned
             study anesthesia

         11. Past serious adverse reaction to anesthesia

         12. Meniere's Disease

         13. History of radiation therapy to the head and neck
