  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease (PD) is an inflammatory, infectious and destructive condition of the
      tissues surrounding the teeth. However, even if bacteria are required to initiate
      periodontal disease, the immune response is responsible for most of the destruction of the
      periodontal tissues. Statins may be used to control the immune response to periodontal
      pathogens, a factor that has not yet been managed clinically and even less massively.

      Recently it has been reported the pharmacological effectiveness of topically used statins.
      For periodontal disease, at least four well conducted clinical trials have been published
      using a topically statin formula for pocket irrigation in adult populations with chronic
      periodontal disease, observing surprising clinical results in all of them (with clinical and
      statistical significance) and no adverse reactions.

      The purpose of the present study is to develop statin (atorvastatin 2%) medicated toothpaste
      and evaluate its effectiveness, as complement to non-surgical conventional periodontal
      treatment. Clinical as well as molecular examination will be made at the beginning and after
      one month of treatment.

      An atorvastatin toothpaste 2% (2 mg x every 0.1 ml of toothpaste) will be prepared for
      dental brushing. It will be used as a base a fluoride toothpaste, to which will be added
      atorvastatin in the prescribed amount. Medicated prototypes and placebos will be dosed  in 5
      ml syringes indicating each 0.5 ml measures to facilitate dispensing the product and ensure
      proper use. Thus, each syringe will be for 10 doses of toothpaste (10 brushings). 6 syringes
      will be provided to each patient, so that they have enough for a month of treatment, during
      which they will have to brush 2 times a day.

      Sample size:

      A clinical trial with two parallel groups (1:1) will be conducted, where there will be 2
      groups of 19 patients each. The estimated sample size was based on the difference in level
      of integration achieved in the study 1.2 Goodson et al (Goodson JM, Haffajee AD, Socransky
      SS, Kent R, Teles R, Hasturk H, Bogren A, Van Dyke T, Wennstrom J, Lindhe J. Control of
      periodontal infections: A randomized   controlled trial I. The   primary   outcome
      attachment   gain and pocket   depth   reduction at Treated   sites. J Clin   Periodontol
      2012, 39: 526-536), with a power of 90%, a significance level of 0.05 two-tailed.

      Treatments and protocols:

      Study patients will be treated at the Department of Periodontology of the CESA, University
      of los Andes in San Bernardo.

      The two groups will undergo non-surgical periodontal therapy consisting of scaling and root
      planning of all tooth groups.

      Therapy will be supplemented with oral hygiene instruction, indicating patients to brush
      with the toothpaste that will be provided, 2 times a day for two minutes each time. Then
      they will be told to spit the toothpaste excesses during 30 seconds, but not to rinse their
      teeth, or consume liquids or solid foods for at least 30 minutes. A group of 19 patients
      will receive the atorvastatin toothpaste 2%, while the other group of 19 patients will
      receive toothpaste without the drug to act as a placebo.

      The record of the application of statins will be done by a professor at the Faculty of
      Dentistry, before periodontal clinical evaluation, in order not to influence the researcher.

      The allocation to each group will be random and there will be a sequence concealment.

      Analysis Plan:

      Continuous variables will be described with measures of central tendency, dispersion and
      position and dichotomous variables will be tabulated and described with absolute and
      relative frequencies according to group. To compare the continuous variables between groups
      an ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test will be used with a subsequent analysis of multiple
      comparisons. The effect of treatments will be explored through a multilevel linear
      regression model to evaluate the performance considering the non-independence of the
      measures at each site. The analysis will be performed with Stata software 11.

    <description>Two sites are selected in each quadrant whose PD is greater. After isolating the tooth in a relative way with cotton swabs, will proceed to the removal of supra-gingival plaque with curette without touching the gingival margin. The crevicular site will be dried gently with triple syringe air. FGC will be collected with paper cones. The paper points will be inserted in the pocket until feeling resistance and left there for 40 seconds. Cones contaminated with saliva or blood will be excluded. Later paper cones will be put into an Eppendorf tube. GCF samples will be stored under cold  at -80 ° C.
All samples will be sent for analysis to the Research Laboratory of the University of los Andes. These samples will be sent under a strictly pre-established protocol.
The following biomarkers of inflammation will be measured: IL-6, IL-10, MMP-8, C-reactive protein (CRP) both of R and D Systems ™. This will be through Elisa test.</description>
