Tranexamic acid is a synthetic drug that\n      has been shown to reduce blood drain output and the need for blood transfusions in both its\n      topical and intravenous forms and is commonly used in orthopedic surgery. We hypothesize\n      that IV and topical administration of tranexamic acid will be equally good at reducing the\n      loss of blood and the need for transfusion immediately following total knee replacement."
