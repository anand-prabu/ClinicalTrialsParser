  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Nevus doctor&quot; is a dermatoscopy based computer decision support tool to assist general
      practitioners (GPs) in the classification of pigmented skin lesions (PSLs). The aim of the
      program &quot;Nevus doctor&quot; is to help GPs increase their diagnostic accuracy, in particular
      regarding the selection of suspicious PSLs that need biopsy or referral to specialist health
      care for further assessment. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic
      performance of the decision support tool in a primary care setting in Norway. We hypothesize
      that the diagnostic accuracy of the computer program &quot;Nevus doctor&quot; is better than the
      performance of the GPs.

      In the trial GPs examine patients who attend a primary health care center. A given PSL is
      first assessed clinically by the GP and afterwards photographed. A clinical photograph as
      well as a dermatoscopic photograph is taken, the latter using a dermatoscope attached to the
      lens of the camera. The dermatoscopic image is then processed by the computer program. The
      performance of &quot;Nevus doctor&quot; is compared with the GPs' assessment. A dermatologist reviews
      all cases based on the clinical and dermatoscopic photographs and this assessment serves as
      the reference standard.

    <description>The computer program tests whether the appearance of a skin lesion is suggestive of skin cancer. There are two possible test outcomes: &quot;suspicious&quot; or &quot;not suspicious&quot;. The reference standard is the assessment done by a dermatologist. The number (and percentage) of skin lesions correctly classified as &quot;suspicious&quot; or &quot;not suspicious&quot; is reported. Furthermore sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values are calculated.</description>
