For sample size calculation we will consider the rate of nodal conversion from clinically node-positive (cLN+) before treatment to pathologic node-negative (pLN0) after the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who are clinically node positive (cLN+) will be evaluated for nodal response, i.e. conversion to pLN0 status. We assume that 30% of these patients will be predicted by the genomic predictor as responders (i.e. pLN0 status) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and that 70% of them will actually achieve pLN0 status. The study will be sized to have 80% power to detect observed response (pLN-negative) rates > 50% in cLN-positive patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a 95% confidence level (one sided). Probability will be measured in percent.",
