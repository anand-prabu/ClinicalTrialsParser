Randomisation\n      will be performed using a computer generated random numbers and sealed envelopes.\n\n      Full history will be taken followed by general and local examination. One hour before the\n      procedure all women will receive diclofenac 100mg (Voltaren@ Novartis Switzerland). The\n      procedure will be done in the lithotomy position. Hysteroscopy will be done using a 5mm\n      outer diameter continuous flow hysteroscope with a French working channel and a 30 degrees\n      direction of view provided by Techno GmbH and CO. The hysteroscope will be introduced using\n      the vaginoscopy technique, in which no speculum will be used. The cervix will be detected\n      and the external os will be identified using the hysteroscope. The hysteroscope will be\n      introduced in the uterine cavity. Saline will be used as the distension medium and the\n      pressure will be set at 80mm Hg until the hysteroscope is introduced in the uterine cavity.\n      After the hysteroscope is introduced into the uterine cavity, the filling pressure will\n      remain at 80mm Hg in group1, will be reduced to 50mm Hg in group 2 and to 40mmHg in group 3.\n      Randomisation will be double blind, neither the operator nor the patient will know the\n      pressure during the procedure, a third party will set the pressure according to the computer\n      generated random numbers. If the procedure cannot be completed, the operator will ask for\n      the pressure to be adjusted to 80mm Hg, which is the usual pressure used in Cairo university\n      hospitals, or more if needed. In this case the operator will document in the data collection\n      form that the procedure could not be completed with the pre-set pressure.\n\n      The anterior wall, posterior wall and tubal ostea will be visualised, any polyps, adhesions\n      septa, congenital malformations or submucous fibroids will be noted. Endometrial biopsy will\n      be taken using a semi-rigid, double action oval serrated biopsy forceps 40cm 50Charr Tecchno\n      medical GmbH.  The used scissor will be a single action semi-rigid rounded tip scissors\n      Tecchno medical GmbH."
