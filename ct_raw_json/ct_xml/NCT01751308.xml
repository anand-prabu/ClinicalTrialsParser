      Primary Objectives:

      Phase 1 Part:

      To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      cabazitaxel as a single agent in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid
      tumors including tumors of the central nervous system.

      Phase 2 Part:

      To determine the objective response rate (complete and partial response) and the duration of
      response to cabazitaxel as a single agent in patients with recurrent or refractory high
      grade glioma (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).

      Secondary Objectives:

      Phase 1 Part:

      To characterize the safety and tolerability of cabazitaxel in patients with recurrent or
      refractory solid tumors including tumors of the central nervous system.

      To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of cabazitaxel in patients with recurrent
      or refractory solid tumors including tumors of the central nervous system.

      To evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity that may be associated with cabazitaxel in
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors including tumors of the central nervous
      system.

      Phase 2 Part:

      To characterize the safety and tolerability of cabazitaxel in patients with recurrent or
      refractory HGG or DIPG.

      To estimate progression free survival in patients with recurrent or refractory HGG or DIPG.

      To estimate overall survival in patients with recurrent or refractory HGG or DIPG.

      To characterize the plasma PK profile of cabazitaxel in patients with recurrent or
      refractory HGG or DIPG.

    <description>Cabazitaxel will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Cycle administration will be repeated every 3 weeks. From an initial starting dose (dose level 1) the dose of cabazitaxel will be escalated during subsequent cycles until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be reached. Premedications will also be administered prior to each dose of cabazitaxel (antihistamine + steroid + H2 antagonist). Patients will start G-CSF or Peg G-CSF at least 24 hours after completion of the cabazitaxel infusion.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

        Phase 1 Part (dose escalation): Patients with a histologically confirmed solid tumor
        including tumors of the central nervous system that is recurrent or refractory and for
        which no further effective standard treatment is available. All patients must have
        measurable disease. Patients with diffuse pontine glioma are eligible without a biopsy
        after evidence of progressive disease post radiation therapy.

        Phase 2 Part (safety and activity): Patients with recurrent or refractory high grade
        glioma or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma for whom no further effective therapy is
        available. All patients must have measurable disease. Patients with diffuse pontine glioma
        are eligible without a biopsy after evidence of progressive disease post radiation
        therapy. Patients with a grade III or grade IV glioma must have pathologic conformation
        either at the time of initial diagnosis or at the time of recurrence.

        Patients aged ≥2 years and ≤18 years

        Patients should meet the body surface area (BSA) requirements to be eligible:

          1. Minimal BSA requirements for a particular dose level;

          2. During the Phase 1 part patients must have a BSA &lt; 2.1 m² at the time of enrollment

          3. During the Phase 2 part patients with a BSA ≥ 2.1 m² will be eligible, however the
             actual dose of cabazitaxel for these patients will be adjusted to a maximum dose
             calculated with (capped at) the BSA of 2.1 m²

        Performance status by:

          1. Lansky score ≥60 (patients ≤10 years of age)

          2. Karnofsky score ≥60% (patients &gt;10 years of age)

        Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are mobile in a wheelchair,
        will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score

        Patients must have adequate liver, renal and marrow function as defined below:

          1. Total bilirubin ≤1.0 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age

          2. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 x ULN

          3. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN for age or creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m²

          4. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0x109/L

          5. Platelets ≥75x109/L (transfusion independent)

          6. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL (can be transfused)

        Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test ≤ 7 days
        before starting cabazitaxel treatment.

        Male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate
        contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 6
        months following the last dose of cabazitaxel.

        Written informed consent/assent prior to any study-specific procedures. Consent must be
        obtained from the patient and/or parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the signature of at
        least one parent or guardian will be required. Investigators will also obtain assent of
        patients according to local, regional or national guidelines. Patients must have recovered
        from the acute toxic effects of all prior therapy to ≤ grade 1 before entering this study.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Prior treatment within the following timeframes:

          1. Systemic anti-cancer treatment within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin and
             monoclonal antibodies including bevacizumab)

          2. Surgery or smaller field radiation therapy within 4 weeks

          3. Treatment with an investigational agent within 4 weeks or within 5 half-lives of the
             agent, whichever is longer

        Craniospinal or other large field radiation therapy (defined as &gt;25% of bone marrow
        irradiated) within 6 months prior to the first dose.

        Prior systemic radioisotope therapy (this does not include diagnostic imaging or
        radioimmunoconjugates lacking myelosuppressive properties) or total body irradiation.

        Prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant

        Patients with any clinically significant illness that, in the investigator's opinion,
        cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, would compromise a patient's
        ability to tolerate cabazitaxel or result in inability to assess toxicity. This includes,
        but is not limited to uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active
        infection, cardiac disease, renal impairment, planned surgery or psychiatric
        illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

        Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency-syndrome
        (AIDS)-related disease

        Known history of hepatitis C or known active hepatitis B infection.

        Pregnant or breast feeding women

        Treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 or enzyme inducing
        anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) within 14 days prior to first dose of cabazitaxel and for the
        duration of study. Non-EIAEDs are permitted.

        Known history of hypersensitivity to taxanes or polysorbate 80 or G-CSF.

        Participation in another interventional clinical trial and/or concurrent treatment with
        any investigational drug.

        Patients not able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and
        other study procedures.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
