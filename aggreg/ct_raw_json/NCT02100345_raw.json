A subgroup of patients with\n      DIE has an infiltration into the rectosigmoid bowel wall (4-37%). Knowledge of the growth\n      pattern of rectosigmoid lesions related to subjective symptoms is mandatory in order to\n      assess the need for follow-up with transvaginal ultrasound during medical treatment.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n      Symptoms will follow growth of rectosigmoid endometriosis.\n\n      Material and methods:\n\n      Two different cohorts of women, based on time of diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis and\n      treatment with hormonal intrauterine device or continuous oral contraceptives will receive a\n      questionnaire and a transvaginal ultrasound scan (measuring size and volume) at inclusion,\n      (6) and 12 months later.\n\n      Perspectives:\n\n      Patients treated conservatively may be followed by questionnaires, thereby reducing the need\n      for time consuming clinical controls."
