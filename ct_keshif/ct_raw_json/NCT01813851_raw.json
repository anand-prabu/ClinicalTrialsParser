Physical activity has been shown to have numerous positive impacts in\n      pathologic conditions associated to end stage renal disease.\n\n      Concomitant prescription of physical activity and nutritional support might mutually enhance\n      the anabolic effects of these interventions and improve the rate of remission of PEW.\n\n      The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of a programmed, progressive endurance\n      training performed during the dialysis session on a cycle ergometer under the supervision of\n      a qualified trainer, on protein energy wasting and physical functioning of chronic\n      hemodialysis patients."
