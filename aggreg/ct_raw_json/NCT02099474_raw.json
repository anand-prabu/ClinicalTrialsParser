Principal objective\n\n                  -  To study pharmacokinetic properties of raltegravir in pregnant women infected\n                     by HIV-1, during the third trimester of pregnancy (between 30 and 37 weeks of\n                     amenorrhea) and 1 month after childbirth (between W4 and W6 postpartum), as\n                     well as in their neonate.\n\n             2. Secondary objectives\n\n                  -  Estimate the frequency of women receiving raltegravir and having indetectable\n                     viral load at delivery (and those having a strictly indetectable viral load,\n                     with no signal under the threshold of the technique used).\n\n                  -  Describe the tolerance to raltegravir in pregnant women during the third\n                     trimester and in her neonates\n\n        2. Methodology\n\n             -  National multicenter pharmacokinetic study conducted among pregnant women infected\n                by HIV-1 and exposed to raltegravir during pregnancy.\n\n        3. Statistical method\n\n             -  Method of population pharmacokinetic with 5 samples: before the drug intake, 0.5,\n                3, 8 and 12 hours after the intake at each of the 2 visits (between 30 and 37\n                weeks of amenorrhea, and 4 to 6 weeks after delivery)."
