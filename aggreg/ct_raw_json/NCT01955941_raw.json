            "textblock": "Despite having excellent local tumor control rates, uveal melanoma remains a\n      life-threatening cancer, and even eye-sparing therapy with radiation treatment often leads\n      to significant loss of vision. Major challenges to providing care to patients with uveal\n      melanoma include the inability to accurately predict long-term vision in an eye treated with\n      radiation, due to a poor understanding of the nature of radiation retinopathy and optic\n      neuropathy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a commonly used ophthalmic imaging\n      modality that provides precise, real-time data in vivo in a non-invasive manner. Our\n      research group has recently developed two novel functional OCT technologies: (1) Doppler OCT\n      to quantitatively measure total retinal flow and (2) OCT angiography technology to map optic\n      nerve head, retinal, and choroidal blood flow with unprecedented accuracy. The investigators\n      believe this technology can be utilized to improve understanding of radiation-induced\n      vascular changes in the optic nerve and retina that cause vision loss in patients treated\n      with radiation, as well as provide a tool to monitor tumor response to treatment.\n\n      In this study, the investigators intend to utilize these novel functional OCT technologies\n      to describe the changes over time in optic nerve head and retinal blood flow after I-125\n      radiation therapy, and to evaluate the relationship between changes in flow and decreased\n      vision. The investigators will also study the association between changes in flow and the\n      total radiation doses received by the optic nerve head and macula, which varies based upon\n      tumor location and size."
