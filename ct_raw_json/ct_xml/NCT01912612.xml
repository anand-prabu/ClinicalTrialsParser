  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early stage breast cancer is typically treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation
      therapy, and/or endocrine therapy. Following treatment, 25-60% of breast cancer survivors
      have reported chronic pain, which can be difficult to manage. Duloxetine is a serotonin
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is FDA approved for treatment of depression, anxiety,
      fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, knee arthritis, and low back pain.

      Pilot data suggest that duloxetine is effective in management of endocrine
      therapy-associated musculoskeletal pain, and a randomized placebo controlled trial of
      duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy for treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.
      In this crossover trial of duloxetine versus placebo, we will investigate the change in pain
      sensitivity with treatment in order to evaluate both why duloxetine is effective for
      management of pain for some patients, as well as predictors of who is likely to benefit from
      tamoxifen. A total of 160 women with early stage breast cancer who have chronic pain
      following treatment, as well as 40 women who are pain free, will be enrolled. All subjects
      will undergo assessment of pain sensitivity and complete questionnaires. Subjects with pain
      will be treated with duloxetine followed by placebo, or the same treatments in the reverse
      order, with pain sensitivity assessments before and following each treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained from the patient before the initiation of any
             study-specific procedures

          2. Female patients at least 25 years of age

          3. Diagnosis of stage 0-III breast cancer within 8 years prior to enrollment. All
             indicated surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy must have been completed at

             permitted.

          4. Pain that developed or worsened since breast cancer diagnosis and is not due to
             identifiable traumatic event or fracture

          5. Patient-reported average pain score between 4 and 10 (inclusive) on a 0-10 scale
