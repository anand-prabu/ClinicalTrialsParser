Bydureon is a recently approved long\n      acting form of Exenatide. Because of the lack of safety data for Bydureon in children, we\n      propose to conduct the trial in adults (>18 yrs.).\n\n      Both the subject and the study personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment. The\n      randomization will be done, 1;1, by the coordinating site (at Yale). As a secondary\n      analysis, we propose to determine whether the presence of residual insulin production\n      modifies the drug effect. To do this, we plan to stratify patients for randomization on the\n      basis of detectable C-peptide levels. We will therefore wait for the results of the\n      C-peptide levels from the enrollment MMTT prior to randomization. The study investigators\n      will not be told in which stratum the patient is being randomized and will be blinded to the\n      C-peptide results of the MMTT until the conclusion of the study."
