Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a new non invasive method to modify\n      brain activation has shown good efficacy in the treatment of pain especially in the clinical\n      context. Given the fact that dyspnea has many common characteristics with pain, especially\n      concerning the brain areas involved in its central processing, we hypothesize that tDCS may\n      also modify the perception of dyspnea. In order to test this, we first shall determine\n      whether tDCS has a significant effect on acutely induced dyspnea in healthy volunteers. In\n      case of promising results of this pilot study, the next step will be the evaluation of the\n      benefit of tDCS in patients with severe dyspnea."

For each study group, the effect of tDCS on dyspnea perception and on\n      respiratory parameters will be compared between 2 active (anodal and cathodal) and a sham\n      tDCS stimulation (placebo)."
