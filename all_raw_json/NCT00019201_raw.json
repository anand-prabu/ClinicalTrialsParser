Visualized tissue is classified as either normal, abnormal, or\n      suspicious. Abnormal or suspicious tissue is biopsied, as is tissue from 1 or 2 randomly\n      chosen normal sites. Immunohistochemical analysis of the biopsy material is conducted\n      without knowledge of the bronchoscopic results. Patients unable to produce a sputum sample\n      prior to bronchoscopy are required to do so after bronchoscopy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be entered."
