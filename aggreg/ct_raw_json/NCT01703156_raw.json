Clopidogrel will be taken for at least one month and ideally up to one year. Sublingual nitroglycerin will be provided to all patients. Other anti-ischemic medications including long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and ranolazine may be provided at the treating physicians' discretion. If a patient has contraindications to any medications, they will not be administered. If a statin contraindication exists, other cholesterol-lowering medications may be administered.

Though guidelines recommend stress testing to manage low\n      risk ACS patients, evidence supporting this recommendation is not based on trials examining\n      this population. A well-designed, randomized trial is warranted to determine if stress\n      testing is useful in managing low risk ACS. If medical therapy alone is equivalent as the\n      investigators hypothesize, healthcare expenditures could be reduced and patients may not be\n      exposed to the harms associated with more invasive cardiac testing such as coronary\n      angiography."
