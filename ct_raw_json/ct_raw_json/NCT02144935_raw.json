The data generated in this study will come from surveys, interviews, review of\n      medical records, and physical examinations.\n\n      Data from this study will be utilized to guide future clinical trials for children with an\n      acute case of Transverse Myelitis. Parents and children separately will fill out an online\n      data base with 7 banks of surveys, each bank of survey topics have 7-10 questions. We will\n      have both the parent and child fill out at time of symptom onset,  and three time points to\n      follow, 3, 6, and 12 months post symptom onset.\n\n      A small subset of patients filling out the data registry will be able to travel to 1 of 5\n      treating TM centers; Children's Medical center Dallas, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,\n      Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, CA), Kennedy Krieger Institute, Johns Hopkins\n      university for a physical examination highlighting recovery from Transverse Myelitis."
