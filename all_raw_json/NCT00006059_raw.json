Blood specimens are also collected.\n\n      Linkage analysis is performed on specimens and analysis of shared marker alleles are used to\n      identify genomic regions likely or unlikely to contain the epilepsy genes.  Genotypes in\n      family members are determined at microsatellite markers throughout the genome.  Markers\n      tested include chromosomes linked to human epilepsy syndromes (6p, 8p, 8q, 20q, 21q) and\n      chromosome 3 (similar to mouse \"epilepsy\" genes).  Linkage to markers on chromosome 10q are\n      also tested.\n\n      Patients do not receive the results of the testing and the results do not influence the type\n      and duration of any treatment."
