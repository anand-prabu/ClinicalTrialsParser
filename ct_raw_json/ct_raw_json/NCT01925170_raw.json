The purpose of\n      this study is to see if MBI using a low dose of gamma radiation can find cancers not seen on\n      mammography.\n\n      Hypotheses: 1. Low-Dose MBI has a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity and equal\n      or higher positive predictive value than SM in women age 40 and older with mammographically\n      dense breasts. 2. Low-dose MBI has comparable sensitivity and specificity to that previously\n      achieved with MBI using a higher dose of radiation.  3. MBI produces a low false positive\n      rate (specificity >90%) that permits its use as a screening tool in this patient population."

After implementing radiation dose reduction\n      techniques, the performance of incident SM and prevalent screen MBI in women with dense\n      breasts will be compared.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Women presenting for SM with heterogeneously or extremely dense breast on past prior SM were\n      enrolled and underwent digital SM and MBI.  MBI was performed with 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi\n      and dual-head cadmium zinc telluride detectors. SMs were read independently; MBIs were read\n      in comparison with SM.  MBIs were assigned an assessment score of 1-5 which parallels\n      BI-RADS; scores of 3-5 on MBI were considered positive."
