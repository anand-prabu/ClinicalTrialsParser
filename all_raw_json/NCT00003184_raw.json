Vaccinations are administered every 2 weeks\n      for 6 weeks and then monthly for 3 months. Patients may receive 1 of 2 different doses of\n      GM-CSF. GM-CSF is administered with the vaccination, then every 12 hours for 7 days. Monthly\n      vaccinations may continue as long as response is shown.\n\n      Cohorts of 5 patients each are treated at each dose/combination. Each cohort completes\n      treatment before the next cohort is accrued.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 4 and 8, then every 2 months for 6 months, then every 3\n      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18\n      months."
