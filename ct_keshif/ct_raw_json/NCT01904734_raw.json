This study will compare testosterone responses to clomiphene citrate in male\n      veterans with hypothalamic hypogonadism na\u00efve to treatment with responses of similar\n      patients already receiving treatment with injectable or transdermal testosterone. This is an\n      open-label, prospective, interventional trial to be conducted in an outpatient specialty\n      care setting. We will randomize 64 hypogonadal male veterans evenly divided between naive\n      and previous treatment and treat for 8 weeks with clomid, increasing the initial dose of 25\n      mg to 50 mg/day in those who fail to achieve target testosterone level (450 ng/dl) after the\n      first 3 weeks. Endpoint measurements performed in the Phoenix VA Health Care System (PVAHCS)\n      clinical laboratory will be total testosterone as well as bioavailable testosterone and sex\n      hormone binding globulin. Total testosterone level at 8 weeks of treatment will be reported\n      as the primary endpoint. Safety measures (CBC,liver functions, PSA) will be assessed at 8\n      weeks as well. This study will help serve as a guide for design of future studies of\n      clomiphene in hypogonadal men."
