  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cells (DCs) are the professional antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. As
      such they are currently used in clinical vaccination protocols in cancer patients, and both
      immunological and clinical responses have been observed. Several subsets of dendritic cells
      have been characterized in the peripheral blood. One such subset is referred to as
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC). To date PDC have not been evaluated for their capability
      to induce anti-tumor immune responses in patients. For this reason the investigators will
      perform a safety and efficacy study with PDC in stage IV melanoma patients.
