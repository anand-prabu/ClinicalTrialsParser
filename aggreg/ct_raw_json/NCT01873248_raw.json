            "textblock": "In this study, we propose to use a well-established PET isotope, 68-Gallium (68Ga), bound to\n      a somatostatin analogue, DOTA-octreotate, or DOTATATE, which has high affinity for the\n      somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2). Most gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) NETs express SSTR2\n      on their cell surfaces; when the radiolabeled SSTR2 analogue binds to these receptors, the\n      radioactive molecule is internalized and transported to the tumor cell nucleus, thus\n      concentrating the radioactivity and improving the signal-to-noise ratio on the PET scan,\n      particularly as the background rapidly clears. This internalization, combined with the\n      improved physical principles of PET imaging, shorter half-life of the 68Ga (68 minutes vs.\n      about three days for 111In), improved radiation dosimetry, faster scanning, and lower cost\n      results in a greatly improved scan for diagnosis, staging and restaging of NET disease\n      compared to conventional 111In-octreotide imaging. Additionally, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT\n      scanning can be performed in 1.5 hours from injection of the radiopharmaceutical to\n      completion of the scan, vs. 2-3 days for 111In-octreotide imaging."
