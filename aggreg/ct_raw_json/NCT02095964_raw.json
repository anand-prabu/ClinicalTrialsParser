HDL-C\n      promotes  endothelial  generation  of  nitric  oxide  (NO)  and  improves  endothelial\n      function  and  arterial  vasoreactivity[11].   In  several  studies,  lower  HDL-C  level\n      was  reported  to  be  associated  with  increased  coronary  artery  disease (CAD)\n      risk[12-14].  HDL-C  also  has  anti- inflammatory  and  anti-oxidant  activities[15,16].\n      Concerning  anti-inflammatory  activity,  HDL-C  inhibits  the  activation  of\n      monocytes/macrophages  and  neutrophils[17,18]  and  inhibits  the  expression  of\n      endothelial  adhesion  molecules,  such  as  vascular  cell  adhesion  molecule-1  (VCAM-1)\n      and  E-selectin[15].\n\n      In   this   study   we   aimed  to  investigate  the  relation  of  HDL-C  level  with\n      systemic  inflammatory  markers  in  patients  with  cardiac  syndrome  X (CSX)."
