  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a relatively common procedure in pediatric patients
      undergoing evaluation for various gastrointestinal ailments.  The procedure itself, with or
      without associated biopsies, is relatively short in length.  Unlike adults, who regularly
      undergo this procedure with conscious sedation, children most often require general
      anesthesia. While safe and effective, endotracheal tracheal tube (ETT) intubation of
      children for EGD can result in delayed awakening and slow room turnover, particularly when
      intravenous medications are required for intubation.  Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is an
      alternative to intubation, which permits removal before full awakening.

      Although considered a safe alternative to tracheal intubation in appropriate cases,
      disadvantages of the LMA have been reported including kinking, occluding view of the
      surgical field, failure of placement requiring tracheal intubation, aspiration of gastric
      contents, desaturation, and laryngospasm. The study was designed to determine whether use of
      an LMA for EGD could reduce operating room time, while providing satisfactory conditions for
      the endoscopist, and an equivalent side effect and safety profile as compared to ETT in
      otherwise healthy children with gastrointestinal complaints
