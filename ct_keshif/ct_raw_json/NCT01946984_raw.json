The effect of diclofenac in prevention of that complication, was measured by the number\n           of patients who developed pancreatitis, and compare it with the placebo.\n\n        4. The investigators collected 199 patients, 17 excluded, 182 completed the study, all of\n           them underwent the intervention called \"ERCP\", and randomized to have either Diclofenac\n           or Placebo before the procedure."
