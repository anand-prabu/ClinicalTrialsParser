Evaluate the performance\n      of the GliaSite RTS in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients undergo surgical resection of\n      the tumor followed by surgical placement of the GliaSite device in the resection cavity. One\n      to 2 weeks after surgery, patients receive brachytherapy consisting of an infusion of iodine\n      I-125. The I-125 solution is removed and collected 5-7 days later. The device is surgically\n      removed within 24 hours. Patients are followed at 24 hours, 14 days, and 1 year post device\n      removal.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
