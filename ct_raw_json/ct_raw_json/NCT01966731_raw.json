Based on that\n      information, the longer-term goal is to make hydroxyurea more widely available for children\n      with SCA in Africa, particularly those identified with SCA through expanded newborn\n      screening programs."

To monitor the safety of hydroxyurea therapy, specifically documenting hematological\n           toxicities (cytopenias) and serious infections (bacterial and malarial)\n\n        3. To evaluate the benefits of hydroxyurea therapy, using both laboratory (e.g., fetal\n           hemoglobin, hemoglobin, white blood cell count) and clinical parameters (e.g., pain,\n           hospitalization, growth)\n\n        4.
