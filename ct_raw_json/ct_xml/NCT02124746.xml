  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study is to determine the long-term safety and tolerability of momelotinib
      in previously enrolled study participants with primary myelofibrosis (PMF),
      post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (post-PV MF), post-essential thrombocythemia
      myelofibrosis (post-ET MF), polycythemia vera (PV), or essential thrombocythemia (ET), who
      have tolerated and achieved stable disease or better with momelotinib treatment while
      enrolled in a previous clinical trial.

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from the first dose of momelotinib on the previous study until the first documentation of definitive progressive disease or death due to any cause.
Progressive disease for Cohorts 1 &amp; 2 is defined as leukemic transformation, increase in peripheral blood blast for at least 8 weeks, or progressive splenomegaly.
Progressive disease for Cohort 3 is defined as the interval from the first dose of momelotinib on the previous study until transformation into post-PV MF, post-ET MF, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute leukemia, or PV (for the ET subgroup).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Duration of splenic response is defined as the interval from the first onset of splenic response (in the previous study or this study) to loss of splenic response for ≥ 4 weeks or death from any cause.
Splenic response is defined as:
&gt; 50% reduction in palpable splenomegaly of a spleen that is ≥ 10 cm below the left costal margin (LCM) at baseline or
a spleen becomes not palpable, that is palpable at &gt; 5 cm below the LCM at baseline</description>

    <measure>Duration of transfusion independence response (Cohorts 1 and 2 only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Duration of transfusion independence response is defined as the interval from the first onset date of transfusion independence (in the previous study or this study) to the earliest onset date of transfusion dependence or death from any cause for participants who are transfusion dependent at baseline.
Transfusion independence is defined as absence of RBC transfusions for ≥ 8 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of anemia response (Cohorts 1 and 2 only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Duration of anemia response is defined as the interval from the first onset of anemia response to the earliest date of loss of anemia response which persists for at least 4 weeks, or death from any cause
Anemia response is defined as:
≥ 2g/dL increase in hemoglobin, if transfusion independent and with hemoglobin level of &lt; 10g/dL at baseline
Achieving transfusion independence for ≥ 8 weeks, if transfusion dependent at baseline</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (Cohort 3 only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Confirmed and unconfirmed overall response rate (ORR) are defined as:
Confirmed ORR: proportion of participants with onset of response in the previous study with the 12 week confirmation reached during this study
Unconfirmed ORR: proportion of participants with PV or ET with onset of response in the previous study that lasts for at least 4 weeks</description>
