Representatives within Head Start will be asked to participate in a nationwide\n      internet based survey identifying the amount and type of services provided within this area.\n       The Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) will also be included in the study by identifying\n      current use of the model and how it can be utilized in the future. In order to complete this\n      study to the fullest extent, we must begin by defining the Model of Human Occupation as well\n      as understanding the mission of the National Head Start Association.  The vision of MOHO is\n      to support practice that is focused on occupation, client centered, holistic,\n      evidence-based, and complementary to other occupational therapy models.  The mission of the\n      National Head Start Association is to coalesce, inspire and support the Head Start field as\n      a leader in early childhood development and education. This has lead researchers to perform\n      the following study:  An examination of occupational therapy in the context of Head Start."

Within the initial email introduction/invitation of participation, participants will\n      be given the name and contact information of the research assistants and will be instructed\n      to direct all questions regarding the survey to them. All data received from the survey\n      participants will be returned de-identified. None of the data collected will be traceable to\n      the survey participants. Participants will be provided the research assistants' email\n      addresses and can contact them should they be interested in receiving any results from the\n      study. The benefits of the study are to advance the overall role of Occupational Therapy\n      services within head start facilities.  This study could further understandings of how and /\n      or why certain concepts should / shouldn't be used, could assist administrators in\n      developing quality programming, and contribute to the body of knowledge in Occupational\n      Therapy in Head Start programs. The research assistants' e-mail addresses will be provided\n      in the consent forms with a statement saying that they will be able to contact her via\n      e-mail should they be interested in receiving any results from the study.Informed consent\n      will be obtained through the initial email introduction and formal request for\n      participation.
