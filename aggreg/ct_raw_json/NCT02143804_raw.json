            "textblock": "The plan is to study the safety and efficacy of CG0070 in high-grade NMIBC patients who\n      failed BCG therapy. Most patients with NMIBCis (Cis, Cis with Ta and/or T1, high grade Ta or\n      T1 with frequent or uncontrolled recurrences) who have failed BCG intravesical therapy\n      (standard of care) usually have no other choice but to proceed to cystectomy. Cystectomy is\n      a surgery associated with major morbidity, mortality and quality of life issues. Morbidity\n      and long term tedious medical care will be for the rest of the patient's life span. Most\n      patients at this stage do not show signs of disease progression into the muscle layer or of\n      metastasis, making surgery a very difficult decision. CG0070, if successful in this trial,\n      will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this patient population in need. For the\n      present study, Cis or Cis with Ta and/or T1 patients can only be enrolled if they have\n      failed the BOND study and are medically unfit for surgery. Furthermore, patients with high\n      grade Ta or T1 disease who have failed both BCG and chemotherapy treatments are also prone\n      to disease progression. Since these patients are not eligible to be enrolled in the BOND\n      trial, the present study will serve as an alternative to access CG0070 experimental\n      treatment."
