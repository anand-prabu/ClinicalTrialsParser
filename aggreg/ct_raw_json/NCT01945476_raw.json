            "textblock": "Normally, higher levels of preoperational stress or anxiety affect behavior and recovery\n      after the operation. Moreover, patients undergoing mastectomy are usually young women, and\n      this demographic is known to experience higher levels of stress and anxiety than any other.\n      Anesthetizing patients involves more than just anesthesia in operation; it also includes all\n      of the preoperative treatments for optimizing a patient's condition and promoting quick\n      postoperative recovery. Pharmacological premedication for anxiolysis or amnesia before\n      anesthesia has been a common means of sedation that many studies have investigated. However,\n      such studies have focused on alleviating patients' anxiety and on how far patients can obey\n      induction for sedation; there has been no research on post-operational prognoses, the\n      ultimate purpose of reducing anxiety.\n\n      The well-known effect of pharmacological premedication is to reduce the capacity of the\n      anesthetic. However, it is not confirmed whether this effect leads to better recovery after\n      anesthesia, as this question has not been researched. Furthermore, recently some have argued\n      strongly that premedication actually prolongs recovery and that it does not need to be\n      applied to every patient. Recently, therefore, the use of pharmacological premedication has\n      been left to the discretion of institutes or doctors in many cases.\n\n      Among types of premedication, midazolam belongs to the class of short-acting benzodiazepines\n      and is frequently used, as it induces meaningful anterograde amnesia and causes fewer\n      aftereffects such as respiratory problems. In addition, its effects have already been\n      demonstrated. However, research on the improvement of functional health after\n      anesthesia\u2014i.e., patients' quick return to normal life\u2014is still poor and needs to be\n      advanced.\n\n      When measuring the degree of recovery, recent studies tend to focus on measuring how quickly\n      patients are able to return to normal life rather than the recovery of specific symptoms. To\n      this end, the most widely used method is the Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) survey. It has\n      a total of 40 items, which are classified into five categories: emotional state, physical\n      comfort, psychological support, physical independence, and pain. Questions are answered\n      using a 5-point scale, with 1 being worst and 5 being best. It takes 6.3 minutes on average\n      to complete, and its test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and split-half\n      coefficient have led it to be recognized as the most effective survey method. Moreover, it\n      has been used in many studies investigating how the type of operation, method of anesthesia,\n      additional medication, and gender affect anesthesia and the operation. Its validity for such\n      research has been verified.\n\n      Therefore, investigators can investigate the degree of postoperational functional recovery\n      through the QoR-40 by comparing cases in which an operation is performed with or without\n      midazolam."
