            "textblock": "Whole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) is a novel, non-pharmacological intervention aimed at\n      improving muscle strength and endurance as well as bone density.  It holds promise for\n      children with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since muscle\n      weakness results not only from muscle breakdown but also physical inactivity and muscle\n      disuse atrophy.  Weak DMD patients may increasingly limit their physical activity due to\n      fear of falling or loss of independence (e.g. difficulty rising to stand without\n      assistance).  Prolonging the length of time boys with DMD are ambulatory is important for\n      delaying complications of this disease (lung hypoventilation, scoliosis) as well as\n      maintaining bone health. We propose to conduct a pilot study of WBVT in young boys with\n      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).  The primary outcome will be to document safety and\n      feasibility of WBVT in this patient population.  The secondary outcomes will evaluate\n      changes in muscle strength and endurance. Bone health will also be examined as part of\n      routine clinical care.  The study will include 20 ambulatory boys with DMD; patients will be\n      randomized (1:1 allocation) into 2 groups: WBVT treatment or no WBVT treatment (controls).\n      Treatment groups will consist of 10 boys undergoing daily WBVT in an 8-week, open-label\n      trial."
