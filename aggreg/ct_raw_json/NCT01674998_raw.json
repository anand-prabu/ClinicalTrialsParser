Researchers believe that early\n      identification of these disorders could lead to treatments to prevent, delay, or slow the\n      development of one of more of these diseases. Some people with REM sleep behavior disorder\n      (RBD) may go on to develop Parkinson's disease or another related neurological disorder, but\n      many do not."
