    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of human-derived
      antithrombin III (AT-III [Human]) supplementation prior to high-risk, non-emergency, cardiac
      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).  A total of 404 adult subjects undergoing CPB who
      have a baseline level of antithrombin activity less than 80% will be randomized to receive
      either AT-III (Human) or placebo.

    <description>Major morbidity composite defined as a composite of any one or more of the following:
Postoperative mortality (deaths occurring within 30 days of the operation or occurring during the primary hospitalization).
Stroke (clinical diagnosis of focal or global neurological deficit of abrupt onset caused by disturbance in cerebral blood supply).
Acute kidney injury (increase of serum creatinine levels to &gt;2.0 mg/dL and twice the baseline level or a new requirement for dialysis postoperatively).
Surgical reexploration (return to operating room because of bleeding, tamponade, graft occlusion or other cardiac reason).
Arterial or venous thromboembolic event (perioperative myocardial or mesenteric infarction, peripheral thromboembolism, acute coronary graft thrombosis, intracardiac thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism).
Prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hours).
Infection (deep sternal-wound infection and/or bloodstream infections).</description>

    <description>AT-III (Human) is an antithrombin concentrate prepared from pooled human plasma.  AT-III (Human) is provided as a freeze-dried preparation for intravenous use.  The AT-III (Human) preparation is reconstituted in 10 or 20 mL of sterile water for injection prior to intravenous administration.</description>

             bypass graft + valve), double/triple valve repair/replacement, ascending aorta/aortic
             arch surgeries. Isolated coronary bypass graft and single valve repair/replacements
             are allowed only if subject has received preoperative heparin &gt;2 days.

          -  Subject has a baseline AT level of less than 80%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject needs emergency surgery.

          -  Subject needs heart transplantation.

          -  Use of minimally invasive surgery.

          -  Previous cardiac operation.

          -  Infective endocarditis.

          -  Thromboembolic events, stroke, or ST-elevated myocardial infarction within 7 days of
             surgery.

          -  Cardiogenic shock at the time of surgery.

          -  Renal dysfunction: Creatinine levels &gt;2 mg/dL or chronic dialysis.

          -  Liver dysfunction: aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase increase ≥2-fold
             above the upper-limit of local lab normal ranges.

          -  Treatment with Clopidogrel and Ticagrelor within 5 days before surgery, Prasugrel
             within 7 days before surgery, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockers within 24 hours
             of surgery.

          -  Treatment with new oral anticoagulants (Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Dabigatran) within 48
             hours before surgery.

          -  Vitamin K antagonist therapy and an international normalized ratio &gt;1.3 on the day of
             surgery.

          -  Platelet count &lt;120,000/μL.

          -  History or suspicion of a congenital or acquired coagulation disorder.
