    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate how the body responds to evacetrapib and to
      evaluate the safety and the effect of evacetrapib, alone and in combination with selected
      statins, in healthy Chinese participants. The study has 2 parts.  Part one will last up to 4
      weeks and part two will last up to 5 weeks, not including screening.  Participants may only
      enroll in one part.
