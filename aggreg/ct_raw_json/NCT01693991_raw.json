Full-study research questions:\n      Primary: Does adding the MMi to usual care (experimental group or EG) enhance meaning in\n      life among newly diagnosed ACP, compared with those receiving usual care plus meetings with\n      an empathic non-professional visitor (i.e., attention-control group or AC) or usual care\n      alone (UC), at x months post-randomization? (time determined in pilot) \"Meaning in life\"\n      (primary outcome) is defined as the belief that one's life has significance and purpose\n      (i.e., global meaning) and \"newly diagnosed ACP\" is defined as the 6 months after first\n      occurrence of, progression toward, or recurrence of stage III or IV cancer (TNM\n      classification system). Secondary: In our future full-study, we plan to evaluate MMi effects\n      on secondary outcomes such as existential wellbeing (MQOL existential wellbeing) and\n      posttraumatic growth (Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory). We also plan to test a theoretical\n      model where sense of meaning in life has a protective (moderating) effect on tertiary\n      outcomes such as physical QoL (MQOL physical subscale), anxiety and depression (Hospital\n      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), and overall QoL (MQOL Total) in EG patients.\n      Methodology: RCT pilot study with 60 newly diagnosed ACP (stages III or IV) within 2 months\n      of referral and 6 months of randomization, assigned randomly to: (1) EG, (2) AC, or (3) UC.\n      Patients will complete self-report questionnaires (including outcome measures, as well as\n      sociodemographic and medical variables) at 2, 4 and 6 months post-randomization."
