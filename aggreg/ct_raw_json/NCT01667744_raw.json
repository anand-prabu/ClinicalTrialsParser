In\n      addition, behavioral treatment of emotional distress is known to decrease symptoms, and\n      treatment usage.  The present protocol tests whether the addition of a medication known to\n      reduce emotional distress can also reduce symptoms and treatment usage.\n\n      This will done by recruiting patients with ACS during their hospital stay, randomizing them\n      to receive citalopram or placebo, and then examining their symptoms and treatment usage at 6\n      months."
