  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in strategies of hemiparetic upper limb
      movement in chronic stroke patients following rehabilitation using the &quot;Nintendo Wii&quot;. The
      investigators hypothesize that patients will increase their use of compensatory strategies
      following this rehabilitation.

      The principal aim of this study is to evaluate changes in strategies of hemiparetic upper
      limb movement in chronic stroke patients following twelve one hour sessions of
      rehabilitation using the &quot;Nintendo Wii&quot; over a period of four weeks, and to compare with a
      group of patients receiving traditional upper limb rehabilitation of the same duration. The
      investigators hypothesize that the use of compensatory strategies will increase in the group
      receiving the &quot;Wii&quot; rehabilitation while they will decrease in the group receiving
      traditional rehabilitation. The investigators further hypothesize that this will have an
      impact on the functional benefit with a greater improvement of function in the group
      receiving traditional rehabilitation.
