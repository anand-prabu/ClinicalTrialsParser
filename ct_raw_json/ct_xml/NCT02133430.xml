    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the difference of incidence of postoperative
      delirium between patients received general anesthesia guided  by Bispectral index (BIS)  and
      patients received general anesthesia using standard technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia is one of precipitating factor of postoperative delirium which Its
      mechanism is still unknown. General anesthesia can affect on pattern of
      electroencephalograph. Previous studies showed that patients received BIS guided anesthesia
      could wake up faster, earlier extubation and stay in recovery room shorter compared to
      standard general anesthesia. Optimized level of  anesthesia by BIS could reduce cognitive
      dysfunction in elderly patients and reduce biological marker of brain injury. Therefore, the
      investigators hypothesized that adjustment of general anesthesia by BIS guided could protect
      central nervous system and reduce incidence of postoperative delirium.
