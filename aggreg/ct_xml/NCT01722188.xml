  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, actively monitored, long term data collection registry.
      Any Patient that receives a market released St. Jude Medical (SJM) Optim lead and a
      compatible market released cardia rhythm management (CRM) implantable pulse generator is
      eligible for enrollment into the registry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are enrolled in the registry up to 180 days post implantation of an Optim lead.
      Patients with Optim™ ICD leads and Quicksite®/Quickflex®/Quickflex® µ/Quartet® LV leads are
      followed indefinitely following enrollment. Patients with other Optim leads are followed for
      a period of 60 months after Optim™ lead implantation.  The follow-up plan for this registry
      is based on the established follow-up practices currently used by each of the respective
      registry centers. Patients are followed according to the center's standard follow-up
      schedule.

      At each office/clinic follow-up visit standard electrical measurements are collected. During
      system revision in a patient with either Optim™ ICD leads, Quicksite®, Quickflex®,
      Quickflex® µ or Quartet® LV lead, cinefluoroscopy (AP, LAO 45° or the best possible LAO
      view, RAO 45° or the best possible RAO view) should be performed at specific study sites.
      If cinefluoroscopy or chest X-ray is performed according to the site's standard of care then
      copies of those should be submitted.
