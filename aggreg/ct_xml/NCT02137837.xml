      This randomized Phase III trial studies how well the combination of fulvestrant and
      everolimus together or the combination of anastrozole, fulvestrant and everolimus together,
      improve progression-free survival (PFS) versus  fulvestrant alone.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To test the benefit of interfering with the function of the estrogen receptor (ER) and
           providing downstream target inhibition (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) with a combination of optimal
           dose fulvestrant and everolimus (Arm 2) to improve progression-free survival compared
           to the optimal dose fulvestrant alone (Arm 1).

        -  To test the benefit of adding the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor anastrozole to
           optimal dose fulvestrant and everolimus (Arm 3) in order to improve progression free
           survival over optimal dose fulvestrant (Arm 1).

      Secondary

        -  To compare progression-free survival among those receiving fulvestrant + everolimus +
           anastrozole (Arm 3) versus fulvestrant + everolimus (Arm 2).

        -  To compare overall survival among the treatment arms in post-menopausal patients with
           hormone-receptor positive (HR+) Stage IV breast cancer.

        -  To assess and compare toxicities, feasibility and compliance among the study regimens.

        -  To compare response rates and clinical benefit rates among the study regimens.

        -  To test molecular determinants of response to endocrine therapy and everolimus in
           circulating tumor cells:

             1. CTC-Endocrine Therapy Index (CTC ETI) on the CellSearch® platform.

             2. CTC-Next Generation Sequencing Analysis (CTC-NGS) of single cells captured on the
                HD-CTC® platform.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a multicenter study. Patients will be stratified according to the following factors:

        -  Measurable versus evaluable non-measurable disease

        -  Prior adjuvant hormonal therapy completed more than 5 years ago vs. prior adjuvant
           hormonal therapy completed 1-5 years ago vs. de novo presentation of metastatic disease
           or no prior adjuvant hormonal therapy.

      ARMS:

        -  Arm 1: fulvestrant + placebo (everolimus) + placebo (anastrozole)

        -  Arm 2: fulvestrant + everolimus + placebo (anastrozole)

        -  Arm 3: fulvestrant + everolimus + anastrozole

      Blood and tissue samples are collected for correlative science studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then yearly thereafter for 5 years.

             epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2), for whom endocrine therapy is planned.

          -  The HER-2 test result is negative (and should be reported as such), if  a single test
             (or all tests)performed in a tumor specimen show:

               -  Immunohistochemistries (IHC) 1+ negative or IHC 0 negative or

               -  in situ hybridization (ISH) negative using a single probe ISH or dual probe ISH.

          -  Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) positivity must be assessed
             according to American Society of Clinial Oncology (ASCO)/College of American

             HER2 IHC is 2+, an evaluation for gene amplification must be performed and the gene
             must not be amplified. Gene amplification evaluation is not required if evaluation by
             IHC is 0 or 1+ by institutional standards.
