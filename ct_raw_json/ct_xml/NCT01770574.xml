      The purpose of this study is to determine whether artificial bone graft (ReproBone™)
      provides equally good results compared to autologous bone graft from the iliac crest and
      reduces postoperative pain.

      To groups of patients (age 5-16) will be compared. One group randomized to autologous bone
      graft and the other group randomized to ReproBone™.

      The evaluation will be based on pedobarography, Patient reported outcome assessment (Oxford
      Ankle Foot Questionnaire), pain (measured by visual analog scale) and radiographic stereo
      assay.

      Study C: HA-β TCP (ReproBone™) vs. autologous iliac crest bone graft in a calcaneal
      lengthening osteotomy in children with hindfoot valgus. A clinical randomized controlled
      study with 12 months of follow-up.

      Purpose. To investigate the clinical and radiographic findings of a calcaneal lengthening
      osteotomy by comparing autologous bonegraft and HA-β-TCP graft in a group of children with
      hindfoot valgus deformities. The primary outcome measure is pain score (visual analog
      scale). We expect children who are randomized to HA-β-TCP graft to have less postoperative
      pain than children randomized to autologous bone graft.

      Design. Prospective, randomized controlled study.

      Randomization: Children who fulfill the criteria for inclusion together with their
      parents/guardian receive  information about the project. The patients are randomized to
      respectively HA-ß-TCP and iliac crest bone graft.

      Surgical procedure: Calcaneal lengthening osteotomy is performed between the anterior and
      middle facet of the subtalar joint. The corticalis of the calcaneus is bilaterally cut
      through. The planovalgus deformity is corrected and with a graft matching the wedged
      osteotomy is inserted. Tantalum balls are inserted into calcaneus on each side of the
      osteotomy and in cuboideum. Postoperative pain treatment consist of a tibial nerve catheter
      which is used the first 24 hours. Patients in whom graft is harvested from the iliac crest
      get local infiltration analgesics accordingly to a standardized procedure. The pain is
      registered by the use of a visual analog scale (VAS) a 3, 8 and 12 hours postoperative. The
      amounts of used analgesics are registered.

      Power and significance: The primary parameter is postoperative pain score. We expect the use
      of artificial bone graft will reduce the VAS score from 60 mm to 30 mm. A reduction of 30 mm
      corresponds to a significant fall in pain intensity. With reference to a former published
      study on a comparable patient group we expect a standard deviation of 25 mm in the
      population. Therefore the number of patients in each group should be 12  in order to
      demonstrate a significant difference of 30 mm. We strive towards 2x15 patients in order to
      compensate for eventual drop-outs. We used an non-paired design with power = 80 % of p &lt;
      0.05%.
