  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at Boston Children's Hospital are conducting research in order to better
      understand the genetic factors which may contribute to disorders related to epilepsy. These
      findings may help explain the broad spectrum of clinical characteristics and outcomes seen
      in people with epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children with epilepsy experience seizures which respond well to treatment. A few types
      of epilepsy, however, are characterized by seizures which begin very early in childhood and
      are associated with severe intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. These conditions,
      known as progressive epileptic encephalopathies, are particularly severe and are often
      difficult to treat. These syndromes include infantile spasms, early infantile epileptic
      encephalopathy with suppression bursts (Ohtahara syndrome), malignant migrating partial
      epilepsy of infancy, early myoclonic epileptic encephalopathy, and severe myoclonic epilepsy
      of infancy (Dravet syndrome).

      The investigators' current research effort is focused on children with epileptic
      encephalopathies, in particular Ohtahara syndrome.  The investigators' goal is to identify
      genetic alterations (known as &quot;mutations&quot;) that cause Ohtahara syndrome. By doing so the
      investigators hope to improve diagnosis and treatment for this condition. It is also
      possible that understanding the genetic basis of Ohtahara syndrome may in some instances
      make it possible to prevent it from occurring in the future.
