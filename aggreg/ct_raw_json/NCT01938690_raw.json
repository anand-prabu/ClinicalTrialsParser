            "textblock": "Approximately two thirds of stroke survivors have profoundly impaired function of the upper\n      limb. Currently the main stay of the treatment for upper limb motor function is\n      rehabilitation therapy focusing on repetitive and skillful task practice (task-oriented\n      therapy) which has been shown to induce substantial functional reorganization in the\n      undamaged motor cortex and functional recovery. In spite of rehabilitation therapy,\n      functional recovery of arm and hand function is limited to one third of stroke survivors and\n      there is a great need for adjunct treatment to current practice. Repetitive Transcranial\n      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive means of stimulating nerve cells in superficial\n      areas of the brain and emerging as a novel method of modulating cortical excitability and\n      promoting functional recovery after stroke. There have been studies using rTMS to improve\n      motor function after stroke. However, whether 1Hz rTMS can enhance the effect of the\n      task-oriented therapy on upper limb function after stroke has not been investigated. In this\n      pilot proposal, we intend to investigate the feasibility of 1Hz rTMS on unaffected\n      hemisphere as an adjunct to task-oriented therapy to improve upper limb motor function among\n      stroke patients. The information obtained from this pilot study will provide a platform for\n      the future randomized control trials combining the rTMS and task-oriented therapy to enhance\n      motor recovery among stroke survivors."
