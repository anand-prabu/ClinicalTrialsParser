      The purpose of this exploratory trial is to investigate whether PLIUS is potentially
      effective as a disease and symptom modifying intervention in patients with early knee OA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a prevalent and debilitating
      disease without therapies that alter disease progress and is currently managed with
      symptom-modifying therapies that are only modestly effective. In spite of substantial
      progress in understanding the pathogenesis of OA, no effective disease modifying
      interventions have been established. Degenerative joint cartilage is a central feature of
      OA, yet joint cartilage has a limited capacity for repair. Results from animal research
      demonstrate that pulsed low intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) mechanically stimulates, and may
      promote, cartilage repair. This exploratory trial will investigate whether PLIUS is
      potentially effective as a disease and symptom modifying intervention in patients with early
      knee OA.

          -  Pain in the index knee on motion or weight bearing for the majority of days during
             the month before screening

          -  Clinical diagnosis of primary osteoarthritis of the knee based on clinical and

             acceptable contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent medical/arthritis condition(s), or any other illness per the opinion of
             the investigator, that could interfere with the evaluation of pain or efficacy

          -  Spine or hip pain of significant magnitude

          -  History of significant ligament or meniscal injury of the index joint

          -  Corticosteroid use within 1 to 3 months prior to study entry

          -  Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid or congeners to the index knee within 3
             months of study entry

          -  Sustained use of oral NSAIDs or aspirin at anti-inflammatory doses (Aspirin use up to
             325 mg/day for cardiovascular reasons may be taken)

          -  Use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic medications and chronic tetracycline or its
             derivatives

          -  Exposure to glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, or any other treatment for
             osteoarthritis, within one month of study entry

          -  Use of topical NSAIDs or analgesics to the index knee or any oral analgesics, with
             the exception of acetaminophen and tramadol, within 2 weeks prior to or during the
             study

          -  Initiation of any other medical or physical therapy, or muscle conditioning program,
             within 1 month prior to or during the study

          -  Other medications unrelated to osteoarthritis unstable for 1 month prior to and
