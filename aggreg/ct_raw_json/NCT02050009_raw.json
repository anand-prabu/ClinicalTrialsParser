Determine the in situ effects of metformin on lethal-7 (let-7) expression as determined\n      by in situ hybridization. (Phase Ia) II. To determine the feasibility of using a core biopsy\n      to perform ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing. (Phase Ia) III. To determine epigenomic\n      effects of metformin via RNA-sequencing (Seq). (Phase Ia) IV. To determine the biologic\n      effects of metformin through evaluation of pre and post metformin tumor samples for\n      phosphorylated (p) adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), v-myc\n      myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (myc), mechanistic target of rapamycin\n      (mTOR) and phosphorylated v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog 1 (pAKT).
