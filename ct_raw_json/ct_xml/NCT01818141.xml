      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Compare quantitatively the number of vegetative cells in stool over time for
           fidaxomicin or vancomycin in patients diagnosed with their first episode of C.
           difficile infection

        -  Compare quantitatively the number of spores in the stool over time for patients
           presenting with their first episode of C. difficile infection having been treated with
           either fidaxomicin or vancomycin.
