The patients with peripheral arterial disease\n      who underwent abdominal aortograms with runoff (which are arteriograms of the lower\n      abdominal aorta and arteries in the legs) and Intravascular Ultrasound after stent\n      deployment will be enrolled in the study. All patients who participated in the study will be\n      treated according to standard of care.\n\n      HYPOTHESIS The higher degree of plaque burden on landing zone has an effect on restenosis on\n      peripheral artery intervention.\n\n      SPECIFIC AIMS\n\n        1. To determine intravascular ultrasound parameters of stent deployment and outcomes of\n           Femoro-popliteal Disease\n\n        2. To determine clinical risk factors and outcomes of Femoro-popliteal Disease\n\n        3. To obtain data that will eventually support development of a predictive model for ISR\n           in Femoro-popliteal Disease\n\n      METHODOLOGY Visit 1:  After consent is given\n\n      The subject will receive standard follow-up care. A member of the research team will collect\n      information such as the subject's age, sex, ethnicity, and medical information from the\n      subject's medical record.\n\n      Visits 2-5: 1 day after enrollment, and at months 3 (+- 2 weeks), 6 (+- 2 weeks), and 12 (+-\n      2 weeks)\n\n      The subject will complete standard follow-up appointment at TTUHSC.  This may include a\n      Doppler ultrasound.\n\n      A member of the research team will record information such as medications, ultrasounds, and\n      need for additional care related to the subject's stent.\n\n      The subject will complete the questionnaire on leg pain and mobility."
