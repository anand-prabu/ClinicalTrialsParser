We aim to\n      investigate, if the adjunct of an additional CHG-impregnated device on a routinely basis for\n      the daily care is as a valuable and effective option to reduce contamination of the EVD\n      entry-site and consecutive colonization of the catheter."

Secondary objectives are the\n      comparison of regrowth (CFU/cm2) every 5th day before routine change of the device,\n      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures every 2nd day and sonication of the catheter tip after\n      explantation (secondary endpoints).\n\n      We hypothesize that bacterial contamination (CFU/cm2) of the EVD entry-site after 5 days\n      compared to baseline (bacterial regrowth since baseline) in subjects treated with the 3M\u2122\n      Tegaderm\u2122 CHG I.V. Securement Dressing is significantly lower compared to subjects treated\n      with 3M\u2122 Tegaderm\u2122 I.V. Advanced Dressing. Quantitative microbiology of the catheter tip\n      (sonication) might be reduced by this external intervention, as well as CSF cultures.\n\n      We will use an internal pilot study design [3].
