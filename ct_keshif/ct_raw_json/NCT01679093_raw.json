During 2 hours in the postoperative unit, we raised : the\n      electrical pain's threshold with the PainMatcher, the numeric pain intensity scale and the\n      presence of nausea or vomiting. For each patients we determined the cytochrome P450 2D6\n      activity that should have been able to explain a diminution of ondansetron's efficiency.\n      Paracetamol blood levels were also raised in the postoperative unit."
