Patients\n      with normal CT results undergo additional CT scans every 12 months.\n\n      Patients with abnormal CT results undergo a diagnostic CT scan (in the absence of prior\n      studies). Patients with indeterminate nodules (less than 5 mm in size) undergo surveillance\n      CT studies within 3-4 months. If nodules remain unchanged in size, patients undergo\n      additional surveillance CT studies at 6 months and 1 year. Patients with lung parenchymal\n      abnormalities on CT suspicious for malignancy undergo a bronchoscopy with biopsy and\n      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Patients with abnormal CT scan(s) and negative BAL for p53\n      and/or K-ras mutations or normal histology and positive BAL for K-ras and/or p53 mutations\n      undergo additional CT scans at 6 months and 1 year. Patients with biopsy-proven malignancy\n      after bronchoscopy are referred for definitive treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study."
