These have\n      several advantages: a smaller and more cosmetic incision, reduced blood loss and shorter\n      postoperative stay, which cuts down on hospital costs. However, postoperative pain continues\n      to be one complication, which results in an unpleasant experience for the patient and at\n      times causes a delayed discharge. There are few studies about pain characteristics as one of\n      laparoscopic hysterectomy complications. The purpose of this study is to investigate the\n      prevalence and characteristics of shoulder pain, headache, abdominal pain, and back pain in\n      patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy."
