This is the belief that one can perform a novel or difficult tasks, or cope with adversity -- in various domains of human functioning.  Perceived self-efficacy facilitates goal-setting, effort investment,  persistence in face of barriers and recovery from setbacks. It can be regarded as a positive resistance resource factor. Ten items are designed to tap this construct. Each item refers to successful coping and implies an internal-stable attribution of success. Perceived self-efficacy is an operative construct, i.e., it is related to subsequent behavior and, therefore, is relevant for clinical practice and behavior change.\"",
