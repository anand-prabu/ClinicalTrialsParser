Participants with postitive screening\n      results are stratified according to age (under 50 vs 50-59 vs 60-70 vs over 70).\n      Participants are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Participants undergo a two-view screen-film mammogram followed by a two-view\n           digital mammogram of each breast.\n\n        -  Arm II: Participants undergo a two-view digital mammogram followed by a two-view\n           screen-film mammogram of each breast.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before the screening mammogram in the first 800 women enrolled.\n      In an additional 1,200 participants (600 with positive screening results and 600 with\n      negative screening results), quality of life is assessed shortly after the screening\n      mammogram and at 1 year.\n\n      Participants are followed at 1 year with a repeat screen-film or digital mammogram.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 49,500 participants (24,750 per arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 18 months."
