  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placebo needle is a useful tool to assess the efficacy of acupuncture. Investigators have
      applied a new kind of placebo needle in large scale acupuncture clinical trials, which named
      as pragmatic placebo needle. Compared with other placebo needles used in acupuncture trials,
      this pragmatic placebo needle shows several advantages: the outlook closer to traditional
      acupuncture needles, no restriction to needle depth of true needle, simple to manipulate and
      more economical. However, its blinding effect is not yet validated. The primary objective of
      this trial is to validate the blinding effect of the new pragmatic placebo needle; the
      secondary objective is to explore factors influencing the blinding effect of the placebo
      needles.

    <time_frame>12 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This questionnaire is used to collect the types and degree of needle sensation experienced by participants. Information is collected after the first and third acupuncture sessions. The difference between two kinds of needles is to be analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Degree of acupuncture pain</measure>
    <time_frame>12 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The pain of acupuncture is assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS). The mean VAS value of each period is used to compare the difference of acupuncture pain between two kinds of needles.</description>

    <time_frame>12 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>After the third acupuncture of each period, participants are asked to show their acceptance toward the needles with a 5-point scale: very difficult to accept, a little difficult to accept, moderately accept, easy to accept, very easy to accept.</description>

    <description>The success of blinding is defined as the participant's perception of needle penetration. The factors influencing subject blinding are to be analyzed, which mainly refer to factors of demography, acupuncture experience, acupuncture knowledge, location of acupoints, needle sensation, acupuncture pain, etc.</description>

    <description>Participants will accept acupuncture with real needle in the first period and pragmatic placebo needle in the second period. Acupoints are to be needled 1 cun by real needle in the first period, and pressed against the skin with no penetration by placebo needle in the second period. For each intervention, LI4 and RN12 are needled first in a supine position for 15 minutes; BL36 and BL25 are needled secondly in a prone position for another 15 minutes. After withdrawal of the needle, participants will be asked questions on skin penetration of needles, needling pain and needle sensation. The acupuncture treatment is given every other day. There are three sessions for each kind of needle, six sessions in total for each participant. There is a two-day interval between two kinds of interventions.</description>
