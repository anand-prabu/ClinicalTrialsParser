    <textblock>
      This study is a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of
      MG01CI (low dose and high dose once daily) for 6 weeks compared with placebo in a 1:1 ratio
      of 60 adolescent and adult subjects with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Following Screening,
      subjects will be randomized to MG01CI or matching placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and the 6 week
      Double-blind Treatment Period will begin on Day 1.

      The first 4 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-optimization period,

      All subjects will start with a single daily tablet of either low dose of metadoxine or
      matching blinded placebo. At weekly visits/phone assessments, the investigator will evaluate
      the dose based upon the investigator's assessment of safety and tolerability. If the subject
      demonstrates safety or tolerability concerns with the low dose after 1 or 2 weeks of
      treatment, then the subject will be discontinued. If there are no concerns about safety and
      tolerability after 2 weeks of treatment, then the dose will be increased to high dose or
      placebo. If at the high dose there are concerns about safety and tolerability, then the dose
      will be either kept the same or reduced to low dose for the remainder of the treatment
      period.

      There will be a 2-week Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early
      termination.

      This study is a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of
      MG01CI (low and high doses of metadoxine once daily) for 6 weeks compared with placebo in a
      1:1 ratio of 60 adolescent and adult subjects with FXS. Following Screening, subjects will
      be randomized to MG01CI or matching placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and the 6 week Double-blind
      Treatment Period will begin on Day 1.

      The first 4 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-optimization period, during which
      the subject's dose of MG01CI or placebo will be optimized. Investigators and subjects will
      be blinded with regard to whether the subject is taking active drug or placebo; however,
      subjects taking low dose active or placebo will take only 1 tablet per day, while those
      taking high dose active or placebo will take 2 tablets per day. A phone follow-up assessment
      of safety, tolerability, and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) will occur
      during titration after 1 and 3 weeks of treatment; if the investigator has any significant
      concerns regarding safety and tolerability, the subject will be assessed at the site at an
      unscheduled visit. All subjects will be assessed at the site after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of
      treatment.

      All subjects will start with a single daily tablet of either low dose or matching blinded
      placebo. At weekly visits/phone assessments, the investigator will evaluate the dose based
      upon the investigator's assessment of safety and tolerability. If the subject demonstrates
      safety or tolerability concerns with the low dose after 1 or 2 weeks of treatment, then the
      subject will be discontinued. If there are no concerns about safety and tolerability after 2
      weeks of treatment, then the dose will be increased to 2 tablets of either high dose of
      active treatment or placebo. If at high dose there are concerns about safety and
      tolerability, then the dose will be either kept the same or reduced tolow dose for the
      remainder of the treatment period.

      The last 2 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-maintenance period. During the
      dose-maintenance period, the subject will maintain his or her optimal dose as determined at
      the end of the dose-optimization period. A phone follow-up assessment of safety,
      tolerability, and CGI-I will occur after 5 weeks of treatment (after 1 week of dose
      maintenance). If the investigator has any significant concerns regarding safety and
      tolerability, the subject will be assessed at the site at an unscheduled visit. The subject
      will be assessed at the site after 6 weeks of treatment (after 2 weeks of dose maintenance).

      There will be a 2-week Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early
      termination.

                  medications and stimulants; see 4b and 4d) must be at a stable dose and dosing
                  regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during
                  the period between Screening and the commencement of study medication.

               2. Anti-epileptic medications must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for 12
                  weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between

               4. Stimulant medications must be at a stable dose and dosing regimen for 12 weeks
                  prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between Screening
                  and the end of the treatment period (Week 6/early termination).

          5. Behavioral treatments (excluding psychotherapy; see exclusion criteria) must be
             stable for 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period
             between Screening and the commencement of study medication.

          6. Subject has a parent, legal authorized guardian or consistent caregiver who interacts
             with the subject for at least 10 hours per week and is able to provide weekly rating

             negative urine pregnancy test at the Baseline Visit. Females of childbearing
             potential are defined as women who are between menarche and 2 years post-menopause
             and who are not surgically sterilized. Female subjects who are not sexually active,
             and who agree to be abstinent throughout the study, will not be required to use birth

             using medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, laboratory
             tests, and electrocardiograms. Common diseases such as mild hypertension,
             well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C [Hgb A1C] &lt;6.5%), etc. are
             allowed per the investigator's judgment as long as they are stable and controlled by
             medical therapy that is constant for at least 8 weeks before randomization and
             subsequently throughout the study. If there are any concerns about the suitability of
             the subject's medical or surgical condition, the investigator should review the
             subject's history with the medical monitor. Subjects with autism spectrum disorder or
             anxiety disorder will be allowed.

             allowed) or folic acid supplements (other than routine multivitamin supplements) at
             any time during the 2 weeks before the Screening Visit.

         16. Subject is related to the sponsor, investigator, or study staff.

         17. Subject has any condition that, in the principal investigator's opinion, would place
             the subject at risk or influence the conduct of the study or interpretation of
             results.
