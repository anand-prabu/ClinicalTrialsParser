  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to generate an exploratory training set of data and to identify
      predictive biomarkers (a measurable biological response that predicts something) of innate
      and adaptive responses to immunisation of two vaccines utilizing different adjuvant
      technology given according to approved schedules to healthy adult volunteers. The vaccines
      are model agents selected as they match antigens but have discordant adjuvants, have a known
      immunogenicity profile, assays are freely available to measure responses, and they are safe
      to administer to healthy adults at the doses and schedules proposed. This study will strive
      to correlate biomarker activity with observed immunological responses to vaccination and if
      successful, these biomarkers could be used in early stage clinical trials to optimize
      selection of vaccine candidates with a profile that will be most likely to be effective once
      they are in generalized use.

      The purpose of this study is to generate an exploratory training set of data and to identify
      predictive biomarkers (a measurable biological response that predicts something) of innate
      and adaptive responses to immunisation of two vaccines utilizing different adjuvant
      technology given according to approved schedules to healthy adult volunteers. The vaccines
      are model agents selected as they match antigens but have discordant adjuvants, have a known

      successful, these biomarkers could be used in early stage clinical trials to optimize
      selection of vaccine candidates with a profile that will be most likely to be effective once
      they are in generalized use.

      In this study, 15 subjects per vaccine will be recruited to receive immunization with one of
      two hepatitis B vaccines, Engerix B or Fendrix, representing exactly matched antigens
      (hepatitis B surface antigen) but discordant adjuvant technologies. Following a screening
      visit, subjects will be randomly allocated to receive three doses of a vaccine at 0, 1 and 2
      months. Innate immune responses (cytokine levels and whole blood gene expression) after
      doses #1 and #3 and adaptive immune responses (serum antibody and antigen specific cellular
      responses) will be measured at various timepoints after immunisation on an outpatient basis.

      The study is funded by ADITEC, which is a collaborative research programme that aims to
      accelerate the development of novel and powerful immunisation technologies for the next
      generation of human vaccines.

             Hepatitis B infection.

          6. The subject is seronegative to Hepatitis B as confirmed at screening by assessments
             of sAb, sAg, and cAb.

          7. Seronegative for HIV 1 &amp; 2 antibodies and hepatitis C antibodies at screening.

          8. Available for follow-up for the duration of the study.

          9. Agree to abstain from donating blood during and for three months after the end of
             their participation in the study, or longer if necessary.

         10. Visa long enough allowing them to complete the study (if applicable).

         11. The subject has venous access sufficient to allow blood sampling as per the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccines (excipients: sodium chloride,
             disodium phosphate dehydrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate; adjuvants: aluminium
             phosphate, AS04C, aluminium hydroxide; Hepatitis B antigen produced in yeast cells)
             or subjects who have exhibited hypersensitivity to any other Hepatitis B vaccine, or
             a history of any allergy that in the opinion of the investigator would contraindicate
             subject participation.

          2. Presence of primary or acquired immunodeficiency states with a total lymphocyte count
             less than 1,200 per mm3 or presenting other evidence of lack of cellular immune
             competence e.g. leukaemias, lymphomas, blood dyscrasias, or patients receiving
             immunosuppressive therapy (including regular use of oral, inhaled, topical or
             parenteral corticosteroids).

          3. Use of any immune suppressing or immunomodulating drugs within 6 months of Visit 1
             (screening).

          4. Regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (by any route of administration
             including topical) within 6 months of Visit 1 (screening) considered by the study
             physician as likely to interfere with immune responses.

          5. Receipt of a vaccine within 30 days of visit 2. Other vaccines (e.g. for travel) may
             be administered between visit 13 and 14 only.

             non-investigational drug or device, or has participated in a clinical study within
             the 3 months preceding Visit 1.

          7. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, compromises the subject's ability
             to meet protocol requirements or to complete the study.

          8. Receipt of blood products or immunoglobin, or blood donation, within 3 months of
             screening.

          9. Unable to read and speak English to a fluency level adequate for the full
