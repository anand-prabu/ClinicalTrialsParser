Subjects will be switched from their current opioid pain medication to\n      buprenorphine/naloxone to assess whether buprenorphine is at least as effective, if not more\n      effective, as other opioid medications in controlling their pain while simultaneously\n      improving their psychological distress, functional status, and other aspects of patients'\n      lives. We will utilize a home induction procedure, and maintain subjects on this oral\n      medication for a duration of 6 months. During this period"
