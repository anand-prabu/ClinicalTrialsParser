Cyclooxygenase\n      (COX) catalytic activity will be determined by measuring the metabolite of PGE2,\n      11alpha-hydroxy-9,12-dioxo-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20 dioic acid (PGE-M) in urine pre-\n      and post-ASA 325 mg as a surrogate of systemic PGE2 biosynthesis.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine whether COX-2 protein has a slow turnover in adenocarcinoma of the lung. COX\n      turnover will be determined by measuring urinary PGE-M levels daily for 7 days after\n      discontinuing ASA 325 mg. COX-2 and Prostaglandin expression will also be measured in tumor\n      samples of patients taken at the time of surgery.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) for 7 days and urine is collected for 7\n      days post therapy."
