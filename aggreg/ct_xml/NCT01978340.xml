  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to collect heart rate,  respiration rate and motion data of patients
      admitted to sleep lab and to determine the  accuracy level of the EarlySense system vs. the
      monitors used in sleep lab (e.g., Polysomnography, respiratory belts, ECG, etc..) . Data
      regarding sleep condition, scoring and quality of sleep and in and out of bed status,
      patient turns will also be collected and compared to data collected by EarlySense
      contactless monitor. Different patient population will be monitored including obese,
      morbidly obese, patients with or without obstructive/central apnea, patients with or without
      arrhythmia as well as healthy population who arrive to sleep lab for general evaluation will
      be monitored

      EarlySense sensors will be placed under the mattress of subjects who have been included in
      the study. The sensors will not be in any contact with the patient. Two sensors will be
      utilized and placed under the subject's chest and pelvis area. Accuracy of the sensors will
      be compared to each other and to the reference device.
