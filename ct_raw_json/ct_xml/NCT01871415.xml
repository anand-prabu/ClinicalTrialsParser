  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of aleglitazar in combination with metformin in patients
      with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who are inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either aleglitazar 150 mcg orally daily or placebo
      for 26 weeks in combination with their pre-existing metformin regimen and dose.
