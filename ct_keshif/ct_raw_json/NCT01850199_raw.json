            "textblock": "Gestational diabetes, diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy, affects 8.8% of pregnancies in\n      Spain that means more than 40,000 women per year. This prevalence is based on the National\n      Diabetes Data Group criteria, previous to the 4th workshop on Gestational Diabetes (1998),\n      but, if the new diagnosis criteria proposed by the International Associations of Diabetes\n      and Pregnancy Study Groups, based on the most important study never made before on this\n      topic, prevalence would increase to the double. When a women is diagnosed, the risk of\n      complications for her and the child increases and, therefore, she has to start an specific\n      diet and frequent visits to the diabetes center in order to check that glucose values do not\n      exceed 95 mg/dl before or 140 mg/dl 1-hour after meals. In other case, she should start\n      insulin treatment. Our project is aimed to develop intelligent tools based on neuro-diffuse\n      techniques and integrated in a telemedicine system that allows control of gestational\n      diabetes automatically, guaranteeing glucose control objectives consecution and avoiding\n      face-to-face visits to the health care center. Furthermore, educational and motivation tools\n      for a healthy behaviour will be included. At the end of the study efficacy and security\n      about insulin management will be compare with the recommendations proposed by the diabetes\n      team and data about direct and indirect costs will be calculated. The investigators\n      anticipate that the smart telemedicine system can allow us to detect high blood glucose\n      values earlier than in-person scheduled visits."

Patients with suspected clinical diagnosis of type 1\n      or type 2 diabetes will be excluded.\n\n      In addition to the signed acceptance to participate in the study, requirements are:\n\n        -  Availability of a desktop computer or laptop with an internet connection and USB port.\n\n        -  Sufficient knowledge of Catalan and/or Spanish\n\n        -  A mobile phone Objective: To technically evaluate the SineDie telemedicine system and\n           also the users' degree of satisfaction.\n\n      Methodology of the study: Once signed consent for participation the patient will be\n      randomized either to continue regularly scheduled visits (33% chance) or to use the\n      Telemedicine system (66% chance). The randomization will be done using a system of\n      allocation based on random numbers.
