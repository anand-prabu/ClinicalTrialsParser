This is a\n      first-in-human study of ID-LV305.  The primary purpose of the study is to determine what\n      dose of ID-LV305 can be given safely to patients with advanced cancers that express NY-ESO-1\n      protein.  ID-LV305 will be administered by intradermal injection every three weeks times\n      three doses.  The study will have two phases.  In Part 1 Dose Escalation, three sequentially\n      enrolled cohorts of patients will be treated at one of three dose levels of ID-LV305 using a\n      standard escalation design.  Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established, Part 2\n      Patient Expansion will begin using the highest safe dose level and the same treatment\n      regimen.  Three cancer indications will be expanded to include at least six patients each to\n      further examine safety and immunogenicity of the study agent.  This program was reviewed by\n      the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and received a recommendation that the Phase 1\n      trial could proceed."
