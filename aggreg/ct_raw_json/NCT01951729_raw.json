Once enrolled, subjects\n      will come for 8 different visits, each separated by about 3 weeks.  On each visit, the\n      subject will be given an intravenous infusion of glucose such that blood glucose levels\n      slowly increase over a 4 hour period.  On separate occasions, the participant will also\n      receive an infusion GIP alone, xenin-25 alone, GIP plus xenin-25, or placebo.  Each of these\n      4 infusions will be conducted with and without an infusion of atropine (thus- the 8 visits).\n       Blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as a host of other hormones, will be measured\n      during each of the study visits.
