The underlying goal of this study is to assess MNI-672 SPECT imaging as a tool to\n      detect \u00df amyloid deposition in the brain of AD research participants and young healthy male\n      subjects.  All study procedures will be conducted at Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New\n      Haven, CT.  Approximately 3 patients with AD and 3 young male HVs will be recruited to\n      participate in this study.  HVs will be screened to ensure that there is no evidence of\n      cognitive decline or significant neurological deficit.\n\n      All eligible subjects will be required to visit the study center on at least 2 occasions:\n\n        1. for one or more screening visits which should include a history and physical\n           examination, laboratory and extensive neuro-psychological testing and MRI brain\n           scanning.  AD subjects will also undergo Amyvid PET imaging as part of the Screening\n           Visit.\n\n        2. on one day for baseline examinations and MNI-672 administration and subsequent SPECT\n           scanning- followed by safety measures"
