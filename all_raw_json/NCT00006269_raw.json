Compare the incidence of grade 2-4 diarrhea after completion of irinotecan in\n      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with octreotide vs placebo. II. Compare\n      the duration of diarrhea and need for irinotecan dose reduction/ delay and hospitalization\n      in patients treated with these 2 regimens. III. Collect data on tumor response and 1 year\n      survival in patients treated with these 2 regimens. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics and\n      interaction of irinotecan and octreotide in a subset of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are stratified according to prior pelvic irradiation (yes vs no), age (under 70 vs 70 and\n      over), and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 or 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive octreotide intramuscularly (IM) once. Beginning\n      10-14 days later, patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients also\n      receive octreotide IM on the same day as irinotecan. Arm II: Patients receive placebo IM\n      once. Beginning 10-14 days later, patients receive irinotecan as in arm I. Patients also\n      receive placebo IM on the same day as irinotecan. Therapy continues every 3 weeks for at\n      least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed every 3 months through year 1.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
