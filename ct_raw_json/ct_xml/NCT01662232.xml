  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Impaired
      endothelial function (assessed as flow-mediated dilation) represents an early marker for
      later cardiovascular events. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that
      consumption of tea is associated with lower progression of atherosclerosis and reduced
      cardiovascular mortality.

      Tea contains high amounts of polyphenols with important biological activities. The green tea
      catechin epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most potent physiologically active
      compound in vitro. However, little is known about its contribution to beneficial effects of
      tea in vivo.

      In this crossover study the impact of a single dose of EGCG applied in different forms
      (green tea beverage, green tea extract and EGCG) on flow-mediated dilation is investigated
      in healthy volunteers two hours after ingestion. The amount of EGCG (200 mg) corresponds to
      appr. 0.5 L of green tea. The results of the study will elucidate the contribution of EGCG
      in cardiovascular protective effects of green tea in vivo. The outcomes will provide
      insights about the role of EGCG in different application forms to improvements of
      endothelial function in humans.
