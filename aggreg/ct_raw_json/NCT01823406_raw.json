To test this hypothesis, we will use sensitive and specific mass spectrometer based\n      metabolomic analysis  to measure steady state metabolite levels in plasma and urine from\n      controls subjects and subjects with T1DM, without and with diabetic complications during\n      euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies."
