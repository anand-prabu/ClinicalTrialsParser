  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if stimulation electrodes placed on the skin of the neck can help
      improve arm and hand function in people with paralysis from cervical spinal cord injury. The
      investigators hypothesize that this stimulation can reveal spared function in the cord of
      individuals who are clinically paralyzed, but who have some remaining connections between
      the brain and spinal cord.

    <description>Subjects will be tested by several measures of sensory and motor function, as well as self-assessments regarding quality of life and independence, at the beginning of the study and at each testing session. These tests include:
American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring system. Box and block CUE (Capabilities of Upper Extremity) GRASSP (Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension) SCIM (Spinal Cord Independence Measure)

          -  Not dependent on ventilation support

          -  No painful musculoskeletal dysfunction, unhealed fracture, pressure sore, or urinary
             tract infection that might interfere with upper extremity rehabilitation or testing
             activities

          -  No clinically significant depression or  ongoing drug abuse

          -  Adequate social support network to be able to participate in weekly training and
             assessment sessions for the duration of the 18 week study period

          -  No current anti-spasticity regimen

          -  Must not have received botox injections in the prior six months
