  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lysosome is a specialized part of the cell that functions to degrade metabolic wastes in
      the cell.  Defects in the functioning of the lysosome result in accumulation and subsequent
      storage of such metabolic wastes.  These defects lead to conditions known as lysosomal
      storage diseases (LSD).  LSDs are caused by inherited genetic mutations and there are over
      40 genetically distinct lysosomal storage diseases.  Within each specific lysosomal storage
      disease there are variances in severity of disease, age of onset, and clinical presentation.
       Though the genetic mutations contributing to the disease have been largely clarified, the
      molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to variations in each distinct LSD remain
      unclear.  With this study we intend to better understand at the cellular and molecular level
      how the accumulation and storage of metabolic wastes in the lysosome affect the clinical
      manifestation of LSDs, to detect changes in these mechanisms upon treatment administration,
      and to correlate these results to genetic information.  The knowledge obtained from this
      research study could lead to better ways to diagnose and treat lysosomal storage diseases.

    <description>Genetic information (DNA) will be collected from biological samples (e.g. blood, skin cells) and correlated with clinical signs and symptoms. DNA will be sequenced in order to identify a specific mutation. Fluorescence assay will be performed to measure the enzyme activity of the affected protein. Physical examination will be performed, and supporting test results will be collected for identifying the signs and symptoms of the particular disorder.</description>
