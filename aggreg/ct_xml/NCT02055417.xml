  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 3-year study, the investigators will develop and pilot test an intervention called
      Personal Approaches to Treatment Choices for HIV (PATCH). PATCH is a brief intervention
      designed to support participants' decision-making processes and enhance intrinsic motivation
      to initiate ART, using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. The intervention will be
      targeted at HIV-positive African-American adults in inner-city Baltimore, Maryland who are
      suboptimally engaged in care and who endorse conspiracy beliefs about HIV or low readiness
      to begin ART. The specific aims are: (1) Develop and refine a manual for a brief MI
      intervention to support ART decision-making and reduce the likelihood of ART refusal: (2)
      Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the PATCH intervention in a small
      sample of individuals who are African-American, recommended for ART but who are not current
      taking it, and who experience multiple barriers to ART adherence; and (3) Conduct a small
      randomized controlled pilot to test the potential efficacy of the PATCH intervention in
      producing positive attitudinal changes, including a reduction in conspiracy beliefs and
      perceived barriers to ART and stated readiness to begin ART.
