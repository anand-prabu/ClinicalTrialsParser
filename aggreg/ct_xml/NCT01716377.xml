      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the potential efficacy of venlafaxine
      administration in reducing acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain in individuals presenting
      to the ED for evaluation after motor vehicle collision.

      Participants: Participants will consist of 60 patients between the ages of 18-50 who present
      to the ED within 12 hours post-motor vehicle collision.  Patients who report a neck pain
      score &gt; 6 will be screened for further eligibility.

      Procedures (methods): Using a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial design, 60
      high risk patients will be randomized to venlafaxine vs. placebo in the ED.  The ability of
      venlafaxine to decrease acute and persistent musculoskeletal neck pain will be assessed
      during serial short-term telephone follow-ups as well as more in-depth follow-ups at 6
      weeks, 4 months, and 6 months post-MVC.
