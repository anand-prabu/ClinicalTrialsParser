    <textblock>
      Four-drug combo yielded a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival
      and overall survival compared to gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. Nab-Paclitaxel showed promising antitumor activity in patients with
      pancreatic cancer. Given the synergism of taxanes with gemcitabine, fluoropyrimidines and
      platinating agents the role of nab-Paclitaxel in a 4-drug regimen will be explored.

      The aim of this trial is to determine the recommended dose of nab-paclitaxel in combination
      with cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine, PAXG regimen (Phase I), and to evaluate the
      feasibility and the activity of the PAXG regimen in patients with stage III and IV
      pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: PHASE I: to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of nab-paclitaxel in
      combination with cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine.

      PHASE II: to evaluate the feasibility and the activity of the PAXG regimen in terms of
      6-months progression-free survival in patients with stage III and IV pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE Phase I - dose finding single institution trial, followed by a randomized open label
      multicenter phase II trial.

      Phase II: Patients will be stratified by stage (III vs IV) and CA19.9 level (&lt; 10 x ULN
      versus &gt;10 x ULN); Patients will be randomly assigned to receive PAXG (arm A) or PEXG
      regimen (arm B).

      Treatment plan (phase II):

      Arm A: PAXG every 4 weeks (1 cycle): cisplatin at 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, nab-paclitaxel
      at the RP2D on days 1 and 15, capecitabine at 1250 mg/ m2 days 1-28, gemcitabine at 800 mg/
      m2 on days 1 and 15.

      Arm B: PEXG every 4 weeks (1 cycle): same as above for cisplatin, gemcitabine and
      capecitabine, plus epirubicin at 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15.

      Treatment will be administered for a maximum of 6 cycles or until there is a clinical
      benefit.
