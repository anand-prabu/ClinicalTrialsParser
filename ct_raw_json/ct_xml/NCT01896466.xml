  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is twofold:

        1. Establish baseline measures of gait performance in healthy young and older adults, and
           older adults with a history of falls.

        2. Investigate the effects of gait and balance training with and without cranial nerve
           noninvasive neuromodulation (CN-NINM) on postural balance and gait performance in older
           adults.

      For the second purpose, the study will incorporate a placebo-controlled design to evaluate
      the effects of CN-NINM augmented exercise compared to physical exercises alone. Both groups
      will perform gait and postural balance training (outlined in more detail below) but will
      differ in the stimulation level of the PoNS device. The investigators will use the results
      of this study as a first step toward evaluating the benefits of CN-NINM in a falls
      prevention program.
