Furthermore, by acquiring skin and tumor biopsies, we\n      will assess intratumoral concentrations of sunitinib, correlate these to skin and plasma\n      concentrations and gain more insight into the biological effects of the drug. Additionally,\n      we aim to preliminary assess the efficacy of sunitinib administered at the MTD level in both\n      schedules. Known serum angiogenesis markers will be correlated to efficacy endpoints."
