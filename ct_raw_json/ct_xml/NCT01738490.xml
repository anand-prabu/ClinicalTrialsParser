  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to investigate the Ponto wide implant considering; initial
      implant stability, stability over time, skin reaction and long term success when loaded at 3
      weeks post surgery. Patients' quality of life improvements following implantation will also
      be surveyed.

      More specifically the primary objective of this clinical study is to test the hypothesis

        -  The new Ponto wide diameter implant offers increased implant stability measured as ISQ
           (implant stability quotient) compared to the previous generation Ponto implant.

      And the secondary objective is to

        -  Investigate when in time implant stability is the lowest as the initial mechanical
           stability is gradually replaced by biological stability

    <description>ISQ (implant Stability Quotient) is a measurement scale for use with the Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) method of determining implant stability. The measurement is made using the Osstell Mentor equipment (Osstell, Sweden) with SmartPegs. ISQ values range from 1 to 100, the higher the score the higher the stability. The highest and lowest score obtained from perpendicular measurements will be registered.</description>

    <description>Implant stability can be seen as a combination of mechanical stability, which is the result of compressed bone holding the implant tightly in place, and biological stability, which is the result of new bone forming at the site of implantation and osseointegration. Mechanical stability is generally high immediately after implant placement and is decreasing with time. Biological stability, on the other hand, is non-existent immediately after placement and increases with time. The final stability level for an implant is the sum of the two. There is likely to be an initial decrease in stability followed by a subsequent increase as the implant becomes biologically stable. ISQ (implant Stability Quotient) is a measurement scale for use with the Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) method of determining implant stability.</description>

    <description>The APHAB is a 24-item self-assessment inventory in which patients report the amount of trouble they are having with communication or noises in various everyday situations. Benefit is calculated by comparing the patient's reported difficulty in the unaided condition with their amount of difficulty when using amplification. The APHAB produces scores for 4 subscales: Ease of Communication (EC), Reverberation (RV), Background Noise (BN), and Aversiveness (AV).</description>
