  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is  to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of
      GSK Biologicals' 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in children aged between 2 and 17 years of age having
      asplenia, splenic dysfunction or complement deficiencies.

      In addition, this study will include an age-matched control group of healthy children aged
      24-59 months in order to descriptively compare the immunogenicity of 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in
      the at-risk population to that of the general, healthy population one month after each
      pneumococcal vaccination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that parent(s)/Legally Acceptable
             Representative(s) [LAR(s)] can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject and
             informed assent obtained from the subject, if appropriate, prior to enrollment.

          -  Female subjects of non-child bearing potential may be enrolled in the study.
             (Non-child bearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy or ovariectomy).

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to the first vaccination,
                  and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Priming status:

          -  Children who have not been previously vaccinated with any pneumococcal vaccine, i.e.
             either plain polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix (10Pn-PD-DiT), Prevenar
             or Prevenar13 will be considered for inclusion in the unprimed groups.

        Children who have been previously vaccinated with:

          -  at least one dose of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, i.e. either Synflorix
             (10Pn-PD-DiT), Prevenar or Prevenar13

          -  with plain polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine more than 2 years and less than 5
             years before enrollment.

          -  will be considered for inclusion in the primed groups.

        Additional inclusion criteria for the At-risk groups:

          -  A male or female aged between, and including, 2 and 17 years at the time of first
             vaccination.

          -  For the purpose of this study, at-risk subject is a subject with:

               -  Congenital or acquired asplenia such as anatomic, surgical or functional
                  asplenia or

               -  Splenic dysfunction, chronic gastrointestinal disorders, liver disease,
                  infiltrative disorders, vascular disorder etc or

        Note: All individuals who are diagnosed by the investigator as with splenic dysfunction
        are eligible for enrollment in the At-risk group. When available, investigator will
        collect medical documentation for reduced splenic function diagnosed with an appropriate
        technique in the At-risk subject's medical records. No further assessment will be
        necessary. A maximum of 35 individuals with sickle-cell disease can be enrolled in the
        At-risk group. These subjects do not require assessment of the splenic function as
        sickle-cell disease is invariably associated with severe splenic dysfunction.

        -  Complement deficiencies. For all subjects defined as At-risk the Investigator will make
        all efforts to collect information from the subject/subject's parent(s)/LAR(s) during the
        interview and/or from previously available medical documentation on the date and
        conditions which have made a child at-risk of pneumococcal infection and/or the results of
        tests determining spleen dysfunction or complement deficiency. This should be documented
        in the medical records of the At-risk subject. No originals/copies of medical
        documentation are needed.

        Additional inclusion criteria for the Healthy group:

          -  A male or female matched (for age and country) to a subject aged 24-59 months from
             the At-risk group.

             entering into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care.

             study period.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             during the period starting 30 days before each dose of vaccine(s) and ending 30 days
             after*.

             * In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat is
             organised by the public health authorities, outside the routine immunization program,
             vaccines can be administered at any time during the study period provided it is
             licensed and used according to its Summary of Product Characteristics or Prescribing
             Information and according to the local governmental recommendations and that a
             written approval of the Sponsor is provided. Vaccines that are recommended for

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months

             vaccine within the last 8 weeks.

          -  Previous vaccination against pneumococcal infection with plain polysaccharide vaccine
             within the last 2 years.

        Additional exclusion criteria for the Healthy group:
