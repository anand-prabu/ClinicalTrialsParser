  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the treatment combination of alternating
      standard chemotherapy and another (melphalan) chemotherapy at different interval schedules.
      Researchers want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the treatment combination has on
      the patients and their retinoblastoma.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 4 months.

               1. Age greater than or equal to 4 months but less than 6 months of age can receive
                  up to 2 cycles of systemic chemotherapy to bridge until 6 months (cohort 2).

               2. Age greater than or equal to 6 months at study entry (cohort 1) to receive
                  alternating therapy.

          -  Intraocular retinoblastoma not previously treated with systemic chemotherapy,
             radiation therapy, or IA therapy. Local retinal therapy such as laser
             photocoagulation and cryotherapy will be permitted.

          -  Unilateral or bilateral RB patients are eligible

          -  Patients will be registered on study based on the local exam under anesthesia (EUA)
             done for diagnostic purposes prior to study entry. The EUA done at study entry should
             be done within 14 days prior to study entry

          -  Patients may have had enucleation of one eye, as long as the remaining eye meets the
             eligibility criteria

          -  Involved eye(s) must meet the definition for International Classification of
             Retinoblastoma Group D or E

               1. Group D eye can be unilateral or bilateral

               2. Group E eye will be eligible if bilateral involvement or unilateral involvement
                  in a child less than 1 year of age

               3. Patients with bilateral disease in which one of the eyes has Group C disease are
                  not eligible until interval level 2 in cohort 1 and are not eligible for cohort
                  2

          -  Adequate Renal Function defined as: creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR ³
             70mL/min/1.73 m2 OR a serum creatinine based on age and gender as follows:

        The threshold creatinine values in this Table were derived from the Schwartz formula for
        estimating GFR (Schwartz et al. J. Peds, 106:522, 1985) utilizing child length and stature
        data published by the CDC

          -  Adequate hematological function defined as:

               1. Absolute Neutrophil Count &gt; 750/microliter

               2. Platelet Count &gt; 100,000/microliter

          -  Adequate liver function defined as total bilirubin should be less than or equal to
             1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age and SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) &lt; 5 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN) for age

          -  Adequate coagulation system as defined as an international normalized ratio (INR) of
             less than 1.4 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of less than 34

          -  The effects of melphalan, carboplatin, etoposide and vincristine are harmful on the
             developing human fetus. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men
             must agree to use adequate contraception: hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence, prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately
