The first part (Phase 1) is called a\n      dose-escalation.  Not all subjects enrolled into this phase of the study will receive the\n      same dose.   The purpose of the dose-escalation is to determine the highest safe dose of\n      STI571 that can be used in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin.  That dose will be used\n      in Phase 2."
