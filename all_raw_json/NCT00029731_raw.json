ACS is a common cause of morbidity in SCD patients and is the most common\n      cause of death in SCD. Multiple factors are involved in the severity of acute pulmonary\n      injury in SCD. Nitric oxide has a multitude of related functions, many of which could impact\n      favorably on ACS in SCD. Nitric oxide is an important inflammatory mediator which is\n      produced by the conversion of L-arginine to citrulline by nitric oxide synthase. Nitric\n      oxide and its precursor, arginine, are known to be low in SCD patients with ACS, suggesting\n      that therapies, such as arginine, aimed at increasing nitric oxide production will improve\n      the clinical course of ACS. Patients will receive 1 of 3 doses of arginine hydrochloride\n      orally 3 times a day for 3 days while hospitalized. The efficacy of arginine will be\n      measured by the increase in nitric oxide production and the physiological effects will be\n      assessed."
