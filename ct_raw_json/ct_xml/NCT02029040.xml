  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial  in the Pediatric Emergency Department.
      The primary objective is to determine whether nebulized 3% hypertonic saline is more
      effective than nebulized 0.9% saline in the treatment of bronchiolitis in the emergency
      department.

    <description>The primary outcome variable is the Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) which is a sum of the change in the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI)score plus a standardized score for the change in respiratory rate; the change in respiratory rate is assigned 1 point per each 10% change in the respiratory rate</description>

    <description>Once consented, the study drug (in this arm: 3% Hypertonic Saline) will be ordered by a physician at the request of a study team member. Once the drug order set is received by a pharmacist, he/she will obtain the study drug from an Omnicell and prepare the medication to a volume of 3 mL in a syringe with a blinded study label prepared in advance by the IDS pharmacy.  The pharmacist will then give the study drug to the patient's respiratory therapist or the bedside nurse. The respiratory therapist or the nurse will pour the drug from a syringe to an inhaler cup and the study drug will be given by the standard nebulizer over the course of  15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Within 5-15 minutes following the administration of the study drug, the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) score will be reassessed and study interventions are complete. The patient will be observed for one hour in the emergency department (ED). However, further treatments may be started immediately upon discretion of the treating physician. If the patient is discharged home study PI and/or research assistant will call the parents 7 days from the ED visit to check the number of visits to their primary doctor and/or EDs due to same illness.</description>
