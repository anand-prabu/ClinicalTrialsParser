At selected centers, up to 3 additional groups of 3 patients each\n      will receive study drug up to 48 hours. Catheters are removed 1 day after completion of the\n      infusion. A gadolinium enhanced MRI is performed during week 8. Patients with partial\n      response, minimal response, or stable disease repeat the above treatments during week 9.\n      Patients with complete response, progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicity receive no\n      additional treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed every month until disease progression. All patients regardless of\n      disease progression or retreatment are followed at 36 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (20 patients with newly diagnosed unresectable\n      glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]; 20 patients with recurrent GBM; and 20 patients with\n      recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma) will be accrued for this study."
