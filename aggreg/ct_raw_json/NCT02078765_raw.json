Three factors seem to affect the night time BP:\n      chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the way ambulatory blood pressure\n      is monitored.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      Central 24-h blood pressure monitoring is a better way of monitoring blood pressure than\n      conventional peripheral monitoring.\n\n      In hypertension, chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) the night time\n      blood pressure is elevated, and is OSA the elevation is correlated to the severity of OSA.\n\n      In OSA the kidneys handling of salt and water is disturbed. In OSA there is disturbances in\n      hormonal balance."
