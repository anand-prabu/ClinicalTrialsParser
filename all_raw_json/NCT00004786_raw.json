Thrombolytic drugs, oral\n      anticoagulants, and heparin are prohibited on study. Concurrent therapy with\n      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for Raynaud's is prohibited; calcium channel\n      blockers for severe digital ischemia are allowed as needed.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks."
