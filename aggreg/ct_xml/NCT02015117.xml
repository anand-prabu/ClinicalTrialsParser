      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib with or without
      whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases. Trametinib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as trametinib,
      may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving trametinib with whole brain
      radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for brain metastases.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the maximally tolerated dose of trametinib to be used in combination with
      whole brain radiation therapy in patients with brain metastases from primary cancers
      harboring v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma
      viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS),
      or HRAS mutations to be used in a phase II trial. (Cohort A) II. To quantify trametinib in
      resected brain metastatic lesions utilizing high performance liquid chromatography/tandem
      mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and compare to quantification of adjacent tissues: brain
      margin, arachnoid, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (Cohort B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability and feasibility of the combination of trametinib and
      radiation therapy to brain for brain metastases.

      II. To evaluate the objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria of combination trametinib and radiation therapy.

      III. To evaluate the local control rate, as measure from the time of stud enrollment until
      the time of death.

      IV. To evaluate the neurologic progression-free survival, as measured from the time of study
      enrollment until the time of progression within the brain or death.

      V. To evaluate overall survival, as measured from the time of study enrollment until the
      time of death.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify cyclin D1, p27, phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (pERK)-1/2,
      phosphorylated v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog 1 (pAKT), phosphatase and tensin
      homolog gene (PTEN), phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (pMTOR), phosphorylated
      ribosomal protein S6 kinase (pS6K), and pS6 of resected metastatic brain lesions via
      quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) and compare to the IHC profile of the primary tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trametinib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment cohorts.

      COHORT A: Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 weeks. Beginning in
      week 2, patients undergo whole brain radiation therapy five days a week for 3 weeks.
      Treatment continues for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      COHORT B: Patients receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-14 followed by surgical resection of
      the tumor.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks, every 2 months
      for 1 year, and then every 3 months for 2 years.

               -  Other anti-cancer therapy while on study treatment; (note: megestrol [Megace] if
                  used as an appetite stimulant is allowed)

               -  Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates is permitted; however, treatment must
                  be initiated prior to the first dose of study therapy; prophylactic use of

                  the treatment of osteoporosis

               -  Concurrent use of all herbal supplements is prohibited during the study
                  (including, but not limited to, St. John's wort, kava, ephedra [ma huang],
                  gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], yohimbe, saw palmetto, or ginseng)

          -  In vitro studies suggest that the metabolism of trametinib is mediated predominantly
             by non-cytochrome (CYP)-mediated processes and possibly by cytochrome P450, family 3,
             subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4); therefore, drugs that potently inhibit or induce
             CYP3A4 should be administered with caution, as they may alter exposure to trametinib;
             below are a few examples of the agents:

               -  Drugs that may increase exposure of trametinib (CYP3A4 inhibitors):

                    -  Antivirals: Amprenavir, atazanavir, fosamprevanir, indinavir, lopinavir,
                       nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir

                    -  Antibiotics: Clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin

                    -  Antifungals: Fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole

                    -  Antidepressants: Nefazodone

                    -  Calcium channel blockers: Mibefradil, diltiazem, verapamil

                    -  Miscellaneous: Aprepitant

               -  Drugs that may decrease exposure of trametinib (CYP3A4 inducers)

                    -  Antivirals: Efavirenz, nevirapine

                    -  Antibiotic: Rifampin

                    -  Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin

               -  Trametinib may be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C,
                  polypeptide 8 (CYP2C8) in vivo; caution should be exercised when dosing
                  trametinib concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that
                  are substrates of CYP2C8; below are a few examples of the agents

                    -  Drug metabolism potentially affected by trametinib resulting in increased
                       exposure of these substrates

                         -  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG CoA)-reductase inhibitors:
                            Cerivastatin

                         -  Thiazolidinediones: Rosiglitazone, pioglitazone

                         -  Miscellaneous: Chloroquine, zopiclone, repaglinide

               -  As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be
                  counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new
                  medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new
                  over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

                  glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled systemic disease such as
                  hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or history of hyperviscosity or
                  hypercoagulability syndromes)

               -  Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic exam that is considered a
                  risk factor for RVO or CSR such as evidence of new optic disc cupping, evidence

               -  History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction and

             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible; appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding (women of childbearing potential should be advised to
             avoid pregnancy and use effective methods of contraception; men with a female partner
