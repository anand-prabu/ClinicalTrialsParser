            "textblock": "Patients with renal failure receiving hemodialysis experience an increased rate of skeletal\n      muscle protein catabolism which is associated with a number of co-morbid conditions\n      including declines in muscle mass and strength, significantly increased fall risk, and\n      reduced quality of life (QOL.  Therefore, interventions to prevent muscle loss in\n      hemodialysis are needed.  Pharmacological agents have been investigated to treat muscle loss\n      in dialysis patients; however, many of these treatments are expensive and have undesirable\n      side effects.  As a result, low-cost interventions designed to attenuate losses in muscle\n      mass and strength in hemodialysis patients are needed.\n\n      Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) represents a potential low-cost nutritional\n      intervention to attenuate muscle loss in hemodialysis patients.  HMB is a metabolite of the\n      amino acid leucine that has been shown to safely increase muscle mass in other clinical\n      populations with prevalent muscle loss, such as the elderly, cancer, and AIDS  patients\n      primarily through reductions in skeletal muscle protein catabolism.  The primary purpose of\n      the trial is to determine if oral supplementation with HMB attenuates muscle loss, improves\n      muscle strength, physical function, fall risk and QOL in hemodialysis patients.  Alterations\n      in protein and gene expression associated with skeletal muscle protein turnover will be\n      measured to investigate the mechanism for changes in our primary outcomes.  We hypothesize\n      that HMB supplementation will attenuate declines in muscle size and strength in hemodialysis\n      patients."
