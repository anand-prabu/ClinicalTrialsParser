      Open-label, dose- escalation study in subjects with previously treated B-cell malignancies
      to find maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or pharmacologic active dose of a PI3Kδ inhibitor,
      INCB050465.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label dose escalation study in subjects with previously treated B-cell
      malignancies that will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INCB050465 or
      alternatively, a tolerated dose that produces substantial pharmacologic target inhibition at
      trough; this dose will be chosen for further evaluation and potential use in a Phase 2
      clinical study as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).  An expansion cohort will evaluate
      the RP2D in up to 15 subjects to further determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK
      and PD in this population.

      The dose escalation will be conducted with an accelerated titration design based on
      observing each dose level for a period of 21 days before enrolling the next cohort and
      administering the next dose level.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years or older, with lymphoid malignancies of B-cell origin including:

               1. Indolent / aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)

               2. Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) EXCLUDING:  Burkitt's lymphoma and precursor B
                  lymphoblastic    leukemia/lymphoma

          -  Life expectancy of 12 weeks or longer.

          -  Subject must have received ≥ 1 prior treatment regimens.

          -  The subject must not be a candidate for potentially curative therapy including
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received an investigational study drug(s) within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever
             is longer) prior to receiving the first dose of study drug or with medical monitor
             approval.

          -  Received any approved anticancer medications within 21 days or 5 half-lives
             (whichever is longer) prior to receiving the first dose of study drug (42 days for
             nitrosoureas) EXCEPT steroids at ≤ 10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) or with
             medical monitor approval.

          -  Has any unresolved toxicity ≥ Grade 2 from previous anticancer therapy except for
             stable chronic toxicities (≤ Grade 2) not expected to resolve, such as stable Grade 2
             peripheral neurotoxicity.

          -  Has history of brain metastasis, spinal cord compression, or lymphoma involving the
             CNS.

          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≥ 3.
