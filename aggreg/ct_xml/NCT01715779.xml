  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational study is to characterize long-term (5 years post event)
      clinical outcomes in patients who experienced a thromboembolic event (TEE) during
      participation in the GSK ENABLE clinical trials.

      Patients eligible for the study are patient who experienced a TEE during participation in
      the ENABLE trials. Each included patient will be followed for a period of 5 years from the
      date of their first TEE. Demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected for the
      index date (time of TEE) and every sixth month during the follow-up period, information will
      be collected for the outcomes of interests: mortality, new TEE, hepatic decompensation,
      evaluation for liver transplant and result of evaluation, and liver transplantation.

      All information will collected by medical record review.
