Up to one-third of\n      previously non-diabetic patients develop NODAT after a kidney transplant.  Corticosteroids\n      and calcineurin inhibitors are two commonly utilized anti-rejection medications that\n      contribute to diabetes development through multiple mechanisms; including decreased insulin\n      production by the pancreas.  Sitagliptin is an oral medication that results in increased\n      insulin secretion.  We hypothesize that administration of sitagliptin to transplant\n      recipients identified to be at risk for diabetes development will reduce the incidence and\n      severity of NODAT."

In this trial, previously non-diabetic adult patients\n      with hyperglycemia (random BS >200mg/dL) in the first 72 hours following kidney transplant\n      will be screened to determine eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Patients\n      that meet study entry criteria will be stratified based on HbA1c (<5.7 or 5.7-6.4%) and\n      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups:  sitagliptin versus placebo.\n      Fifty patients (25 per group) will be enrolled.  Dosing period will be 3 months at which\n      time study drug will be discontinued and patients will be followed for an additional 3 month\n      period.\n\n      Study visits will occur at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months.  A HbA1c and 2-hour OGTT will be obtained\n      prior to randomization and at the 3 and 6 month study visit.\n\n      Screening period (Visit 1)\n\n      All patients presenting for living-donor or deceased donor kidney transplant will have a\n      medical history, medication history, vital signs, height, weight, body mass index, physical\n      exam, random blood sugar, HbA1c and EKG done as part of routine pre-transplant protocol at\n      Barnes Jewish Hospital.  Patients with hyperglycemia, defined as a random blood sugar \u2265 200\n      mg/dL, in the first 72 hours after kidney transplant will be screened to determine\n      eligibility for the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\n      Randomization (Visit 2)\n\n      Patients meeting study entry criteria and consenting to study participation will be\n      stratified based on HbA1c (<5.7 or 5.7-6.4%) and block randomized in blocks of eight in a\n      1:1 ratio to sitagliptin versus placebo.  Sitagliptin dose will be 100mg/day, adjusted per\n      creatinine clearance and tolerability.  A 2-hour OGTT will be performed within 24 hours\n      prior to initiation of sitagliptin.  Patients will be instructed by a licensed diabetic\n      educator on proper measurement and recording of fasting and post-prandial blood sugars.\n      Subjects will be provided a log, standard glucometer and testing strips to maintain a blood\n      sugar log post-discharge.  Visit 2 will occur within 24 hours after Visit 1.\n\n      Drug dosing period (Visits 3-4)\n\n      Sitagliptin or placebo will be continued until 3 months post-transplant, at which time study\n      medication will be discontinued and collected from the subject.  At the 1 and 3 month\n      visits, vital signs, height, weight, and BMI will be obtained.  A physical exam will be\n      performed.  Blood sugar logs provided by the patient will be reviewed and adverse effects\n      recorded.  At the 3 month visit (Visit 4), a HbA1c, 2-hour OGTT, fasting C-peptide and\n      insulin level will be obtained.\n\n      Follow-up (Visit 5)\n\n      At the 6 month final visit, 3 months following discontinuation of study medication, vital\n      signs, height, weight, BMI, HbA1c, 2-hour OGTT, fasting C-peptide and insulin level will be\n      obtained.  A physical exam will be performed.  Blood sugar logs provided by the patient will\n      be reviewed and adverse effects recorded."
