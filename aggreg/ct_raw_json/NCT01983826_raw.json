The investigators will specifically address whether dietary nitrate\n      supplementation enhances blood vessel function, blood pressure regulation, and exercise\n      capacity.  The proposed project uses an array of clearly defined measurements which will\n      allow investigators to quantify blood vessel function (vasodilator responsiveness and\n      arterial stiffness), blood pressure (variability and responsiveness to stress), and\n      functional capacity before and after 8 weeks of dietary supplementation."
