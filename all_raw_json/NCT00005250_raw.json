The syndrome segregated as a Mendelian recessive in the highly\n      inbred population under study and resulted in the sudden death of several members of the\n      population.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The entire population was screened to identify cases of LQTS.  In addition, 29 obligate\n      heterozygotes were studied by 24-hour Holter monitoring to determine whether these gene\n      carriers had any subtle phenotypes.  The data were subjected to complex segregation and\n      linkage analysis to establish the mode of inheritance and penetrance of LQTS."
