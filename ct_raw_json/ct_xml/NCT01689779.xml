  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While vitamin D insufficiency [25(OH)D &lt;30 ng/mL] is common in the general population,
      hypovitaminosis D may affect 40-80% of patients in the perioperative setting. Recent
      evidence also suggests that surgical stress may be associated with a 40% reduction in
      circulating 25(OH)D levels when compared to preoperative values. Moreover, the derangement
      in perioperative 25(OH)D levels may be sustained for up to 3 months after surgery. This
      finding has potential implications regarding modifiable risk factors for surgical site
      infections (SSIs), which account for nearly 40% of all nosocomial infections. On aggregate,
      SSIs result in 3.7 million extra hospital days per annum and an added burden of $1.6 billion
      in annual healthcare costs. A growing body of evidence suggests that robust postoperative
      immune function is associated with a lower risk of SSIs. At the same time, vitamin D is
      increasingly recognized as a key regulator of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Yet,
      optimization of perioperative vitamin D status remains grossly understudied. Although our
      overarching aim is to study the impact of vitamin D status on SSIs, the focus of the current
      investigation is to determine whether the administration of a &quot;bolus&quot; oral dose of
      cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in the preoperative setting alters vitamin D status in the
      perioperative setting (compared to a placebo). The investigators elected to conduct the
      current study in patients who will undergo colorectal surgery since these patients are
      historically at higher risk of developing SSIs and therefore would be ideal for future
      investigations.

    <description>3-7 days before surgery, patients will receive 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vs. placebo) during their pre-op assessment. They will also have their baseline vitamin D status measured during this initial visit. The main study outcome is to determine if 100,000 IU cholecalciferol can be given preoperatively to safely boost vitamin D status. To assess vitamin D status, we will measure: 1) 25(OH)D; 2) 1,25(OH)2D; 3) PTH; 4) DBP; 5) LL37; 6) Albumin; and 7) Calcium levels.</description>

    <description>The goal is to determine whether pre-operative supplementation with 100,000 IU cholecalciferol (vs. placebo) alters the natural course of short-term changes in vitamin D status following surgery. To assess vitamin D status, we will measure: 1) 25(OH)D; 2) 1,25(OH)2D; 3) PTH; 4) DBP; 5) LL37; 6) Albumin; and 7) Calcium levels.</description>

    <description>The goal is to determine whether pre-operative supplementation with 100,000 IU cholecalciferol (vs. placebo) alters the natural course of changes in vitamin D status within 10-18 days after surgery. To assess vitamin D status, we will measure: 1) 25(OH)D; 2) 1,25(OH)2D; 3) PTH; 4) DBP; 5) LL37; 6) Albumin; and 7) Calcium levels.</description>

    <description>The goal is to determine whether pre-operative supplementation with 100,000 IU cholecalciferol (vs. placebo) alters the natural course of short-term post-surgical complications within 30 days after surgery. To assess the incidence of post-surgical complications, we will measure rates of: 1) anastomotic leak; 2) pneumonia; 3) urinary tract infection; 4) surgical site infection; 5) sepsis/bacteremia; and 6) mortality</description>
