  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx) is the gold standard method for
      prostat cancer diagnosis. Cancer detection rate is an important issue in TRUS-Bx. Effective
      biopsy protocol is necessary to enhance cancer detection rate during the procedure. Patient
      tolerance may improve the protocol effectiveness and quality.

      Adequate patient tolerance with optimal local anesthesia may enhance cancer detection rate
      in TRUS-Bx.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy ultrasound's probe  manipulation is
      necessary for effective biopsy. Patient discomfort and pain frequently occurs with
      manipulation of probe during  transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy and this
      situation  may qualify of the achievement of this procedure.

      In this study, we aimed to describe the impact of different two local anesthesia types on
      cancer detection rate in transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.
