The standard treatment\n      is based on whole brain radiation therapy and local treatment of metastases as neurosurgery\n      or radiosurgery. However, many cases can not receive a standard local treatment, and local\n      relapse occurs in almost 50% of cases treated with only whole brain irradiation. There are\n      retrospective studies of increased radiation dose at the site of metastasis with\n      hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) with favorable results, but there are no\n      controlled studies regarding the safety of radiation dose in these situations. This study is\n      a phase I study to evaluate the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) with HSRT as a way to increase\n      the dose of radiation after the WBRT for patients with 1-3 brain metastases not eligible for\n      surgery or RS."
