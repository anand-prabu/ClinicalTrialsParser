  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Age Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the first cause of blindness in industrialized
      countries. The macular pigment (lutein and zeaxanthin) could play an important role in the
      arisen of the AMD. The food supplementation by corn with strong concentration in macular
      pigment could increase the density of the macular pigment. This could, in the future,
      represent a strategy of prevention of the AMD. The main objective of this study is to detect
      an increase of the macular pigment density after the consumption of this corn at healthy
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The age macular degeneration represents the first cause of blindness in industrialized
      countries if it is not treated. In France, the AMD affects 600 000 persons and this figure
      should continue to increase, notably because of the increase of the life expectancy. The
      macula is responsible of the fine vision, the vision of colours and the perception of
      contrasts. The macular pigment is present only at the level of the macular area. This
      pigment is composed of three carotenoids: lutein, zeaxanthin, meso-zeaxanthin. The first two
      compounds are of strictly food origin and are not produced in an endogenous way. A change of
      the macular pigment density and/or the quality of the macular pigment is suspected to play a
      role in the appearance and the evolution of the AMD. The food supplementation by corn with
      strong concentration in macular pigment could increase the density of the macular pigment.
      This could, in the future, represent a strategy of prevention of the AMD. The main objective
      of this study is to detect an increase of the macular pigment density after the consumption
      of this corn at healthy volunteers. The treatment will consist in a daily consumption of a
      box of 125g of corn with strong zeaxanthin content during 10 weeks. This corresponds to a
      daily contribution of at least 1,2 mg of lutein and 2,2 mg de zeaxanthin. After the
      inclusion visit, the subject will be seen 5 times (after 3, 6, 8, 10, 14 weeks of
      treatment). In all these visits, measures of the macular pigment will be realized. A blood
      sample will be realized at the inclusion visit and during the visit at 6 and 10 weeks.
