  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced solid tumors, including glioma,
      that harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase
      where cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study
      is a dose expansion phase where three cohorts of patients will receive AG-120 to further
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the MTD. Anticipated time on
      study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be ≥18 years of age.

          2. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors,
             including glioma, that have recurred or progressed following standard therapy, or
             that have not responded to standard therapy.

          3. Subjects must have documented IDH1 gene-mutated disease based on local test
             evaluation.

          4. Subject must have evaluable disease by RECIST v1.1 for subjects without glioma or by
             RANO criteria for subjects with glioma.

          5. Subjects must be amenable to serial peripheral blood sampling, urine sampling, and
             biopsies during the study.
