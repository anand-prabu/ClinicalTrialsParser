  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family caregivers are vulnerable to health problems because of the stress and demands of
      their role as a caregiver. With the growing incidence of heart failure (HF) and the
      anticipated growth in the aging population, the number of HF caregivers is expected to rise.
      This study will pilot test a cognitive behavioral intervention designed to reduce stress
      among HF caregivers, which will ultimately contribute to promoting health and quality of
      life among HF caregivers and their loved ones with HF.
