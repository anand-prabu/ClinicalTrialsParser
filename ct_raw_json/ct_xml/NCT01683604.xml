    <textblock>
      This multi-center, observational study will evaluate the treatment patterns in clinical
      practice, efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis who have had an inadequate response (or were intolerant to) treatment with
      non-biological DMARDs or with one biological agent. Data will be collected from each
      eligible patient initiated on RoActemra/Actemra treatment by their treating physician
      according to approved label for 6 months from start of treatment.
