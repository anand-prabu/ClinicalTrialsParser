  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of paliperidone
      palmitate over a 9-week period for participants with schizophrenia in Korea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center,
      prospective (look forward using observations collected following participant enrollment),
      non-comparative, non-randomized (the study medication is not assigned by chance), study.
      Safety and efficacy of paliperidone palmitate will be observed in Korean schizophrenic
      participants for 25 weeks. Approximately 3000 participants will be observed in this study
      and the study duration will be 25 weeks. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, concomitant medications, physical examination, and psychiatric history.

    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This PSP assesses the degree of a participants dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (i, absent to vi, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on the four domains there will be one total score. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; =&lt; 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>
