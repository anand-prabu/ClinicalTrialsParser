  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate whether the drug BMN 673 has therapeutic benefit in the
      treatment of advanced endometrial cancer. Nearly 8,000 patients are diagnosed with
      endometrial cancer in the UK every year. A significant proportion are either diagnosed with
      advanced disease which may be inoperable and/or metastatic (i.e spread to other organs
      outside the endometrium), or curable disease which relapses following first line treatment.
      There is no established standard of care for these patients as both chemo and hormone
      therapy has limited effectiveness and survival benefit. Survival rates have not improved in
      the past 20 years. Furthermore there are no so called 'targeted' drugs licensed for its
      treatment  i.e. drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with
      specific molecules involved in tumor growth and progression. This leaves an unmet need for
      effective systemic treatments for advanced, inoperable and metastatic endometrial cancer.

      BMN 673 has been shown to be potentially effective in treating cancers known to behave
      similarly to endometrial disease, both in the laboratory and in Phase I studies involving
      patients with advanced cancers. Similarly the drug appears to be relatively tolerable. A
      Phase II trial such as the one proposed by this application could demonstrate activity that
      might lead to a new effective treatment for patients with inoperable, advanced, recurrent or
      metastatic endometrial cancer, while the proposed substudy also presents the possibility of
      discovering a subset of patients more likely to derive benefit from BMN 673.

      This trial is for adult women (18 and above) with advanced, inoperable or metastatic
      endometrial cancer. Patients will be recruited from approximately 12 NHS Trusts based in the
      UK. The study is expected to last approximately 18-24 months in terms of recruitment time,
      and a maximum of 100 eligible women will be registered. All patients will receive BMN 673
      until their disease worsens or their doctor decides they should stop treatment.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Histologically confirmed endometrial cancer. All histological subtypes except for
             carcinosarcoma are eligible

          -  Evidence of inoperable, advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease by imaging and/or
             histological criteria

          -  ≤ 1 previous line of systemic cancer therapy for inoperable, advanced, recurrent or
             metastatic endometrial cancer. Chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is not considered
             a prior line of therapy unless recurrence occurred during adjuvant treatment or
             within 6 months of the last treatment; first line treatment of advanced disease must
             include at least one cytotoxic agent to be considered as a line of therapy; prior
             hormonal treatment is not considered a line of therapy in any setting

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any screening procedures

          -  Patients must give consent for analysis of archived histological diagnostic tissue
             for immunohistochemistry (IHC). If archived tissue is not available or is of
             insufficient quantity or quality, the patient will have the option to undergo biopsy
             if feasible. If biopsy is not feasible or the patient does not give consent for
             biopsy when archived tissue is not available, the patient will not be eligible for
             the trial. The quality and quantity of archived tissue will be assessed by a suitably
             qualified individual, usually a histopathologist, at site to ensure adequate tissue
             sample available for testing for PTEN, MSI and MRE11

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-2

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks

          -  Patient has at least one site of measurable disease (i.e. target lesion) per RECIST
             v1.1

          -  Evidence of non-childbearing status and must not be lactating OR must have
             postmenopausal status

          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor

          -  Progressive disease ≤3 months after platinum-based chemotherapy

          -  Active uncontrolled infection including known Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or HIV

          -  Obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract or other reason preventing effective oral
             administration of medication

          -  Serious concomitant non-malignant disease, uncontrolled organ dysfunction or medical
             disorder considered by the Investigator to make the subject unsuitable for trial
             participation including any psychiatric disorder that prevents informed consent

          -  Significant active cardiovascular disease

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases

          -  Immunosuppressant therapy or considered to be otherwise immunocompromised

          -  Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of registration or ongoing clinically significant
             post-surgical complications

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy (a single fraction of palliative radiotherapy is allowed
             provided that the site being treated is not subsequently used as a target lesion as
             per RECIST v1.1 for the purpose of assessing tumour response on trial), immunotherapy
             or other investigational therapy for cancer within 21 days of registration (42 days
             for nitrosoureas, mitomycin-C)

          -  Unresolved clinically significant toxicities from prior systemic therapy

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the agents or excipients to be administered

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the trial protocol

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancy with the exceptions of a) cone-biopsied
             in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri; b) basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin.
