Junctional wounds of interest are of the groin and the\n      surrogate of bleeding is distal pulse absence temporarily during brief mechanical\n      compression by devices at or near the groin. Data of differential device performance can\n      generate knowledge of effectiveness rates ranked by device (models of devices), which may\n      help in selecting prehospital devices for military and civilian trauma care."
