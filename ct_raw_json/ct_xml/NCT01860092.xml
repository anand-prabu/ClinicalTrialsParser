  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-approval study is being implemented to monitor the use of Argus II System in a
      larger US population than available within pre-approval studies.  An attempt will be made to
      include all eligible and willing subjects implanted with Argus II System in the United
      States.

      Safety data will be monitored to ensure continued acceptability of risks to study subjects.
      The utility (i.e. visual function and functional vision) and reliability of Argus II System
      will also be evaluated.

      There is no study hypothesis.

    <description>Visual function means how to the eye works (e.g. visual acuity). Visual function will be measured using the following test: Square Localization, Direction of Motion and Grating Visual Acuity (GVA).In addition to these tests, a photographic flash test will be performed with the System OFF only to determine if subjects' native residual vision is bare light perception or no light perception.</description>

    <description>Functional vision means how subjects perform in vision-related activities of daily living.  Function vision will be assessed using the Functional Low-Vision Observer Rated Assessment (FLORA).  A utilization questionnaire will also be administered to track how subjects are using the Argus II System.</description>

        Age 25 years or older; both males and females; with severe to profound retinitis
        pigmentosa; with bare or no light perception in both eyes or with retinal response to
        electrical stimulation; with previous history of useful form vision

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are adults, age 25 year or older;

          -  Have severe to profound retinitis pigmentosa;

          -  Bare light or no light perception in both eyes; if the patient has no residual light
             perception, then evidence of intact inner layer retina function must be confirmed;

          -  Have previous history of useful form vision.

          -  Aphakic or pseudophakic.  (If the patient is phakic prior to implant, the natural
             lens will be removed during the implant procedure.)

          -  Patients who are willing and able to receive the recommended post-implant clinical
             follow-up, device fitting, and visual rehabilitation;

          -  Have consented to the implantation of an Argus II Retinal Prosthesis and subsequently
             consent to participate in this study;

          -  At the time of the Baseline Visit, do not suffer from non-ophthalmic serious adverse
             events (e.g. myocardial infarction, etc.) and

          -  Live no more than 3 hours distance from the Site where medical follow-up and device
             fitting will be performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular diseases or conditions that could prevent Argus II System from working (e.g.
             optic nerve disease, central retinal artery or vein occlusion, history of retinal
             detachment, trauma, severe strabismus);

          -  Ocular structures or conditions that could prevent the successful implantation of the
             Argus II Implant or adequate healing from surgery (e.g. extremely thin conjunctiva,
             axial length &lt;20.5 mm or &gt;26 mm, corneal ulcers, etc.);

          -  Ocular diseases or conditions (other than cataracts) that prevent adequate
             visualization of the inner structures of the eye (e.g. corneal opacity, etc.);

          -  Inability to tolerate general anesthesia or the recommended antibiotic and steroid
             regimen associated with the implantation surgery;

          -  Metallic or active implantable device(s) (e.g. cochlear implant) in the head;

          -  Pre-disposition to eye rubbing;

          -  Any disease or condition that prevents understanding or communication of informed
             consent, study demands, and testing protocols, including:

               -  cognitive decline including diagnosed forms of dementia and/or progressive
                  neurologic disease,

               -  psychiatric disease including diagnosed forms of depression;

               -  does not speak a principal language associated with the region, and

               -  deafness;

          -  Pregnant or wish to become pregnant during the course of the study;

          -  Participating in another investigational drug or device study that may conflict with
             the objectives, follow-up or testing of this study;

          -  Conditions likely to limit life to less than 1 year from the time of inclusion.
