  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with hypertension are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and death so it is
      important to lower blood pressure to normal levels as quickly as possible. Previous research
      has established that renal nerve denervation successfully lowers blood pressure measured in
      the arm in the physician's office. This study is being conducted so that the investigators
      can determine whether renal nerve denervation also helps to lower blood pressure over 24
      hours, as well as central aortic blood pressure, which is pressure exerted by the aorta
      closer to the heart and may be a better predictor of cardiovascular problems. The
      investigators also want to know whether these beneficial effects on blood pressure can last
      up to 2 years, whether renal denervation reduces the number of medications patients need to
      take, and whether it reduces glucose and insulin levels in the blood since hypertension is
      also related to obesity and diabetes.

    <description>Symplicity Renal Denervation System consists of two main components: the Symplicity Catheter; and the Symplicity Radio Frequency Generator.The Symplicity Renal Denervation System is indicated for the delivery of low-level radiofrequency energy through the wall of the renal artery to denervate the kidney and reduce blood pressure in adult patients with refractory hypertension. The Symplicity Generator delivers controlled relatively low power radiofrequency energy (approximately 8 watts for 2 minutes). The Symplicity System selectively denervates the kidney by delivering radiofrequency from the generator via the electrode of the catheter through the renal artery wall from the intra-luminal side to ablate the renal sympathetic efferent and afferent nerves and reduce overall sympathetic nervous system activity.</description>
