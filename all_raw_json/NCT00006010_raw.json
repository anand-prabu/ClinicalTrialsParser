Treatment repeats every 3 weeks. Patients achieving complete response after\n      2 courses of therapy receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients with stable disease\n      or partial response continue therapy until disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2.5\n      years."
