    <textblock>
      This  study  aims  to  investigate  the  predictive  value  of  novel  biomarkers  and
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for early detection of abdominal end-organ (kidney and
      intestinum) hypoperfusion and ischemia in patients undergoing endovascular aortic repair
      (EVAR) for aortic aneurysm or dissection. In this context, patients will  be monitored  for
      renal  biomarkers  (TIMP-2,  IGFBP7)  and  intestinal  biomarkers  (plasmatic intestinal
      fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP))  and local tissue perfusion will be assessed using
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS).

      The ultimate goal of this study is an early identification of patients developing one or
      both of these complications, which may facilitate a timely intervention to improve outcome.
