  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA (ISTIA), who are treated at hospital are
      asked to participate in our pre specified hypertension health education protocol (HHEP)
      after discharge from our hospital.HHEP was used as secondary prevention treatments of stroke
      and cardiovascular diseases.

      HHEP consists of several items such as controlling the patient's hypertension level,
      monitoring the adherece of antihypertensive agents, reducing risk factors of hytertension
      like tobacco smoking, obesity, and motivating the patient to physical activity and to a
      healthy diet.

      Patients will receive visits by a study nurse with the aim of supervising, monitoring, and
      recording the adherence of HHEP. The patients will be classified as different adherence
      level at the end of the study according to their adherence condition.

      This study is aimed at testing the hypothesis that controlling hypertension and its risk
      factors was more effective than those do not receive HHEP  in reducing the recurrence of
      stroke and cardiovascular diseases.
