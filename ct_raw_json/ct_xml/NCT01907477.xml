    <textblock>
      The aim of the present work is to study the protein expressions profiles of neutropenic
      patients (with a high risk of invasive mycosis) who developed - versus who did not develop
      invasive mycosis (principally aspergillosis and candidosis) in order to identify biomarkers
      for the diagnosis, prognosis and /or prediction of invasive mycosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  - Patients with malignant haemopathy who received chemotherapy likely to lead to
             severe neutropenia (PN&lt;500/mm3) for a foreseeable period of 10 days.

          -  Patients aged 14 years or older (no upper age limit)

          -  Patients with malignant haemopathy who received an autologous marrow graft.

          -  Patients with severe idiopathic medullar aplasia (PN&lt;500/mm3) who need to be
             hospitalised for at least 10 days consecutively (with or without immunosuppressant
             treatment).

          -  Patients who have provided written informed consent to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received an allograft of marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplant
             (given that these patients carry a risk of aspergillosis, which in most cases appears
             after medullar recovery, they will not be included in the study).

          -  Patients who received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (given that
             the duration of the neutropenia is often less than 10 days).

          -  Patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria

          -  Persons not covered by the national Health Insurance Agency
