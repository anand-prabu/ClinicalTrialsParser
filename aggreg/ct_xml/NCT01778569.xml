      Background:

      - Cardiometabolic diseases are medical disorders that can occur together and affect the
      heart. They increase the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes. One disorder,
      psoriasis, is an inflammation that mostly affects the skin but can affect the entire body.
      Another disorder, atherosclerosis, is a process in which cholesterol is gradually deposited
      on the wall of arteries. This causes arteries to harden and become less flexible. Many cells
      that cause psoriasis also cause atherosclerosis. Researchers want to look at the
      relationship between cardiometabolic diseases and psoriasis.

      Objectives:

      - To study the relationship between psoriasis and cardiometabolic diseases.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have psoriasis.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Participants will have up to seven outpatient visits over the 4 years. The first visit
           will be a screening visit. Visits 2 and 3 will be 6 and 12 months after visit 1. Visits
           4, 5, and 6 will be scheduled yearly for the next 3 years. If participants have a
           psoriasis flare with more severe symptoms, they may have an extra visit. Those who
           leave the study early will have a final visit with the full series of tests.

        -  At visits 1, 3, and 6, and any flare visits, participants will have a physical exam and
           medical history. They will provide blood and urine samples, as well as optional tissue
           biopsies. They will also have heart function tests. Imaging studies, as well as
           optional photographs of affected areas, will be performed. These tests will also be
           performed at the final visit.

        -  At visits 2, 4, and 5, participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They
           will also provide blood and urine samples, and have heart function tests.

    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, inflammation has been identified as an important pathogenic
      process in cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD),
      dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity. However, mechanistic links between
      inflammation and these disease states in humans remain poorly understood. In this study, we
      propose to utilize psoriasis, a common, chronic inflammatory T-cell skin disease associated
      with increased CVD and CMD as a model to understand the effect of chronic inflammation on
      these diseases states. We will conduct a prospective cohort study to understand the effect
      of chronic inflammation on vascular and metabolic disease at the NIH Clinical Center.
      Furthermore, we will initiate a large scale collection of blood and skin from extramural
      sites to facilitate discovery of pathways involved in inflammatory modulation of CVD and CMD

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

             18 years of age or older

        diagnosed with psoriasis clinically confirmed by an expert physician, consisting of
        typical skin findings and associated findings of systemic disease of joints, nails and
        hair)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        For skin and adipose biopsy, any subject with known bleeding disorder, current fever or on
        anticoagulation.

        For imaging studies, pregnant women and lactating women, unless they are willing to
        discard breast milk for 24 hours after receiving FDG or contrast

        Subjects with a contraindication to MRI scanning will not receive the optional PET/MRI.
        These contraindications include subjects with the following devices:

        Central nervous system aneurysm clips

        Implanted neural stimulator

        Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator

        Cochlear implant

        Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)

        Implanted Insulin pump

        Metal shrapnel or bullet

        Subjects with a BMI &gt; 40 will also not receive the PET MRI.

        Subjects with severe renal excretory dysfunction, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;
        30 mL/min/1.73m2 body surface area according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
        criteria, will not receive the cardiac CT angiography, or gadolinium contrast agent during
        the PET/MRI.
