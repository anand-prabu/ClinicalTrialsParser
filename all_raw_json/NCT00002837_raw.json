            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Define the maximum tolerated doses of four courses of doxorubicin (DOX),\n      paclitaxel (TAX), and cyclophosphamide (CTX) followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)\n      and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support given in an out-patient setting in\n      patients with metastatic breast cancer. II. Evaluate the cardiotoxicity of the combination\n      of bolus DOX, a 3-hour infusion of TAX, and CTX. III. Determine the clinical response rate\n      and time to progression associated with this regimen. IV. Determine Cmax, AUC and the\n      drug:metabolite ratio of TAX and DOX when given with CTX, a known p450 inducer.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients without prior doxorubicin (DOX) or paclitaxel (TAX) receive two courses of\n      induction chemotherapy with DOX/TAX with G-CSF support given 3 weeks apart. Peripheral blood\n      stem cells (PBSC) are harvested during the recovery phase following the second course.\n      Patients who previous received DOX or TAX and responded receive cyclophosphamide (CTX) with\n      G-CSF for stem cell mobilization followed by PBSC harvest. Back-up bone marrow may be\n      harvested from patients without marrow involvement for whom PBSC collection is inadequate.\n      Patients with responding or stable disease who have adequate PBSC available receive\n      dose-intensive chemotherapy with DOX, CTX, and TAX given on day 1, with PBSC infused on day\n      3 and G-CSF given from day 3 until neutrophil recovery. Four courses of dose-intensive\n      chemotherapy with PBSC and G-CSF support are given every 3-4 weeks. During the phase I\n      portion of the study, groups of 3-6 patients are treated at increasing doses of DOX, TAX,\n      and CTX until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined; during the phase II portion,\n      additional patients are treated at the MTD. Patients who progress after 2 courses of\n      induction or 2 courses of dose-intensive chemotherapy are given the option of receiving\n      their PBSC after conditioning with a different regimen (e.g., CTX, etoposide, and\n      cisplatin). Patients who receive induction on protocol but who choose not to receive\n      dose-intensive chemotherapy continue DOX/TAX for a total of 6 courses. Patients are followed\n      3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after therapy, then as clinically indicated.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: During the phase I portion of the study, groups of 3-6 patients will be\n      entered at each dose level studied. During the phase II portion of the study, 25 patients\n      will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose."
