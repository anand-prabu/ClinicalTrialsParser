To assess these deficits\n      and the application of a novel approach of cognitive stimulation to alcoholics, we have\n      carried out a neuropsychological intervention program with mobile health technology.\n      Patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence syndrome were submitted to cognitive stimulation\n      during four weeks in a three-day/week basis."
