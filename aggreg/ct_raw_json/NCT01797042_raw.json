In\n      addition to the well know lipogenic effects, more recent evidence has shown that the acute\n      changes in hormones and metabolic parameters that control appetite and energy regulation\n      when with fructose consumption may promote caloric overconsumption and, in the long-term,\n      weight gain.  However, fructose is rarely consumed in isolation, but instead is consumed in\n      combination with other sugars (with glucose in the case of the two most common sources of\n      fructose: high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and sucrose, or as part of a mixed macronutrient\n      meal.  As such, the practical significance of these short-term findings of isolated\n      monosaccharide consumption is limited.\n\n      AIM 1: investigate the response to ten weeks of daily consumption of different fructose\n      containing sugars and glucose at typical intake levels on various metabolic parameters and\n      on fat content of the liver and skeletal muscle.\n\n      AIM 2: To investigate whether ten weeks of daily consumption changes the acute metabolic\n      response when these sugars are consumed as part as mixed nutrient meals."
