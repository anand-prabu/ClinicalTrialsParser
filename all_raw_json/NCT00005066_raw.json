Determine the\n      duration of response, time to progression, and survival of these patients treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed 1 hour later by\n      carmustine IV over 15 minutes. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses\n      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with progressive\n      disease are followed every 6 months until death. Patients without progressive disease are\n      followed every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 14\n      months."
