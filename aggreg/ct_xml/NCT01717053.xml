  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of abiraterone acetate to standard treatment of radiotherapy and short-term
      androgen deprivation will increase the frequency of undetectable PSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm two-site study of 37 men with unfavorable prostate cancer (defined as
      having a single high risk factor). Patients will concurrently initiate 6 months of
      standard-of-care GNRH agonist therapy and once daily abiraterone acetate/prednisone. After 2
      months of lead-in hormonal treatment, definitive standard-of-care prostate/seminal vesicle
      radiotherapy will be delivered, to a total dose of 75-80 Gy.
