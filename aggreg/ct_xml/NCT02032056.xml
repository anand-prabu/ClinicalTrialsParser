  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the intervention is to examine the effect of the bacterial strain BB-12, provided
      for 6 mo, on the prevalence of infections and allergic manifestations in small children, and
      how BB-12 affects the immune system, the gastrointestinal tract and the microbiota. Children
      are enrolled during 2 winter seasons.
