Positive immunohistochemistry finding of myocardial inflammation in endomyocardial\n             biopsy (EMB). EMB must have been be performed no more than 6 weeks prior to the\n             inclusion in the study. Positive immunohistochemistry EMB finding demonstrating\n             myocardial inflammation is defined by the presence of at least 7/mm2 cluster of\n             differentiation 3 (CD3) positive lymphocytes and/or at least 14 infiltrating\n             leucocytes (LCA+ cells)/mm2 in the specimen.\n\n          5.
