The aim\n      of this study is to collect clinical information on the performance of the Endurant Stent\n      Graft System for endovascular repair in anatomically challenging aneurysms, and to\n      critically assess whether the current guidelines for anatomic eligibility to endovascular\n      treatment with this system are still applicable. This study aims at creating a database that\n      can be pooled/ compared with the ENGAGE database.\n\n      This study aims at answering two major questions:\n\n        1. Is the technical success rate of successful delivery and deployment of the Endurant\n           (II) similar in anatomically challenging aneurysm?\n\n        2. Is the successful treatment rate comparable in anatomically challenging aneurysms, or\n           does treatment of these aneurysms lead to more complications and reinterventions?"
