So far, no studies have examined MCT in comparison with the best documented\n      and evidence based treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment(CBT), in a randomized\n      controlled trial consisting of mixed anxiety disorder sample with high degree of\n      comorbidity.\n\n      The main aim of this study is to 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of metacognitive therapy in a\n      sample of mixed anxiety disorders as compared to a group receiving existing evidence-based\n      single diagnosis CBT- treatment protocols 2) Investigate patterns and mechanisms of change\n      in the two treatments."
