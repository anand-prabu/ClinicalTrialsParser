In our project, this term applies both to Dubreuilh's melanosis and to\n      Dubreuilh's intraepidermal melanoma. It consequently excludes invasive melanoma. Although\n      surgery is the treatment of choice, it remains without consensus on the margins (5 mm or 10\n      mm) excision for a localized tumor on the face.\n\n      Several studies have shown that imiquimod, activating local immunity by interferon\n      production, induced LM or MLM regression and could also decrease the frequency of relapses.\n\n      The principal aim of our project is to study the effect of imiquimod versus vehicle in\n      pre-operative neoadjuvant treatment aimed at reducing both surgical margins, as from the\n      first surgical procedure, and the frequency of short and medium term recurrence of LM.\n      Furthermore, the improvement in patient quality of life could also be significant."

Furthermore, the improvement\n      in patient quality of life could also be significant.\n\n      The number of patients to be included in the study is 268.\n\n      For each patient, the study will involve several stages (S), as follows:\n\n      S0 (Selection): information and obtaining of the patient's informed consent. Performance of\n      biopsy for histological confirmation of LM\n\n      S1 (S0 + ~ 2 weeks): patient inclusion following anatomopathological confirmation of LM.\n      Patient randomisation in one or other study arm: imiquimod versus placebo and initiation of\n      topical treatment.\n\n      S2 (S1 + 4 weeks): Discontinuation of imiquimod/placebo application. Scheduling of the\n      surgical procedure 4 weeks later.\n\n      S3 (S2 + 4 weeks): Surgery.\n\n      S4: After the last surgical procedure, simple clinical follow up will be ensured every 6\n      months for a period of 3 years, in order to study the recurrence rate."
