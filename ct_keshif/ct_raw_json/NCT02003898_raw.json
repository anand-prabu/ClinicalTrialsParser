Two separate Hemoglobin A1C tests should be documented for each subject within 6\n             months of Screening. The A1C tests should meet the following criteria:\n\n               -  They should have been taken a minimum of 90 days apart while on sensor augmented\n                  pump therapy\n\n               -  They should not differ by more than an absolute value of 0.5% (e.g. 7% vs. 7.5%,\n                  9% vs. 9.5%)\n\n               -  They should be verifiable via source documentation\n\n               -  They should have been run by the same method/assay which may include Point of\n                  Care or local laboratory measurements. The assay should be NGSP (National\n                  Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program) certified. For example: Both A1Cs\n                  should have been measured by the same model POC (point-of-care) machine or both\n                  tests should have been processed in the same lab.\n\n          3. Subject has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and has been treated with combined\n             basal/bolus insulin therapy for at least one year prior to screening. Two examples of\n             combined basal/bolus insulin therapy:\n\n               -  Insulin pump therapy\n\n               -  Insulin injection with use of long acting insulin analog such as glargine or\n                  detemir with rapid acting analog such as aspart, lispro and glulisine\n\n          4. Subject is on sensor-augmented pump therapy for at least 91 days prior to screening.\n             CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) use will be defined as having worn CGM for at\n             least 60% of the time in the last 3 months (Criteria for CGM use will be validated by\n             subject report and by pump upload which shows the subject wearing the sensor at least\n             60% of the time in the last 2 weeks prior to screening).\n\n          5. Subject is currently transitioning from SAP (Sensor Augmented Pump) to SAP using the\n             530G (Model identifier) insulin pump with TS (Threshold Suspend) feature\n\n          6. Subject is willing to perform greater than or equal to 4 finger stick blood glucose\n             measurements daily\n\n          7. Subject is willing to perform required sensor calibrations\n\n          8. Subject is willing to wear the system (Pump, sensors, meter) continuously throughout\n             the study\n\n          9. Subject is willing to upload data every 21 days from the study pump\n\n         10. Subject must have Internet access and access to a computer system that meets the\n             requirements for uploading the pumps. This may include use of family or friend's\n             computer system with Internet access.\n\n         11. Subject is able (by insurance or financial means) to cover the initial investment and\n             ongoing cost of the 530G insulin pump and consumables, CGM, BG (Blood Glucose) meter\n             and supplies for 1 year.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device)\n             wherein he/she has received treatment from an investigational study drug or\n             investigational study devices in the last 2 weeks.\n\n          2. Women of child-bearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test at screening or\n             plan to become pregnant during the course of the study\n\n          3. Subject is being treated for hyperthyroidism at time of screening\n\n          4. Subject has an abnormality (>1.8mg/dL) in creatinine at time of screening visit\n\n          5. Subject has an abnormality (out of reference range) in thyroid-stimulating hormone\n             (TSH) at time of screening visit\n\n          6. If TSH is out of range, Free T3 and Free T4 will be tested\n\n          7. Subject may be included with TSH out of range as long as Free T3 and Free T4 are in\n             normal reference range.\n\n          8. Subject has taken any oral, injectable, or IV steroids within 8 weeks from time of\n             screening visit, or plans to take any oral, injectable, or IV steroids during the\n             course of the study\n\n          9. Subject is currently abusing illicit drugs\n\n         10. Subject is currently abusing prescription drugs\n\n         11. Subject is currently abusing alcohol\n\n         12. Subject has a sickle cell disease, hemoglobinopathy; or has received red blood cell\n             transfusion or erythropoietin within 3 months prior to time of screening\n\n         13. Subject plans to receive red blood cell transfusion or erythropoietin over the course\n             of study participation\n\n         14. Subject diagnosed with current eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia\n\n         15. Subject has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease that results in chronic anemia\n\n         16.
