There is an urgent need to develop effective treatments to reduce both the\n      intensity of these Veterans' current symptoms as well as their potential long-term risks for\n      developing neurodegenerative dementing disorders related to repetitive mTBI: chronic\n      traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Converging evidence suggests\n      that statins may possess neuroprotective effects against pathologic processes related to tau\n      protein metabolism that appear to be a common feature of CTE, AD, and other\n      neurodegenerative sequelae of repetitive mTBI.\n\n      We propose a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to establish\n      proof-of-concept for use of simvastatin (40 mg/d) for decreasing CSF biomarkers of\n      neurodegeneration and increasing CSF neurotrophins in 120 Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with\n      repetitive blast trauma mTBI."
