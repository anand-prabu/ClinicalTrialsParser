      To attest if a cardiac fatigue appears (and to measure it if it does) during intense
      physical exercises in two groups of subjects:

        -  Canoeists from a training center (Cesson-Sévigné) of the French canoeing team during an
           intensive session of three weeks of endurance training;

        -  Young recruits in military school of officers in ground forces of the French army
           (Saint-Cyr Coëtquidan) during an intensive.
