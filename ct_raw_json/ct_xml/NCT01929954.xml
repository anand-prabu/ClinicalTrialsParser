  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group Phase 1/2 assessment of the
      safety of GINTUIT versus Bio-Gide in subjects who have a posterior tooth requiring
      extraction. The incidence and severity of adverse events will be summarized by group
      (GINTUIT and Bio-Gide).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age but no more than 75 years of age.

          -  Subject has a posterior (molar or premolar) socket created by atraumatic extraction
             with a post extraction socket of a minimum of 5 mm in both the mesial-distal (M-D)
             and buccal-lingual (B-L) dimensions that requires bone grafting.

          -  Subject has sufficient buccal bone plate at the site of the planned tooth extraction
             (ie, the residual socket should be of a form that would retain bone graft material),
             as judged by the Principal Investigator.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative urine pregnancy
             test. All subjects must agree to use acceptable methods of contraception for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Subjects must have read, understood, and signed an institutional review board
             (IRB)-approved Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to comply with protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with any systemic conditions that could compromise wound healing and preclude
             periodontal surgery (ie, bleeding disorder, cancer, except localized basal cell or
             squamous cell cancer of the skin with no metastasis; human immunodeficiency virus; or
             bone metabolic diseases [ie, osteoporosis or Paget's disease]).

          -  Subject who is currently receiving, anticipates receiving or has received within 30
             days prior to Day 0: inhaled or systemic corticosteroids (ie, oral, IV),
             immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, which could
             compromise wound healing and preclude periodontal surgery.

          -  Subject who has had oral/periodontal surgery within 30 days prior to Day 0 or
             anticipates having oral/periodontal surgery within 30 days after Day 0.

          -  Subject with acute mucosal infection, including suppuration or induration in the area
             of intended surgery.

          -  Subject, who in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, will require a sinus lift
             procedure to place dental implants in the surgical area.

          -  Subject without at least 1 tooth adjacent to the area to be treated.

          -  Subject has a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the previous 12 months of
             Screening that could interfere with study compliance or protocol requirements.

          -  Subject who has used any tobacco product within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Subject with known hypersensitivity to porcine or bovine collagen, gentamicin or
             surfactants.

          -  Subject who has received an investigational drug, device, or biological/bioactive
             treatment within 30 days prior to Day 0 (medical or dental).

          -  Subject who was previously treated with Gintuit, or any other cell therapy at the
             target treatment site or immediately adjacent teeth.

          -  Female subject that is lactating.

          -  Subject, who in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, for any reason other than
             those listed above, will not be able to complete the study per protocol.
