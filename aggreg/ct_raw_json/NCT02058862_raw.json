Strength will be evaluated via isometric knee extension, neuromuscular\n      inhibition will be assessed via a superimposed burst technique, and cortical excitability\n      will be assessed via transcranial magnetic stimulation. In addition, we will evaluate\n      function through a single-leg hop task, star excursion balance test, and a step down task.\n      Patient reported outcomes will be assessed via the: Veterans Rand 12 Item Health Survey\n      (VR-12), Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS), the International Cartilage Repair\n      Society (ICRS), the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee\n      Evaluation Form, and the Lysholm scale.\n\n      Once a participant is identified as eligible and consents to enroll in the study, they will\n      be allocated to either an intervention or control group. The participants in the\n      intervention group will receive a knee sleeve that has a neuromuscular ES unit embedded into\n      the garment (EMPI Phoenix, DJO Global, Vista, California) in addition to SOC. A superimposed\n      electrical signal (maximal toleration) will be utilized during treatment in order to\n      successfully overload the muscle.  During the electrical stimulation the participants will\n      be instructed to perform an isometric contraction and hold this contraction through the\n      length of the stimulation.  Beginning one week post-operatively the participants will be\n      instructed to perform NMES treatment 3 times a day for 20 minutes 5 times a week for 12\n      weeks. The stimulation will be delivered at a frequency of 75Hz with a duty cycle of 4\n      seconds on and 10 seconds off. The control group will be treated with the current SOC,\n      performing a home-based treatment of volitional isometrics contractions without the addition\n      of neuromuscular electrical stimulation beginning on the third day post-operatively.\n      Participants will perform 20 isometric contractions holding each contraction for 10 seconds\n      3 times a day 5 times a week for 12 weeks. Participants will be instructed to keep a\n      treatment log documenting at each session how many exercises and at what intensity they\n      performed."
