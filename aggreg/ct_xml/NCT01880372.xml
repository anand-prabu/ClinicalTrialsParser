      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of alpha lipoic acid in patients who have
      moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

      The primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the addition of alpha lipoic
      acid in a diabetic patient's therapeutic regimen can decrease the progression of diabetic
      retinopathy and preserve visual acuity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased production of free radicals and depletion of antioxidants are commonly observed in
      diabetic patients. Based on animal studies, increased production of free radicals tends to
      persist even after blood glucose is tightly controlled. The rationale of using a potent
      antioxidant is based on the observation that increased oxidative stress associated with
      hyperglycemia can contribute to cellular injury leading to apoptosis; consequently, leading
      to diabetic retinopathy. Evidence from animal model showed that alpha lipoic acid (a potent
      antioxidant) was effective for decreasing the progression of diabetic retinopathy and in
      reducing free radicals.

      Therefore, we hypothesize that therapy that can exert a powerful antioxidant activity can
      provide a therapeutic modality needed to target the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.

      This study will be a 12-month pilot study demonstrating the role of alpha lipoic acid in
      patients who have moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to two groups, treatment and control groups. Patients
      in the treatment group will receive 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid daily with routine care
      while patient in control group will only follow routine care. Optical coherence tomography
      (OCT)and electronic visual acuity testing algorithm (ETDRS) will be used to measure changes
      in retinal thickness and visual acuity respectively. Blood changes in macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (M-CSF), vascular endothelia growth factor (VEGF), Interferon 2 alpha,
      interleukin 6 and 8 will also be evaluated and compared between the two groups. Descriptive
      statistics and intention to treat analysis will be used to compare treatment and control
      groups.
