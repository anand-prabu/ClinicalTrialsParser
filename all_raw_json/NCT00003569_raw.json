Chemoprotective drugs such as dimesna may protect normal cells\n      from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of dimesna in\n      treating patients with solid tumors who are receiving cisplatin and paclitaxel."

Patients then receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by dimesna IV over\n      15-30 minutes followed immediately by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 every 3 weeks.\n      Patients continue courses of paclitaxel, dimesna, and cisplatin every 3 weeks in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 6 courses.\n\n      In stage I, cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of dimesna until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no\n      more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD of dimesna is\n      then used in stage II of the study, in which the volume of pre and post cisplatin\n      intravenous saline hydration is reduced in cohorts of 3-6 patients each. The MTD intensity\n      of cisplatin is defined as the least saline hydration volume at which no more than 1 of 6\n      patients experience DLT.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued into this study."
