Treatment continues\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before therapy and then every 4 weeks during therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 12 weeks until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
