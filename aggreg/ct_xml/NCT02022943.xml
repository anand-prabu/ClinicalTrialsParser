  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Alzheimer's Prevention Registry (www.endALZnow.org) will collect contact and demographic
      information on individuals. The objective is to provide information the latest news and
      advances in Alzheimer's prevention research, and to inform enrollees about research studies
      in their community. Enrolled individuals will receive regular email communications. As
      research studies become available, individuals will be notified via email with information
      as to how proceed should they be interested. Registry enrollees are under no obligation to
      participate in a research study.  Study opportunities may include surveys, healthy lifestyle
      interventions (e.g., diet, exercise), memory &amp; thinking tests, brain scans, and
      investigational drug trials. To join the Registry, please visit www.endALZnow.org
