It depends on physician's skill and situation. The\n      best regimen is patient-controlled analgesia, but it requires an expensive equipment.\n      Transdermal fentanyl patch, usually used in chronic pain relief, can steadily release\n      fentanyl into blood stream for 72 hours, but it has slow onset of 12 hours.\n\n      Hypothesis: If Transdermal fentanyl patch is applied 10-12 hours before surgery, it may\n      provide good analgesia for 72 hours."
