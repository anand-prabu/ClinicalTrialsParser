Therefore, more ideal evaluation of\n      interchangeability from the brand AEDs to generic formulation of the same drug is three-way\n      or four-way crossover study, which can evaluate within-subject variability in\n      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic. Investigator designed three-way crossover study aimed\n      to assess bioequivalence of brand and generic topiramate, to measure scaled average\n      bioequivalence, and to evaluate tolerability and side effect of generic topiramate."
