Studies have shown that, by taking a combination of anti-HIV drugs,\n      it is possible to reduce the amount of HIV in the body to almost undetectable levels. This\n      study will find out if starting anti-HIV drugs during primary infection will interrupt or\n      reduce the spread of HIV in patients' bodies."

Preliminary studies of combination antiretroviral therapy\n      show that it is possible to reduce circulating HIV RNA to below detectable levels at this\n      phase. Sustained suppression of viral replication or viral eradication may be possible only\n      before HIV has become integrated in the immune system and undergone a number of quasi\n      species mutations. This study will assess the feasibility of interrupting the natural course\n      of HIV infection by using antiretroviral therapy soon after initial infection.\n\n      Nelfinavir (NFV) and zidovudine/lamivudine (Combivir) treatment starts as soon as possible\n      and at most, 7 days from the diagnosis of HIV infection, and continues for 104 weeks. After\n      4 weeks of therapy patients are randomized to begin receiving IL-2 therapy or to delay\n      starting it until Week 48. Patients may choose not to receive IL-2 treatment and remain in\n      the study. Patients have clinic visits to measure viral load every 4 weeks. At a final\n      clinic visit, physical examinations and collection of semen, cervical fluid, blood, and\n      saliva specimens are done. Eligible consenting patients have a tonsil biopsy. Patients are\n      reimbursed for participation in this study."
