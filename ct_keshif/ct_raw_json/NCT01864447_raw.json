Subjects have an exercise expenditure goal of >3000 kcal/wk, attained after 2 to 4 weeks of gradually lengthening exercise bouts.  All exercise sessions will be performed onsite for the first two weeks, after which subjects will perform 2 additional sessions a week in the home environment.  Exercise logs will be reviewed weekly.\nThe Dietary Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention(BWL) intervention consists primarily of 12 small group sessions led by a dietician emphasizing dietary records, itemization of food, and caloric content. Subjects will be given individualized daily caloric goals 500 kcal less than predicted maintenance calories based on their baseline body weight."

            "textblock": "Cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a formalized exercise and behavioral modification program, is\n      the cornerstone of secondary prevention for heart disease. Implementation of CR early after\n      an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with improved cardiac function and\n      survival. As such, CR is now standard of care for a majority of hospital-based discharge\n      programs following coronary events.  In stark contrast, no similar program exists following\n      an acute venous thromboembolism (VTE or blood clot), despite a high rate of limb and\n      respiratory disability after VTE, shared risk factors with heart disease, and known\n      beneficial impact of exercise training on VTE complications (e.g. post-thrombotic syndrome,\n      PTS).\n\n      Body weight is a key modifiable risk factor driving risk of incident and recurrent VTE.\n      Obese patients with prior VTE have a 2-fold higher risk of a second VTE compared to normal\n      weight patients.(1) Importantly, VTE recurrence risk escalates if weight control is not\n      established. Weight gain after acute DVT is common, with a mean 7% increase over 6\n      months.(2) To date, however, there is limited evidence regarding whether early initiation of\n      exercise training following acute DVT is safe and feasible and mitigates weight gain\n      associated with a VTE diagnosis. Previously, a significant decrease in body weight and fat\n      mass loss was demonstrated utilizing high-caloric expenditure exercise in the CR setting.(3)\n       Delineating the impact of high-caloric expenditure exercise to induce weight loss and\n      reduce VTE complications and recurrence is a critical first step toward evaluating the role\n      of early post-VTE rehabilitation in the clinical setting."
