After the first day,\n      patients take pyrimethamine or placebo 3 times a week. Patients also take leucovorin calcium\n      orally three times weekly. Enrollment occurs over approximately 12 months. All patients are\n      followed on study until a common study close-out date and final analysis of the study.  It\n      is anticipated that this common close-out will occur when the mean duration of time on study\n      therapy will be 3 years (approximately in January, 1994).\n\n      ORIGINAL design: On the first day of treatment, patients receive a loading dose of\n      pyrimethamine or placebo, plus of leucovorin calcium. After the first day, patients take\n      pyrimethamine or placebo three times a week. Patients also take folinic acid orally three\n      times weekly. The mean duration of study participation is 3 years."
