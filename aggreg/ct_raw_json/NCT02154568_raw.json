To validate these models, they are seeking to obtain\n      experimental data of airflow in human lungs, both healthy and diseased. An assessment of\n      airflow can be obtained by using hyperpolarized noble gas (HNG) magnetic resonance imaging\n      (MRI) or, more specifically, hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe) MRI in conjunction with\n      flow-encoding schemes that are well-established in conventional proton MRI\n\n      Four chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and four healthy subjects will\n      undergo pulmonary function tests (PFTs), computed tomography (CT) scan covering the mouth,\n      neck, and chest, and hyperpolarized helium 3 MRI.  Before and after the MRI scans, three\n      spirometry readings will be taken while the subject is lying in the same position as in the\n      MR scanners.   Data will be analyzed by the BHSAI.  UVa will provide the de-identified raw\n      image data and the de-identified results of the spirometry and other tests to BHSAI"
