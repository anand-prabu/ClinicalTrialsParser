    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will study the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of single
      doses of MK-8892 in participants with PAH. The primary objective is to estimate the measured
      peak effect of the highest acutely tolerated (HAT) single oral dose of MK-8892 on pulmonary
      vascular resistance (PVR).

          -  PAH classified as World Health Organization (WHO) functional class II or III

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  has a medical history indicating a secondary cause of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) or
             a non-included etiology of PAH including the following tests within 6 months of Visit
             1: Echo indicating significant left heart disease, valvular disease, or structural
             defects; function test indicating significant pulmonary disease; imaging test
             indicating veno-occlusive disease; perfusion scan indicating thromboembolic disease;

             virus (HIV)
