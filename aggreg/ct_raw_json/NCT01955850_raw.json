In this study participants are randomized to: 1)\n      online cognitive-behavioral intervention; 2) face-to-face cognitive behavioral intervention;\n      3) waiting-list. Both the online and face-to-face interventions consist of: diary;\n      psycho-education; relaxation exercises; stimulus control/sleep hygiene; sleep restriction;\n      challenging the misconceptions about sleep; and paradoxical exercise. Adult persons with\n      insomnia will be invited via a popular scientific website to fill out online questionnaires.\n      Participants fill out questionnaires and a dairy at baseline post-test, 3-month follow-up,\n      and 6-month follow-up. Participants on the waiting-list receive online treatment after the\n      first post-test. The investigators expect that the online-delivered treatment and the\n      face-to-face treatment are equally effective."
