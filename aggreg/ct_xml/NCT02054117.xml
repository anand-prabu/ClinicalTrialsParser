  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding into the brain and is a major cause of stroke and other
      complications.  Brain injury from intracerebral hemorrhage occurs in two phases. The early
      phase involves the mechanical compression of brain tissue by the expanding hematoma. In a
      later phase, brain swelling develops causing further compression that may lead to brain
      herniation and death. This study investigates the neuroprotective role of haptoglobin, in
      minimizing the development of brain swelling following intracerebral hemorrhage.

    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage is bleeding into the brain parenchyma. It is a major cause of
      stroke, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Brain injury from
      intracerebral hemorrhage occurs in two phases. The early phase involves the mechanical
      compression of brain tissue by the expanding hematoma. In a later phase, brain edema,
      especially perihematomal edema, develops causing further compression that may lead to brain
      herniation and death. Several factors are implicated in the development of brain edema,
      including inflammation resulting from the oxidative stress caused by iron-rich hemoglobin
      released from lysed erythrocytes in brain tissue. This study investigates the
      neuroprotective role of an acute phase reactant, haptoglobin, in minimizing the development
      of perihematomal edema following intracerebral hemorrhage. This protein protects brain
      tissue from hemoglobin degradation products by forming haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes that
      are subsequently cleared by the spleen. Notably, different alleles of haptoglobin exist in
      humans, with varying affinities for hemoglobin. Investigating the association between the
      different alleles and the degree of perihematomal edema formation is the primary goal of
      this study. The investigators will also look at a marker of inflammation, matrix
      metalloproteinases, and analyze its level of expression in subjects with different alleles
      of haptoglobin.
