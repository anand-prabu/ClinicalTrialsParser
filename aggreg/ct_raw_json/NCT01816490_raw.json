            "textblock": "Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with\n      an estimated number of 180 million infected patients. Until 2012 the current standard of\n      care (SOC) treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C was a 24 to 72 weeks therapy with\n      pegylated interferon- and ribavirin (PR). In 2012, the protease-inhibitors (PI's) telaprevir\n      and boceprevir as first directly acting HCV drugs have been approved by the local Swiss\n      authority for hepatitis C mono-infected and HCV-HIV-co-infected individuals. However,\n      therapy success is strongly limited in null-responders (NR) to previous PR. Treatment of\n      HCV-HIV co-infected individuals with the new PI's is accompanied by additional challenges\n      (e.g. drug-drug interactions, toxicity, high pill burden). Patients with advanced fibrosis\n      are at highest risk for decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and\n      prompt initiation of treatment is strongly recommended. Recently, data in mono-infected\n      patients showed, that in prior non responders a 12 week course of a triple therapy (TT) with\n      telaprevir and PR followed by another 24 weeks of PR resulted in an sustained virologic\n      response (SVR) of only 29%. In HCV-HIV co-infected non-responders with unfavourable\n      preconditions (e.g. HCV-genotype 1, interleukin 28 B non-CC genotype, advanced liver\n      fibrosis, high baseline HCV viral load) SVR after TT is even expected to be lower. These\n      patients urgently need additional therapeutic options with the goal to eradicate HCV in\n      order to prevent further fibrosis progression and to reduce morbidity and mortality. A\n      promising substance in the field of drugs targeting the HCV replication is silibinin.\n      Silibinin is the main component of silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle Silybum\n      marianum. Intravenous silibinin (iSIL) targets multiple steps in the virus life cycle and\n      exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and immunomodulatory properties. iSIL\n      inhibits the HCV NS5B polymerase activity directly or by interfering with the binding of RNA\n      to this enzyme. In addition, iSIL appears to block virus entry, virus transmission and virus\n      secretion.In 2008 Ferenci et al. for the first time reported the substantial clinical\n      antiviral-effect of intravenous silibinin (iSIL) against HCV in PR non-responders. The\n      administration of 20mg/kg iSIL in 20 patients led to a highly significant decrease in viral\n      load. We intend to investigate the effect and tolerability of iSIL in HIV-HCV co-infected\n      individuals with advanced liver fibrosis and previous non- or partial response to SOC. All\n      included study-subjects will receive a lead-in therapy with iSIL in a dosage of 20mg/kg/day\n      (expressed as silibinin concentration) once a day for 14 days. At the end of the THISTLE\n      study, i.e. after the day of completion of the 14-day iSIL administration (day 15), the\n      patients will be considered for eligibility to receive standard of care. We assume that the\n      decline in HCV viral load would substantially improve the chances of SVR as the reduction of\n      viral load should both increase the efficacy of PR and reduce the odds of drug resistance to\n      HCV-specific protease inhibitor.\n\n        -  Trial with medicinal product"
