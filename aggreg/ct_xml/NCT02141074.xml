          -  Male, age below 6 years at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Patients with the diagnosis of haemophilia B (FIX (coagulation factor IX) activity
             level below or equal to 2%) based on medical records or central laboratory results

          -  Previously untreated or exposed to FIX containing products less than or equal to 3
             exposure days (5 previous exposures to blood components is acceptable)
