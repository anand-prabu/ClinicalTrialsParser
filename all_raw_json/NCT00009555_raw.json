The mechanisms of abdominal fat accumulation in HIV-infected\n      patients are not known. Studies have shown: treatment with testosterone gel reduces total\n      body fat in young, androgen-deficient men; testosterone replacement in middle-aged men with\n      mid-segment obesity decreases visceral fat; and replacement doses of testosterone decrease\n      fat mass and augment lean body mass in HIV-infected men with androgen deficiency. Therefore,\n      there is a strong rationale for evaluating the effectiveness of testosterone replacement in\n      HIV-infected men with visceral obesity and low testosterone levels.\n\n      Patients are stratified based on their viral load. Patients receive either testosterone gel\n      or placebo applied to the skin once daily for 24 weeks.  Patients remain on their current\n      antiretroviral regimens, which are not supplied through the study.  Patients who receive\n      testosterone during the first 24 weeks are eligible to receive it for an additional 24\n      weeks. Patients on placebo are followed for an additional 24 weeks. Clinical and laboratory\n      evaluations for visceral fat changes are performed throughout the study."

Patients on treatment for at least 12 weeks\n             will be allowed.\n\n          -  Have 5-7 loose stools per day or diarrhea for more than 1 week, within 6 weeks of\n             study entry.\n\n          -  Have a blood pressure greater than 160 over 100.\n\n          -  Have certain heart problems.\n\n          -  Have a breast mass that has not been diagnosed.\n\n          -  Have active cancer.\n\n          -  Have had prostate cancer or certain other prostate problems.\n\n          -  Are allergic to any part of the testosterone gel.\n\n          -  Have a history of blood clots.\n\n          -  Have a history of sleep apnea.\n\n          -  Are receiving experimental treatment.\n\n          -  Are receiving experimental drugs in other studies and do not know if they are taking\n             the drug or placebo.\n\n          -  Abuse drugs or alcohol in a way that would interfere with the study.\n\n          -  Are dieting or doing heavy exercising.\n\n          -  Have a viral load of 10,000 copies/ml or more at screening"
