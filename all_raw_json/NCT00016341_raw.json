Estrogen can stimulate the growth of tumor cells. Hormone\n      therapy using tamoxifen and megestrol may fight endometrial cancer by blocking the\n      absorption of estrogen. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective than\n      hormone therapy in treating endometrial cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with that of hormone therapy in treating patients who have recurrent, stage III, or stage IV\n      endometrial cancer."

Patients are stratified\n      according to progesterone receptor status (negative vs positive). Patients are randomized to\n      1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I:Patients receive chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin IV over 15-30 minutes\n           followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1; paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 2; and\n           filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 3 and continuing for 10 days.\n           Chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  At time of disease progression, patients cross-over to hormonal therapy as in arm II.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive hormonal therapy comprising oral megestrol twice daily on\n           weeks 1-3 followed by oral tamoxifen twice daily on weeks 4-6. Hormonal therapy repeats\n           every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      At time of disease progression, if patients have not previously been enrolled on arm I,\n      patients cross-over to receive chemotherapy as in arm I.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, time of progression, and then after 6\n      weeks on cross-over therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 630 patients will be accrued for this study within 42\n      months."
