Residing in two\n      study areas in Shenyang, China, the women are married, 20 and 34 years of age, never\n      smokers, have obtained permission to have a child, and have attempted to become pregnant\n      over the course of the study.  Lead exposure is defined by lead levels in blood samples\n      collected at the baseline survey (both women and their husbands), first and second\n      trimesters, and at delivery (both maternal and cord blood).  Endocrine dysfunction is\n      monitored by urinary hormone metabolites including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),\n      luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone conjugates (E1C), and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG).\n      Reproductive endpoints  include menstrual disturbance, time to conception, spontaneous\n      abortion, preterm delivery, and low birth weight."
