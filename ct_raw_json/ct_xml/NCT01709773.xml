  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot cohort study of women undergoing focal treatment for high-grade
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HGCIN).  The cohort will be recruited from the UCSF
      Dysplasia Clinics.  The standard treatment involves treatment of the entire cervix.  Women
      with HGCIN meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited for enrollment into the pilot study
      of focal treatment.  Upon enrollment, they will undergo focal treatment rather than standard
      treatment of the cervix.  Follow-up visits will be conducted at 2 weeks and 6 months to
      assess safety, feasibility, and acceptability.  The 6-month recurrence rate of HGCIN will be
      calculated.
