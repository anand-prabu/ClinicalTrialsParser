            "textblock": "Esophageal varices are the most important portosystemic collaterals owing to their rupture\n      results in variceal hemorrhage, which is a devastating event of portal hypertension.\n      Cirrhotic patients surviving a first episode of variceal rupture have a risk of over 60% of\n      suffering from recurrent bleeding within 1 year and mortality from each rebleeding episode\n      is about 20%. Except for patients with a terminal illness, the secondary preventive measures\n      are required to reduce variceal rebleeding to improve patient survival and clinical outcome.\n       Endoscopic and pharmacological therapies are 2 main methods of intervention used to achieve\n      the treatment goals. Endoscopic therapy contains endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) or\n      endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL), which would obliterate varices by causing thrombosis and\n      fibrosis formation. However, EVL has currently replaced EIS as the endoscopic therapy of\n      choice because it is safer, more effective, and has lower morbidity rate.\n\n      Many experts and scholars suggest to repeat EVL every 1-2 weeks until obliteration of\n      esophageal varices to prevent variceal rebleeding, whereas, there are insufficient data to\n      support the concept that EVL at intervals of 1-2 week is appropriate. Our previous studies\n      demonstrated that repeating EVL every 3-4 weeks could achieve an appreciable low incidence\n      of variceal rebleeding and mortality. In our own opinion, many shallow post-EVL ulcers may\n      hamper the performance of variceal ligation if EVL is performed at intervals of 1-2 weeks. A\n      randomized controlled trial from Japan showed that EVL performed at a bimonthly interval\n      obtained a higher variceal obliteration rate, lower variceal recurrence rate and fewer\n      additional treatments. Bimonthly EVL in the secondary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage may\n      be theoretically improper because post-EVL variceal rebleeding could only be significantly\n      reduced in whom variceal obliteration was achieved within a short treatment course. The\n      other retrospective investigation from the United States demonstrated the principal\n      technical aspects of EVL in the prevention of variceal rebleeding, suggesting the benefit of\n      intersession intervals > 3 weeks compared with intervals < 3 weeks.\n\n      This randomized controlled study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness and safety of\n      EVL with two different intersession intervals (bimonthly vs. biweekly). In addition, the\n      risk factors that were associated with variceal rebleeding and mortality were analyzed."
