Dysbiosis, over nutrition, life\n      style, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome are main causes in the disease\n      progression. Research on the role of gut-liver axis in the pathogenesis of NAFLD has been\n      slowly accumulating over the past few years. Endotoxemia resulting from intestinal bacterial\n      overgrowth may contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. So, intestinal microbiota (IM) serve\n      as a potential therapeutic target in NASH. In this regard, we have aimed to test the\n      efficacy of rifaximin against simple steatosis (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) subjects\n      in relation to serum endotoxins and related pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. We hypothesis\n      that Rifaximin treatment may influence the endotoxin levels by modulating gut microbiota and\n      partial alleviate from NAFLD/NASH."
