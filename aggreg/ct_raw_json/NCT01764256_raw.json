If female and of childbearing potential, be not breastfeeding and not pregnant\n                  (based on a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine\n                  pregnancy test during the 24 hours prior to first injection), planning to avoid\n                  pregnancy for at least 4 weeks after the last injection, and willing to use an\n                  adequate method of contraception consistently and have repeated pregnancy tests\n                  prior to second and third injections.\n\n               4. Willing to comply with study restrictions and study schedule (as evidenced by a\n                  signed informed consent form [ICF] and assessment by the PI or designee).\n\n               5.

Have received any vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization or planned\n                  vaccination through Day 84.\n\n              10.

Have received immunosuppressive medications (e.g., prolonged use of systemic\n                  corticosteroid or cytotoxic agent) within the 24 weeks prior to randomization.\n                  Eligible if a short course (\u226410 days) of systemic corticosteroid concluded more\n                  than 2 weeks prior to randomization, use of inhaled corticosteroid for asthma,\n                  and use of topical corticosteroid for a skin condition.\n\n              12. Have a history of any clinically significant (in the opinion of the PI)\n                  immunosuppressive or autoimmune condition.\n\n              13. Anticipate need for administration of any blood product, immunosuppressive\n                  (e.g., systemic corticosteroid), or immunomodulatory treatment during the study.\n\n              14. Have a history of malignancy, excluding basal cell carcinoma.\n\n              15. Have Diabetes Mellitus Type I or II.\n\n              16.

Have abnormal vital signs deemed clinically relevant by the PI.*\n\n              19. Evidence of current or recent (within past 12 months) excessive alcohol\n                  consumption or drug dependence.\n\n              20. Have any condition of hand, arm or related lymph nodes that may confound\n                  post-dose assessments.\n\n              21. Have any condition (medical, psychiatric or behavioral) that, in the opinion of\n                  the PI, would increase the volunteer's health risks in study participation or\n                  would increase the risk of not achieving the study's objectives"
