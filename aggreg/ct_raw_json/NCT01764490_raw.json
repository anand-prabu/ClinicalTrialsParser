The objective is to provide\n           adjusted estimations of their association with outcome variables in comparison with\n           carbapenem monotherapy according to clinical situation and infection.\n\n      Bacteraemic infections due to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae:\n\n        -  To demonstrate that combination therapy is associated with worse cure rate and\n           mortality than monotherapy after controlling for confounders.\n\n        -  To show that carbapenems are associated with worse cure rate and mortality when used in\n           infections other than urinary tract caused by isolates showing MIC <2 \u00b5g/mL for\n           imipenem or meropenem in comparison to those caused by isolates with higher MIC, after\n           controlling for confounders.\n\n        -  To show that colistin used at a dose >6 million IU per day is associated with improved\n           outcomes in comparison with lower dose, after controlling for confounders."

The fact\n           that the case had been previously published should be specified in the database.\n\n        -  Additionally, participants are asked to include consecutive episodes detected by\n           reviewing their databases (clinical, infection control or microbiological records) from\n           January 2004 to June 2012, according to the following criteria:\n\n             -  For ESBL producers:\n\n      A minimum of 20 and a maximum of 50 cases should be included from each centre (the more\n      recent ones should be selected).\n\n        -  Cases for which the enzyme is characterised at least to group level by polymerase chain\n           reaction, PCR, (it is, CTX-M, SHV, TEM) should be prioritised despite the date of\n           diagnosis.\n\n        -  If not enough number of cases with PCR-characterized enzymes are available, or\n           PCR-characterisation has not been performed, the total number of cases should be\n           completed by including cases in which ESBL-production was identified using a standard\n           phenotypic method.\n\n             -  For carbapenemase-producers: only cases in which the carbapenemase was\n                characterised by PCR should be included. All episodes up to a limit of 50 cases\n                per centre may be included.\n\n      Overall, to avoid selection biases, consecutive cases according to previous criteria should\n      be included.\n\n      Variables\n\n      A common online database has been designed. Individual access to the database will be\n      provided.\n\n      Main outcome variable: Cure rate at day 14\n\n      Secondary outcome variables: Mortality at 72 hours, 7, 14 and 30 days, clinical improvement\n      at 72 hours, clinical cure at day 28.\n\n      Explanatory variables:\n\n        -  Demographics\n\n        -  Severity of chronic underlying conditions: McCabe and Charlson index\n\n        -  Acute severity of underlying disease: Pitt score during the the day before BSI.\n\n        -  Type of acquisition\n\n        -  Source of BSI\n\n        -  Severity of SIRS at presentation\n\n        -  Microorganism, betalactamase, MICs\n\n        -  Empirical therapy\n\n        -  Definitive therapy\n\n      Quality of data. Data will be approved and signed by the responsible investigator in each\n      center. All data will be centrally reviewed; queries will be sent for lacking data and those\n      showing inconsistencies or discrepancies. Data will be analysed per center; those with data\n      showing significant differences with the average will be requested for review.\n\n      Statistical Analysis Plan\n\n        -  Subcohorts with patients treated with the treatment to be compared will be selected.\n\n        -  A propensity score to receive the 2 treatment types to compare will be calculated by\n           obtaining a non-parsimonious multivariate model by logistic regression in which the\n           outcome variable will be the treatment type. The explanatory variables will include\n           age, gender, center, type of ward, acquisition, Charlson index, Pitt score, severity of\n           SIRS and source.\n\n        -  After univariate analysis, multivariate analysis to investigate the adjusted\n           association of treatment type with the main and secondary outcome variables will be\n           performed by using logistic regression (for clinical response at day 14) and by Cox\n           regression for mortality. If time until death is unavailable, logistic regression will\n           be used for 30-day mortality. Logistic regression will also be used for 72-hour and\n           30-day clinical response. The propensity score will be added in all cases; also,\n           Charlson score, Pitt score, severity of SIRS and source will be added. Finally,\n           interaction between treatment type and source classified as urinary tract and others\n           will be included."
