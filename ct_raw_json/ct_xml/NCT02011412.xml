  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a risk score composed of age, sex, and the components of
      commonly ordered laboratory panels will be predictive of mortality in trauma patients, and
      will help improve clinicians' ability to make more accurate mortality predictions at the
      time of admission.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient presents to Intermountain Medical Center as a Level I or Level II trauma
             activation.

          -  Age â‰¥18

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not admitted to the hospital

               1. Patients who expire in the Emergency Department

               2. Patients who are discharged to home from the Emergency Department

          -  Patients who do not have a complete blood count and basic metabolic profile drawn in
             the Emergency Department as part of routine clinical care.

          -  Patients who enter the hospital as &quot;trauma consults.&quot; These patients have traumatic
             injuries, and are often admitted to the trauma service, but the severity of their
             trauma is not thought to warrant trauma team activation.
