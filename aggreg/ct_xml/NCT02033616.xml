      This is a double-blind study in which approximately 99 study patients will be randomized in
      a 2:1 ratio to receive either ovapuldencel-T (autologous dendritic cells loaded with
      irradiated autologous tumor cells in GM-CSF) or MC (autologous PBMC in GM-CSF). Patients
      eligible for treatment will be those (1) who have undergone debulking surgery, (2) for whom
      a cell line has been established, (3) who have undergone leukapheresis, (4) are scheduled
      for primary adjuvant chemotherapy, and (5) have an ECOG performance grade of 0 or 1.

      The primary endpoint of this trial is death from any cause with the metric of overall
      survival (OS) from the date of randomization. Progression-free survival (PFS) will be a
      secondary endpoint and will be calculated as the time from the date of randomization for
      treatment until subjective tumor progression or death.  Progression will be subjectively
      defined by the treating physician, and is expected to be based on tumor marker levels (e.g.
      CA-125) and/or imaging. Secondarily, we will also define PFS and OS from the date of
      debulking surgery.

      Patients will be stratified into (1) platinum-resistant, based on progression during
      adjuvant chemotherapy or detectable disease at the conclusion of adjuvant therapy or (2)
      platinum-sensitive, with no evidence of disease (NED) at the conclusion of adjuvant therapy
      (per elevated blood CA-125 and/or tumor markers and/or detection of disease by physical
      examination or imaging).

      Protocol Title: Phase II, Double-Blind, Randomized, Single Center  Trial Of Ovapuldencel-T
      (Autologous Dendritic Cells Loaded With Irradiated Autologous Tumor Cells In GM-CSF)  vs.
      Autologous Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells In GM-CSF (MC) as a Component of Maintenance
      or Secondary Therapy in Patients with Stage III or IV Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or
      Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma after Debulking Surgery and Adjuvant Chemotherapy

      Study Design: A double-blind, randomized, single center trial.

      Number of Study Centers: 1.

      Study Phase: Phase II.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      • Compare overall survival (OS) from the date of randomization for patients treated with
      ovapuldencel-T (autologous dendritic cells pulsed with autologous irradiated tumor cells in
      GM-CSF) to patients treated with autologous blood mononuclear cells in GM-CSF (MC) control.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Establish safety of repeated administration of ovapuldencel-T.

        -  Compare duration of progression-free survival (PFS) from the date of randomization for
           patients treated with ovapuldencel-T to patients treated with MC.

        -  In the subset of platinum-sensitive patients with no evidence of disease (NED) after
           post-debulking chemotherapy, compare OS and PFS from date of randomization

        -  In the subset of platinum-resistant patients, compare OS and PFS from date of
           randomization.

        -  Compare OS and PFS from the date of randomization in patients who have achieved optimal
           tumor debulking to patients whose tumor debulking was suboptimal.  Optimal tumor
           debulking is defined as patients with residual tumor nodules less than or equal to 1 cm
           in diameter.

        -  Compare OS and PFS from date of diagnosis and date of debulking surgery in patients
           treated with ovapuldencel-T to patients treated with MC.

        -  Determine how many, if any, patients have to stop ASI treatment because of reactions
           attributed to the treatment to GM-CSF.

      Study Treatments:

        -  Ovapuldencel-T: Autologous dendritic cells loaded with antigens from irradiated
           autologous tumor cells and suspended in GM-CSF.

        -  MC: Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells suspended in GM-CSF will serve as the
           control arm.

      Patient Population: Female subjects 18 years or older with newly diagnosed stage III or IV
      ovarian cancer, who are candidates for surgical debulking and receipt of chemotherapy.
      Performance status must be an ECOG score of 0 or 1at the time of enrollment for ASI
      treatment.

      maintenance or secondary therapy is given), for up to a total of eight doses of ASI
      treatment given over four to six months.

      Dosage: Each dose of ovapuldencel-T or MC contains approximately 5-10 million cells. Each
      dose is suspended in 500 mcg GM-CSF prior to administration.

      Mode of Administration: Subcutaneous (SC) injections.

      Study Endpoints:

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

      • Overall Survival (OS): time to death from date of randomization.

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

        -  The success rate for establishing a tumor cell line.

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS): time to disease progression or death from date of
           randomization.

        -  OS and PFS for the subset of patients who are platinum-sensitive after adjuvant
           therapy.

        -  OS and PFS for the subset of patients who are platinum-resistant after/during primary
           adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  OS and PFS from dates of initial diagnosis and debulking surgery.

      Safety Endpoints:

        -  Adverse events attributed to the cell therapy (including GM-CSF) and not attributed to
           chemotherapy to assess safety and tolerability.

        -  Abnormal findings by history &amp; physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory
           tests (safety), and other tests as clinically indicated, that might be attributed to
           the cell therapy.

      Study Duration and Follow-Up: All patients who qualify for participation in the study will
      be followed for up to 5 years from date of randomization or until death, whichever occurs
      first.

      Statistical Methods:

      Null-Hypotheses: [1] For all patients, OS is no different for patients who receive
      ovapuldencel-T compared to patients who receive MC [2] For platinum-sensitive patients, OS
      is no different for patients who receive ovapuldencel-T compared to patients who receive MC,
      [3] For patients who are platinum-resistant, OS is no different for patients who receive
      ovapuldencel-T compared to patients who receive MC.

      Analyses:  Kaplan-Meier curves will display survival times for each treatment group. The log
      rank test will be used to analyze OS to test the null hypothesis of no treatment difference.
       The Cox regression model and the Wald test will be used to estimate the hazard ratio
      associated with treatment and to identify the significance of potential prognostic factors
      and their impact, if any on the treatment differences. Analyses based on the intention to
      treat population will be considered as the primary analysis, analyses based on the
      Per-Protocol population will be considered as a sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analyses of
      the OS endpoint will mimic the plan laid out for the primary endpoint for platinum-resistant
      patients and platinum-sensitive patients separately.
