Subjects will be monitored and assessed for adverse\n      events post-dose. Subjects will be sent home and asked to return in 24 hours. 24 hours\n      post-dose, two vaginal and two cervical biopsies will be obtained. These biopsies will then\n      be placed in an ex-vivo culture system and exposed to HIV. Viral RNA will be measured over\n      two days to determine whether the tissues were protected from infection. A final visit for\n      safety will be conducted 7-14 days post-enrollment."
