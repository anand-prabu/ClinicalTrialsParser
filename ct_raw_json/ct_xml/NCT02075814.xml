    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. This includes worsening (eg, increase in frequency or severity) of pre-existing conditions. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations. Refer to the General Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants who developed an anti-raxibacumab antibody response</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Number of participants who developed an anti-raxibacumab antibody response during the study were assessed. .Immunogenicity testing was performed to determine if raxibacumab induced an anti-raxibacumab immune response. Testing comprised of 2 assays (screening and confirmatory). The screening assay (direct binding) was an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging assay. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was used as a positive control. Samples above the assay cut point were considered positive. Samples identified as positive in the screening assay were confirmed positive in a confirmatory assay. Samples must have demonstrated a significant percent drop in the confirmatory inhibition of binding assay to be considered positive. The inhibition of binding confirmatory assay was performed identically to the direct binding screening assay with the exception that the samples were tested in parallel with excess unlabeled raxibacumab.</description>

    <measure>Mean raxibacumab concentration-time following a single IV infusion dose</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Blood was collected from each participant at selected times post dose, and serum specimens were analyzed for raxibacumab using a validated electrochemiluminescense-based assay.  The individual serum raxibacumab concentration data were summarized by nominal collection time and treatment group using descriptive statistics. Blood samples for serum raxibacumab concentration measurement were collected from participants who received a single-dose prior to administration of the raxibacumab and diphenhydramine doses on Day 0, at 30 minutes and 2 to 6 hours after completion of the raxibacumab infusion, and at 14, 28, and 56 days after the raxibacumab dose.</description>
