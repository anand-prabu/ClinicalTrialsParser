Following the loading dose period, OGX-427 will be administered at 600mg IV weekly Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21 day cycle during the Treatment Phase. OGX-427 will be given prior to the administration of pemetrexed (500mg/m2 IV) and carboplatin (AUC 6 IV) on Day 1 of each cycle.  A maximum of four treatment cycles will be administered.
Patients with objective response or stable disease after four cycles of therapy will move on to a Maintenance Phase of OGX-427 administered at 600mg IV weekly Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21 day cycle plus pemetrexed (500mg/m2 IV on Day 1).  Patients may remain on maintenance as long as they are benefiting and have no evidence of disease progression.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of advanced NSCLC, excluding squamous cell and
             small cell histology.  Tumors with mixed NSCLC histologies are eligible, as long as
             the predominant histology is not squamous.  If small-cell elements are present or not
             otherwise specified histologically, the patient is not eligible.

          2. Recurrent or Stage IV disease (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
             staging system, v7.0).

          3. No prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or biological
             therapy; adjuvant therapy is allowed as long as the interval from end of adjuvant
             therapy until disease progression was &gt;12 months.

          4. No prior radiation therapy to the whole pelvis or to ≥25% of the total bone marrow
             area.  Radiation therapy must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.
             Must have recovered from acute adverse effects prior to randomization.

          5. At least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score of 0 or 1.

          7. Baseline laboratory values as follows:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥10 g/dL

               -  Platelets ≥100,000/μL

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ≤3.0 x the
                  upper limit of normal (ULN); 5 x ULN if known hepatic metastases.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, unless secondary to Gilbert's disease

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN.  If creatinine is &gt;1.5, calculate creatinine
                  clearance (CrCl) ≥45 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault method:

             Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) = (140-age) x (weight/kg) x (0.85 if female) (72 x
             serum creatinine mg/dL)

          8. Fertile male patients willing to use adequate contraceptive measures.

          9. Female patients who are not of child-bearing potential, and fertile female patients
             of child-bearing potential who agree to use adequate contraceptive measures, who are
             not breastfeeding, and who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72
             hours prior to start of randomization.

         10. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

         11. Must be ≥18 years of age at the time of consent.

         12. Willingness and ability to comply with trial and follow-up procedures.

          1. Known anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation and epidermal growth factor
             receptor (EGFR) &quot;activating&quot; mutations where first-line treatment with targeted
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is more appropriate.

          2. Known central nervous system (CNS) disease other than neurologically stable, treated
             brain metastases - defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression or
             hemorrhage after treatment and no ongoing requirements for corticosteroids, (e.g.,
             dexamethasone) for at least 2 weeks.

          3. Any of the following cardiac diseases currently or within the last 6 months as
             defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) ≥ Class 2:

                  rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the absence of other cardiac
                  abnormalities are eligible).

          4. Patients currently receiving therapeutic anticoagulation.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women.

          6. Any serious, active underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the
             patient to receive study treatment, such as diabetes mellitus or infection.

          7. Unable or unwilling to take folic acid or vitamin B12.

          8. Active second malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin or superficial bladder cancer)
             defined as requiring current need for cancer therapy or at high risk of recurrence
             (&gt;350%) during the study.

          9. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.

         10. Inability or unwillingness to comply with trial and/or follow-up procedures outlined
