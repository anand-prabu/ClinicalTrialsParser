      This study is being done to understand the effects of dietary omega-3 fats on insulin
      sensitivity in adult men and women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), which include eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from fish oil, prevent insulin resistance in rodents,
      but data in humans is ambiguous.  No existing studies have systematically evaluated the
      influence of n-3 PUFAs on insulin sensitivity and beta cell function in insulin resistant,
      non-diabetic humans.  The Investigators hypothesize that 6 months of oral supplementation of
      purified EPA/DHA (3.9g/day) will significantly improve hepatic and peripheral insulin
      sensitivity and beta cell responsiveness in insulin-resistant, non-diabetic individuals.
      Based on recent work in mice, the investigators also hypothesize that EPA/DHA will increase
      the content and function of mitochondria in skeletal muscle, measured using a combination of
      in vivo and in vitro methods. Overall, the investigators hypothesize that EPA+DHA
      supplementation will improve hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant
      humans, and this improvement will be associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and attenuated
      lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and liver.
