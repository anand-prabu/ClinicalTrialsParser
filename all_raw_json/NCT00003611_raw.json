The use of acitretin may be an effective way to prevent\n      the recurrence or further development of skin cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of acitretin in preventing\n      skin cancers in patients with at least two previously treated skin cancers who have\n      undergone organ transplantation."

Patients are stratified according to age (at least 18\n      to under 50 vs 50 to 59 vs 60 to 69 vs 70 and over), number of prior skin cancers in past 5\n      years (2 vs 3 vs at least 4), time since most recent skin cancer occurrence (less than 12\n      months vs at least 12 months), sunburn susceptibility (none vs moderate vs high), visible\n      skin damage (mild vs moderate vs severe).\n\n      Patients receive either oral acitretin or placebo daily for 2 years. Skin biopsies are\n      obtained at 1 year from normal areas and from any areas with skin cancer for genetic\n      studies.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years."
