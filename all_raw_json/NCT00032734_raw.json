The participation in the study lasts up to 34 days.  After screening,\n      during the first part of the study (maximum 5 days), the subjects receive either capsules of\n      SR121463B or a matching placebo.  During the second part of the study (23 days), subjects\n      receive either capsules of SR121463B or no treatment.  The subjects will be assessed by\n      physical examinations, electrocardiograms, blood samplings, and urine collections. Women of\n      childbearing potential must have an approved method of contraception."
