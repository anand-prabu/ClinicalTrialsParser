In the last update it has become evident\n      the need of modifications to adapt the program to modern times and focuses on improving\n      accessibility and offering more flexible responses to users of the program. In this sense,\n      the mobile phone technology could be useful, specifically the messaging service to remind\n      patients their appointments and increase attendance rates. Main objective Compare the\n      percentage of patients in the intervention group compared with the control group who\n      achieved a figure of HbA1c <7% in 2013.Design: single blind Randomized Clinical Trial. Study\n      population: Patients with diabetes with or without hypertension or lipid metabolism\n      disorder, over 18 years, belonging to the Public Health System of Basque Country (primary\n      care) meeting the inclusion / exclusion criteria. Sample size: 232 patients (116 per arm) to\n      detect a difference in the percentage of patients with HbA1c lower than 7% between groups:\n      Short Messages Standard (SMS) group: Mobile messages reminding the next review of Papps.\n      Control group: Routine clinical practice. Statistical analysis: The relationship between the\n      intervention received and the main variable (compliance with preventive activities at 12\n      months) were analyzed using a logistic regression model."
