            "textblock": "Removal of the bladder and adjacent organs in patients with bladder cancer (radical\n      cystectomy) often results in significant blood loss, and approximately 60% of patients\n      require peri-operative blood transfusion. Reducing blood loss and the frequency of\n      transfusion offers several benefits, including donor blood conservation, health care cost\n      reduction, and avoidance of blood product exposure. Tranexamic acid is an amino acid lysine\n      derivative with strong antifibrinolytic clotting properties that can be administered\n      systemically. This medication has been used in a variety of operative procedures, notably in\n      high risk cardiac surgery, to decrease peri-operative blood loss, and it is associated with\n      an acceptable risk of adverse events. Systemic anti-hemorrhagics are infrequently used\n      during radical cystectomy, and to the investigators knowledge their effects have not been\n      evaluated in a clinical trial.\n\n      Overall objective: To conduct an internal pilot study to determine feasibility of a\n      randomized controlled trial of systemic tranexamic acid compared to placebo in reducing the\n      number of blood transfusions in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.\n\n      Design: An internal pilot study, employing the protocol of the full multi-center,\n      randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial.\n\n      Study population: Consenting patients 18 years of age and older undergoing a radical\n      cystectomy for bladder cancer, excluding those who: are unwilling to receive blood products\n      due to personal reasons, are pregnant, have active angina, have a known allergy to\n      tranexamic acid, or have a known personal history of deep venous thrombosis, atrial\n      fibrillation, coronary stent, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, thrombotic\n      stroke and / or acquired disturbance of colour vision. The pilot study will recruit the\n      first 55 patients of 354 patients required for the full study from Dalhousie University,\n      McGill University, Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Universit\u00e9 Laval, University of Ottawa,\n      University of Western Ontario and University of Alberta.\n\n      Intervention:\n\n      Tranexamic Acid arm: Tranexamic acid will be administered as an intravenous infusion of 10\n      mg/kg over 10 minutes (loading dose) before surgical incision, followed by 5 mg/kg/hour\n      continuous maintenance infusion for the length of surgery (typically 4 to 8 hours). For\n      example, an 80 kg patient would receive 800 mg prior to incision and a 400 mg/hour infusion\n      for the duration of surgery. For a 6 hour procedure, the total dose administered would be\n      3200 mg.\n\n      Placebo arm: As there is no standard of care concerning administration of antifibrinolytic\n      agents in cystectomy procedures, controls will follow the same dosing and schedule described\n      above, but with 0.9% saline infusion.\n\n      Outcomes: The principal research questions for the investigators internal pilot (current\n      application) pertain to feasibility of enrollment of cystectomy patients using the full RCT\n      protocol of tranexamic acid vs. placebo. The pilot will address feasibility of site-specific\n      enrollment, feasibility of multiple site start-ups, and feasibility of institutional ethics\n      approval, protocol administration, and multicenter coordination.\n\n      The primary research objective for the investigators full RCT is whether the use of systemic\n      tranexamic acid compared to placebo reduces the proportion of radical cystectomy patients\n      requiring red blood cell transfusion up to 30 days post-operative (from a 50% transfusion\n      rate with placebo to 35% with tranexamic acid). Secondary questions for the investigators\n      full trial are: Will use of systemic tranexamic acid compared to placebo result in\n      reductions in: i) intraoperative blood loss, ii) amounts of transfused blood products, and\n      iii) post-operative complications? The safety (thrombotic events) of tranexamic acid will\n      also be evaluated.\n\n      Importance of this study: A successful pilot will encourage us to continue with the full RCT\n      that will determine whether tranexamic acid reduces blood loss and subsequent transfusions\n      during radical cystectomy. If tranexamic acid reduces the number of blood transfusions,\n      there will be an immediate impact to cystectomy patients, and surgeons may consider the\n      routine use of systemic tranexamic acid during similar abdomino-pelvic procedures associated\n      with significant blood loss."
