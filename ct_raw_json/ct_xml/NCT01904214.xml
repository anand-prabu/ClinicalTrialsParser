    <description>The pharmacokineticsof BAF312 will be studied in plasma up to 312 (+/-24) hours post-dose at the following time points: pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 216, and 312 (+/-24) hours post dose. Selected metabolites will also be quantified using the same samples as described above. Free plasma circulating fraction of BAF312 will also be investigated to assess whether protein binding is affected by renal impairment. For this purpose a separate blood sample will be taken at the following time point: 4 hours post-dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects:

          -  At least 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within 18-38 kg/m2.

          -  CYP2C9 wild-type (CYP2C9*1 homozygous carriers)

        Renal impairment:

        - Subjects must have either mild, moderate or severe renal impairment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All subjects

          -  Use of other investigational drugs within certain timelines

          -  Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood or plasma within eight (8) weeks prior to
             initial dosing

          -  History of cardiac rhythm abnormalities or cardiac rhythm abnormalities identified in
             the 24-h Holter ECG recording including episodes of bradycardia (HR &lt; 50 bpm) during
             waking hours and/or arrhythmic episodes; subjects with history or presence of
             ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extra-systoles &gt;100/24h, or higher
             grade), or supraventricular arrhythmias (other than occasional supraventricular
             ectopic beats with a maximum of 5 subsequent ectopic beats per event) or subjects
             with conduction disturbances (higher than AV-block grade 1) or bradycardia or
             tachycardia.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system

          -  History or presence of symptomatic postural hypotension or syncope.

          -  Total WBC or lymphocyte counts which falls outside the 1.5-fold local laboratory
             normal range or platelet count &lt; 30,000/Î¼L at screening or baseline.

             (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result at screening.

        Renal impairment:

          -  History or presence of any non-controlled and clinically significant disease that
             could affect the study outcome or that would place the patient at undue risk.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition other than renal impairment which might
             significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs,
             or which may jeopardize the safety of the study subject in case of participation in
             the study.

          -  Treatment with certain drugs

        Healthy subjects:

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant disease of any major system organ
             class including (but not limited to) cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, neurological
             or psychiatric diseases.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, drugs, or which may jeopardize the
