      This study wants to prove that Yoga Training can improve physical Fitness, immunity, and
      quality of Life of in Breast Cancer Survivors. In summary, our findings show potential
      benefits of yoga for people with cancer in improvements of psychological health. Because of
      the small number of studies having been conducted and the methodological limitations, the
      results should be regarded as preliminary and treated with caution. Our preliminary findings
      also provide practitioners with important information that yoga may be a possible adjunctive
      therapy for cancer patients to help manage psychological distress and to improve quality of
      life.
