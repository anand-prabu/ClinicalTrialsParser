This study examines whether these drug\n      combinations are effective in preventing kidney disease from progressing to a stage where it\n      is immediately life threatening. This study also examines the effect these drug combinations\n      have on the level of HIV detected in these patients. Finally, this study evaluates the drug\n      level (the amount of drug found in the body) of these two combinations in patients with\n      kidney disease."
