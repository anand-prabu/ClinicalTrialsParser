The study is\n      divided in two parts. Part 1 is a single-ascending dose (SAD) study which will include up to\n      10 panels (using ascending doses starting from 0.1 mg) in which a single dose of the study\n      medication will be administered on Day 1. Part 2 is a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study\n      which will include approximately 6 panels (using ascending doses starting from 5.0 mg) in\n      which multiple doses of study medication will be administered once daily for 10 days.\n\n      Part 2 will be initiated after completion of dosing and all relevant evaluations from Part\n      1. In each panel of Part 1 and 2, 6 participants will be randomly assigned to receive\n      JNJ-42721458 and 2 participants randomly assigned to placebo. Safety evaluations will\n      include assessment of adverse events, physical examinations, laboratory tests, vital signs,\n      electrocardiograms, cardiac telemetry and evaluation of injection sites which will be\n      monitored throughout the study. The total study duration for each participant will be\n      approximately 6-7 weeks in Part 1 and 7-8 weeks for each participant in Part 2."
