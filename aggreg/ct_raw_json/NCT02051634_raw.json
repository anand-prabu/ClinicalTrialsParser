The investigators will conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot\n      study on FPP in older adults. If FPP is found to have a beneficial impact on systematic\n      inflammation in this study population (adults aged 70-100 years old), then this supplement\n      may be a potential treatment option to combat aging."

Visit 1 will take place approximately 30 days after the Screening Visit. Visit\n      2 will take place approximately 8 weeks after the Screening Visit. Visit 3 will take place\n      approximately 16 weeks after the Screening Visit. Visit 4 will take place approximately 20\n      weeks after the Screening Visit. Participants will be asked to fast (i.e., no food or\n      liquids except water) for 8 hours prior to all clinic visits. Each visit will take\n      approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\n      Participants will also be called weekly during the study to ask how they are feel and to\n      find out and if they remembered to take all of their study supplement. Finally,\n      investigators will call approximately two weeks after participants stop taking the study\n      supplement to ask how they are feeling."
