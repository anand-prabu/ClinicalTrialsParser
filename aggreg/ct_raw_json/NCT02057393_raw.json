            "textblock": "The initial treatment for most people with melanoma involves wide excision of the skin and\n      sentinel node biopsy. As with other cancers, the status of the sentinel node provides\n      important prognostic information to the patient and physician. Sentinel node biopsy was\n      first developed using only a blue dye. Technetium99, a radioactive protein, was added later\n      and provides the ability to image the patient and identify relevant lymph node basins. For\n      the last 15 years or so, the standard method of SLN localization includes both tech99 and\n      blue dye. While the rates of localization overall are excellent, these methods each have\n      drawbacks. We are investigating a new method of finding sentinel nodes that uses a green dye\n      that has an infrared signal. Our hypothesis is that indocyanine green (ICG) and real time\n      lymphangiography is equivalent to technetium99 and methylene blue in identifying sentinel\n      nodes (SLN) in patients with melanoma."
