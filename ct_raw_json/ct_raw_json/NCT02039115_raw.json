Barretts segment \u2265 30% circumference, \u2264C3 and \u2264M5.\n\n          3. The general health condition of the patient permits anesthesia for endoscopy.\n\n          4. Patient is 18 years of age or older.\n\n          5. Informed consent is obtained\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Previous (referral) biopsies show low grade dysplasia only, or invasive\n             adenocarcinoma.\n\n          2. Barretts segment <30% circumference, >C3 or >M5.\n\n          3. During initial gastroscopy there are highly suspicious areas for submucosal invasive\n             cancer (Kudo pit pattern type V; excavated/depressed type morphology; large smooth or\n             ulcerated nodule). In cases of significant doubt, initial resection is of the highly\n             suspicious area only, and urgent histology processing requested. If submucosal\n             invasion is excluded, the patient is rebooked for 1st stage CBE (60% circumferential\n             resection) and randomization after a 4-6 weeks interval.\n\n          4. Presence of a tight peptic oesophageal stricture that impedes safe and effective EMR\n             using the DuetteTM cap (Cook Medical).\n\n          5. Active malignancy, uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus, active or untreated major\n             psychiatric disorder, uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled\n             or severe congestive cardiac failure, non-correctable coagulopathy (INR>2, or\n             platelet count <60 x 109/L), osteoporosis, recent peptic ulcer disease,\n             moderate-to-severe glaucoma or untreated glaucoma, or pregnancy.\n\n          6.
