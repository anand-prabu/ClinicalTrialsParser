A few studies have suggested\n      the role of infection in the gastrointestinal tract in the etiology and pathogenesis of\n      neurological diseases such as idiopathic Parkinson. For example, infection with Helicobacter\n      pylori has been suggested to play a role in Parkinson disease. In addition, bacterial\n      pathogens such as spirochetes and bacterial products such as cyanobacterial toxins have been\n      speculated as the contributing factors in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n      (ALS).  The effect of microbial composition of the gut in the pathogenesis of ALS is\n      suspected. The difference in the bacterial profile of the gut has been documented in\n      diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and obesity.\n\n      The goal of this IRB protocol is to create a human tissue bank and to obtain patients'\n      demographic information for future investigation of the role of bacterial pathogens and the\n      role of gut flora composition in the development of neurodegenerative diseases including but\n      not limited to ALS, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis."
