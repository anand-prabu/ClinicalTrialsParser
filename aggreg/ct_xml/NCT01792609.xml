      Objectives Primary objective:  Determine if there is a clinically significant difference in
      percent Cobb curve correction in a low- vs. high-implant density cohort through a
      prospective randomized controlled trial.

      Design and Outcomes Randomized clinical trial of equivalence to test the efficacy and safety
      of low vs. high implant density instrumentation for spine deformity surgery in AIS patients
      with Lenke IA curve patterns.

      Interventions and Duration Intervention:  low-implant density group or high-implant density
      group. Duration:  2 years. Sample Size and Population Target population: 10 to 17 years old
      with AIS who will undergo instrumented spinal fusion.  Sample size needed (power = 90%) is
      174 subjects with 87 in each group.

    <textblock>
      The MIMO Study Group proposes to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial in order
      to determine whether a low implant density cohort has equivalent clinical and radiographic
      results to a high implant density cohort.  This study is proposed as a trial of equivalence.
       The null hypothesis is that significant differences exist in percent major Cobb angle
      correction between high- and low-implant density cohorts for Lenke 1A curve types, the most
      common scoliotic curve pattern (73).  Consecutive qualifying patients will be screened and
      enrolled by high-volume spine surgeons at 14 sites and randomized to spinal instrumentation
      with a low- or high-density screw pattern.  Patients will return at 3-months, 1-year, and
      2-years for exam, radiographs, and collection of patient-reported outcome scores.  The Harms
      Study Group Foundation will serve as a collaborating organization and will provide database
      development and management, secure online data collection, centralized radiographic
      measurements, and data quality control.  The University of Minnesota team will lead study
      design, protocol development, IRB/data use agreement contracts, patient randomization, and
      statistical analysis, including quarterly data review.  Imaging will be obtained either with
      an EOS system or using a calibration belt during the radiographs, which allows for
      subsequent with the 3D modeling of the deformity.  Six enrolling sites currently have this
      capability (EOS - Montreal, St. Louis, Iowa, Mayo, DuPont, and San Diego).  An additional
      five sites already have calibration belts - Dallas, New York, Baltimore, Boston, U. of
      Rochester), and new calibration belts will be fabricated for the additional sites.  The
      Montreal site will supervise collection of radiographic data with 3D capability and assist
      with troubleshooting and radiographic quality control.  Although the study is primarily
      powered to detect change in percent correction of the major coronal curve, preliminary data
      will be gathered on axial and sagittal plane correction as well as complications, surgical
      factors, and patient-reported outcomes.

    <description>Radiographic, surgical, and patient-reported data will be gathered and analyzed to observe changes between time points.  All radiographs will be taken with 3D analysis capability, either with a calibration belt using standard radiograph techniques or with an EOS imaging system.  This will allow for additional detailed correction measures, such as change in spinal rotation (orientation of the planes of maximum curvature) and detailed coronal, sagittal and transverse plane measures.  Bending films will be taken according to institutional protocol.  The SRS-30, SAQ, and EQ5D will be collected at all clinical visits.  Study questions will be aligned as much as possible with other prospective scoliosis protocols so as to minimize patient and surgeon response burden.  The study protocol requires no additional visits or radiographs beyond standard of care.</description>
