The SCOR and its subproject were awarded in December, 1991. Dollars\n      were estimated at 20 percent of total center dollars.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Data from a previous study of PPHN were analyzed.  The objectives were to: identify the\n      effects of a variety of potentially adverse prenatal exposures from interview data;\n      formulate multi-variate models of risk of PPHN to determine if smoking or use of\n      prostaglandin inhibitors increased the risk of PPHN; explore associations of PPHN with\n      history of illicit drug use and maternal hypoxia; examine the relationships of postnatal\n      care and perinatal risk factors on the incidence and outcome of PPHN; test the relationships\n      of PPHN to the biochemical presence of nicotine and drugs in neonatal urine."
