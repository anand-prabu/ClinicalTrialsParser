      The purposes of this pilot research study are 1. To begin to test if two different types of
      physical therapy might have different results in children and adolescents who have had a
      prior stroke, and 2. To determine if either type of physical therapy causes changes in the
      brain signals that control leg muscles. All participants will receive physical therapy 3
      times per week for 8 weeks. Half of the participants will receive typical physical therapy,
      such as walking practice, muscle strengthening, and balance training. Half of the
      participants will receive asymmetrical gait training physical therapy, which uses new
      technology to train each leg differently during walking practice. After enrolling,
      participants will be randomly assigned to the type of therapy. Measurements will be taken
      before, during, and after the 8 weeks of physical therapy. These include walking tests to
      measure symmetry, walking speed and daily step activity, and brain tests to measure the
      strength of the signals from the brain to the leg muscles. One blood test is also taken to
      identify if certain genetic factors affect how each child responds to the physical therapy.

      Effective rehabilitation after acquired brain injury is essential for reducing the impact of
      the leading cause of pediatric disability in the United States. Neuroplastic changes in
      response to physical therapy are likely different in children compared to adults because
      children are continuing to experience developmental brain maturation while also experiencing
      the neural changes associated with injury and rehabilitation. The interaction between these
      two processes is poorly understood but presumably critical for maximizing long term
      outcomes. Using biomarkers to measure and predict rehabilitation-induced changes will
      improve rehabilitation prognosis and will facilitate the development of rehabilitation
      interventions that optimize neuroplastic potential in children. The objectives of this pilot
      study are to investigate the motor and neural responses to two different rehabilitation
      programs in children and adolescents with chronic hemiplegia from prior stroke. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive conventional physical therapy or an asymmetrical gait
      training program. Conventional physical therapy will include activities such as gait and
      balance training and muscle strengthening. The asymmetrical gait training program uses new
      technology to train each leg at a different speed during walking practice. Measurements of
      motor and neural function will occur at five timepoints before, during and after treatment.
      Motor function measures will include gait symmetry ratios, walking speed, community step
      activity, and participant and caregiver ratings on self-identified walking goals. Neural
      measures will include motor response characteristics of muscle contractions elicited in two
      lower extremity muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the injured cortex. We will
      also establish a genetic database to identify the presence or absence of two genetic
      variants [Apolipoprotein E (ApoE Ð„4) and val66met Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF)
      polymorphisms] associated with decreased potential for neuroplasticity for planning future
      investigations. The results will be used to inform the design of larger studies evaluating
      physical therapy treatments that maximize the capacity of the child's brain to change after
      neurological injury and identifying predictors of rehabilitation-induced neuroplasticity in
      children.
