Both\n      algorithms are available in commercially available software.  Both algorithms find an MA for\n      a sample; however, the difference between the two algorithms is the \"acceptance criteria\"\n      which each use for identifying the MA.  As compared to Small Deviation MA, the Absolute MA\n      has a larger and more stringent rules set.\n\n      A study will be run to establish reference intervals following the guidelines set out in\n      CLSI document C28-A3c. This guideline calls for a reference interval to be constructed from\n      at least 120 donors.  To meet the guidance outlined in the CLSI guideline, we will collect a\n      minimum of 146 donors."
