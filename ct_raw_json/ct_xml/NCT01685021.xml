             progression after at least one prior therapy. Patients with
             Philadelphia-chromosome-positive B-ALL can only be included if they are refractory or
             intolerant to at least one tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor.

          -  Male or female patients at least  16 years of age; if the patient is less than 18
             years of age, the patient must have the ability to understand and give written assent

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of B-ALL

          -  Mixed phenotype acute leukemia patients who have B cell immunophenotype.

          -  Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of less than
             or equal to 2

          -  Patients with a total bilirubin of less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Patients with alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase less than or
             equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Patients with a creatinine level of less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL

          -  If a female of childbearing potential, confirmation of a negative pregnancy test
             before enrollment and use of double-barrier contraception, confirmation of a negative
             pregnancy test before enrollment and use of  oral contraceptive plus barrier
             contraceptive, or confirmation of having undergone clinically documented total
             hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or tubal ligation

          -  If a male, use of an effective barrier method of contraception during the study and
             for 3 months after the last dose if sexually active with a female of childbearing
             potential

          -  Patients with the ability to understand and give written informed consent and to
             comply with the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received previous treatment with an anti-CD19 antibody or fragments

          -  Receipt of  anti-CD20 therapy no greater than  4 weeks before the first study dose

          -  Patients having undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation within 3 months
             or having active graft versus host disease

             serology for hepatitis B, defined as positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg)
             or total anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-Hbc). Patients positive for anti- Hbc
             may be included if hepatitis B viral DNA is not detectable. Hepatitis C (HCV):
             Patients with positive hepatitis C serology (defined as positive for anti-hepatitis C
             virus antibody (anti-HCV) unless HCV-RNA is confirmed negative.

          -  Patients with active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection requiring active
             parenteral treatment

          -  Patients who are receiving active treatment/chemotherapy for another primary
             malignancy or have received any treatment, including surgery, radiation, or
             chemotherapy, within the past 5 years (except ductal breast cancer in situ, for
