Its results always showes a\n      lack of knowledge of these methods and the utility to pursue the researches.\n\n      In the department of pediatric surgery of the university hospital of Limoges, the\n      relaxing-touch is one of these methods which is more and more used. The healthcare staff\n      noticed the beneficial effects of such an empirical method in terms of comfort and quality\n      of life for the children.\n\n      In 2011, a pilot study led in this department showed that, in spite of the usual treatment,\n      the removal of the Redon's drain remains painful for 25 % of the children (score on the pain\n      scale > or = 4). This result convinced the medical team to write a protocol of research from\n      the following hypothesis: the implementation of a protocol of the Redon's drain removal\n      associated to the relaxing touch and usual treatment could lead to a decrease of the acute\n      pain for a 7 to 17 years old child."
