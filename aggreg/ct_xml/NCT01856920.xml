    <textblock>
      This study is being done because standard therapies have not been effective in medullary
      thyroid cancer (MTC).  The NIH research team is studying how an experimental vaccine will
      affect MTC.  The vaccine (GI-6207) is made with yeast and designed to target cells making a
      protein called CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen).  The study is testing the safety and
      tolerability of GI-6207.  GI-6207 is made with baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
      The yeast is genetically modified, made to express CEA, then heat killed.  The goal is to
      get the immune system to respond to the vaccine by making immune cells that can recognize
      and attach tumor cells.  Patients will be randomized to GI-6207 or to surveillance for 6
      months followed by treatment with GI-6207.  Patients will receive up to 1 year of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medullary thyroid cancers are CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) expressing tumors.  Indolent
      disease course may allow necessary time to generate an immune response.  There are no
      standard treatments for patient with asymptomatic metastatic disease.  GI-6207 can induce
      specific T cell responses against the CEA antigen.  Previous data suggests that therapeutic
      cancer vaccines can alter tumor growth rates and do so within 6 months.  An analysis of
      medullary thyroid cancer patients suggest that 6 months of surveillance is adequate to
      calculate a growth rate in the control arm.  A comparison of growth rates after 6 months
      will be made between patients treated with GI-6207 and those on surveillance.  For patients
      on surveillance, they will also be compared to their own baseline growth rate after they
      have received 6 months of therapy.
