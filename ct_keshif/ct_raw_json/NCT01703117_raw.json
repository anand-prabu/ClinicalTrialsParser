The\n      paucity of effective treatments for cognitive aging disorders, and most importantly in\n      Alzheimer's disease instigates a need for further research into novel therapeutic\n      possibilities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and its\n      prevalence steeply increases. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in neuropsychiatric\n      disorders and in particular in Alzheimer's disease has been shown to cause significant\n      cerebral damage. Early effective therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is critical\n      in order to prevent or at least retard neuropathological progression that will lead to\n      widespread irreversible neuronal loss and significant cognitive dysfunction. Riluzole, a\n      glutamate modulator agent that is a proven safe medication and has not yet been used in\n      cognitive aging disorders, will be tested in mild Alzheimer's disease patients. Cognitive\n      functional changes along with two established in vivo biomarkers, namely, Magnetic Resonance\n      Spectroscopy (MRS) and Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) will\n      be evaluated."
