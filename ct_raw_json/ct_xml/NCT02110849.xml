      To prospectively collect data from patients treated with proton therapy for prostate cancer
      using the IUHPTC technique for the evaluation of toxicity and efficacy of this treatment
      technique.

      The major purpose of this study is to analyze side effects experienced and self-reported by
      prostate cancer patients undergoing proton radiation therapy at IUHPTC.  With the
      information collected, the investigators will establish pre-existing conditions before
      proton treatment and measure side effects after treatments that are not related to the
      pre-existing conditions.  Also, to compare long-term side effects for patients who are
      treated with hormone suppression therapy along with their proton therapy to those patients
      who do not get treated with hormone suppression therapy.  This information will help doctors
      better understand the side effects experienced and may help provide valuable information for
      future patients making decisions regarding their treatment options.

      Finally, to develop a database of information regarding the treatment and outcomes for
      patients with prostate cancer in order to improve care of patients with this type of cancer.

    <description>A collection of toxicity events of proton therapy, evaluate the long-term side effects of hormone suppression vs. non-hormone suppression and documents the clinical benefits this therapy in regards to urinary, sexual and gastrointestinal issues.
To do this the investigators will use the following standard of care data collection forms that include; the International Index of Erectile Function (Attachment 1), the American Urological Association Symptom Index (Attachment 2) and the Radiation Therapy Initial Nursing Assessment (Attachment 3), The prostate preexisting conditions review (attachment 4) and the prostate side effects review (attachment 5).  Other clinical data such us demographics, vitals, previous treatments, PSA(prostate specific antigen/Hormone results, follow up data, as described in the protocol schedule of events, will be collected as per routine standard of care.</description>

             prostate and are scheduled to receive proton radiation treatment at IUHPTC.

          -  Subjects with any stage or grade of tumor will be allowed including proton salvage
             therapy in the context of a rising PSA after surgery and a negative metastatic
             work-up.

          -  Prior use of Lupron therapy or a similar agent is allowed.  Use of Lupron or similar
             agent must be for ≤ 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Use of Casodex and agents in the same drug class is allowed. Age is ≥ 18 years at the
             time of consent.

          -  The ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed consent and
             authorization for the release of health information.
