Serious\n             infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal) within 14 days before administration of\n             [68Ga]MLN6907 or evidence of active infection during screening.\n\n          -  Life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer.\n\n          -  Clinically significant central nervous system (CNS) metastases.\n\n          -  Known inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n          -  Known hepatitis B surface antigen-positive or known or suspected active hepatitis C\n             infection (testing not required).\n\n          -  History of any hypersensitivity to any component of [68Ga]MLN6907.\n\n          -  Symptomatic cardiac disease, including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery\n             disease, or arrhythmias, if this would, in the opinion of the investigator or project\n             clinician, interfere with assessment of efficacy or safety of [68Ga]MLN6907.\n\n          -  Admission or evidence of addictive disorders (eg, illicit drug use, drug abuse, or\n             alcohol abuse) that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n          -  Inability to lie flat for the duration of image acquisition."
