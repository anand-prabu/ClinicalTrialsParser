After 1 year, you will only have additional bone marrow aspirates\n      performed if the study doctor thinks it is necessary.\n\n      If you have no significant side effects during the first 12 months, the number of blood\n      draws and bone marrow collections may be lowered to 1 every 1-3 cycles.\n\n      Length-of-Study:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your\n      best interest.  You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse,\n      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      You will have an end-of-treatment visit 30 days (+/- 7 days) after your last dose of\n      erlotinib.\n\n      At this visit, you will be asked about any symptoms and/or side effects you may have.  The\n      end-of-treatment visit can be done by phone or during one of your standard of care clinic\n      visits at MD Anderson.  If this visit is done by phone, the call should last about 15\n      minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Erlotinib is not FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of AML.  In this disease type, it is currently being used for research\n      purposes only.\n\n      Up to 29 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."

The WHO classification will be used for\n             AML.\n\n          2. Age >/=18 years\n\n          3. ECOG Performance Status </=2\n\n          4. Adequate liver (total bilirubin </=2x ULN, ALT </=2.5x ULN) and renal (creatinine\n             </=2x ULN) function.\n\n          5. Patients must provide written informed consent.\n\n          6. Patients must have been off chemotherapy for 2 weeks prior to entering this study,\n             unless there is evidence of rapidly progressive disease, and must have recovered from\n             the clinically significant toxic effects of that therapy to at least grade 1. Use of\n             hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the\n             start of study therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy.\n\n          7. Patients - both males and females - with reproductive potential (ie, menopausal for\n             less than 1 year and not surgically sterilized) must practice effective contraceptive\n             measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential must provide a\n             negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior to initiation of study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Patients with known allergy or hypersensitivity to erlotinib.\n\n          2. Patients with any other known disease (except carcinoma in-situ) concurrent severe\n             and/or uncontrolled medical condition (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes; cardiovascular\n             disease including congestive heart failure NYHA Class III or IV, myocardial\n             infarction within 6 months, and poorly controlled hypertension; chronic renal\n             failure; or active uncontrolled infection) which, in the opinion of the investigator\n             could compromise participation in the study.\n\n          3. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.\n\n          4. Significant gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with absorption of\n             erlotinib.\n\n          5. Patients who can receive a stem cell transplant within 4 weeks."
