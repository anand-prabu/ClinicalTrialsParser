We aim to demonstrate that\n      biomechanical data (ASP and CCI) might complement morphological data (CL) to improve\n      prediction of preterm delivery. It is expected that women with preterm delivery will show\n      stronger weakening of cervical tissue. Aspiration (ASP) and cervical CCI (cervical\n      consistency index) measurements are performed at mid-pregnancy: detection at this time point\n      is useful for therapy and biomechanical modifications are already significant so to enable\n      differentiation by biomechanical measurements (ASP and CCI)."
