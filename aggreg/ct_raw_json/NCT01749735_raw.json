The functional upper extremity task training takes uses the Armeo Spring\n      robotic arm to support the limb while playing functional task games on the computer.\n\n      Specific Aims:\n\n        1. To demonstrate that tDCS combined with upper extremity functional task training in a\n           virtual environment is more effective than functional task training in a virtual\n           environment with sham tDCS.\n\n        2. To compare cortico-excitatory changes following training with tDCS vs. sham\n           stimulation, using paired- and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation as a tool\n           to measure cortical excitability."
