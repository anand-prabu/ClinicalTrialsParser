  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microembolization is commonly associated with carotid artery stenting (CAS), but our
      understanding of subclinical microembolization is superficial. Through collaborative effects
      of multidisciplinary team-experts, novel approaches, and longitudinal evaluations, we hope
      to better understand the clinical significance and long-term cognitive effects of
      microemboli. This proposal may change our current clinical practice by providing a better
      outcome measure for carotid interventions and improving outcomes of CAS procedures through
      risk factor stratification. Our central hypothesis is that development of subclinical
      microemboli is associated with decline in cognitive function following CAS and that the risk
      of development of microemboli themselves is associated with patient- and procedure-related
      factors.  We hope that this prospective study will help to clarify these important issues in
      the era of rapidly evolving percutaneous interventions.

    <description>Carotid revascularization can significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with severe carotid stenosis; however, it has been associated with cognitive decline in 25% of the older adults who undergo the procedure. Neuroimaging techniques that characterize white matter integrity and regional hypoperfusion have the potential to provide sensitive brain structure indicators that may be associated with memory decline following revascularization procedures. In this proposal, we hope to determine the risk factors and cognitive effect of microembolization following carotid revascularization procedures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is male or female &gt;40 yrs of age.

          -  Patient has occlusive extracranial carotid stenosis (≥70%)

          -  Patient is scheduled to undergo an endovascular intervention of a lesion in the
             extracranial carotid artery

          -  Patient agrees to voluntarily participate and signs an informed consent.

          -  Patient agrees to be available for follow-up and is able to participate in all study
             testing procedures.

          -  Patient has sufficient visual and auditory acuity for cognitive testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is unable to safely and comfortably undergo magnetic resonance imaging
             procedures (e.g., claustrophobia, implanted medical devices that are MRI incompatible
             such as pacemaker, defibrillator, neural stimulator etc)

             (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder).

          -  Patient has prominent suicidal or homicidal ideation.

          -  Patient has acute illness or unstable chronic illness (e.g. uncontrolled
             hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, ascites, and esophageal
             varices, pancreatitis).

          -  Patient with a history of neurological (e.g., multiple sclerosis, seizure disorder,
             Parkinson's disease) or systemic illness affecting central nervous system function.

          -  Patient has prior closed head injury with ≥24 hours of amnesia.

          -  Patient is unable to understand or sign the informed consent.
