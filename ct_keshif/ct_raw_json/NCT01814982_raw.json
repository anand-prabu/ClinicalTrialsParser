The study consists of 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2), and each\n      part will have 2 stages (Stage 1 and Stage 2). In Stage 1 of each part only standard care\n      will be given, through sedation, analgesia and ventilation. If Intra cranial pressure (ICP)\n      rises to greater than 20 millimeter of mercury (mmHG) after ventricular drainage,\n      participants will enter Stage 2 of each part and will receive JNJ-17299425 (single dose in\n      Part 1 and repeated dose in Part 2). During Part 1, safety and efficacy of JNJ-17299425 will\n      be evaluated and during Part 2, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics\n      of repeated doses will be evaluated. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by reduction in\n      ICP. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation at pre and post\n      administration of study treatment.
