If their surgeon recommends a particular incision, there is also a\n      non-randomized cohort. Patients will complete the Breast Q, a questionnaire prior to surgery\n      and three months after surgery to capture quality of life data.  During the surgery,\n      laser-assisted fluorescent angiography will be performed three times to look at blood\n      perfusion with the Spy Elite imaging device.\n\n      Patients will be required to return for postoperative follow up visits: one week, three\n      weeks, six weeks, and three months."
