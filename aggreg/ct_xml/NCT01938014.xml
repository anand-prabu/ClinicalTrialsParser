  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Children diagnosed with a lysosomal disease will exhibit developmental,
      adaptive, and behavioral strengths and difficulties depending upon 1) biomedical risk
      factors (i.e. the specific genetic disorder responsible for the illness); 2) available
      modifying interventions, whether medical or behavioral; and 3) social risks in the
      children's families, neighborhoods and communities.  A valid and reliable telephone-based
      surveillance system can successfully collect the data required to elucidate these
      developmental, adaptive and behavioral strengths and difficulties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who have lysosomal disease experience declines in health status and central nervous
      system integrity which result in motor, communication, self-care, learning and behavioral
      challenges.  Medical interventions such as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can improve the health and functioning of children
      with lysosomal disease.  To date, however, there is no established system for evaluating the
      health status, developmental status, behavioral outcomes or functional outcomes of these
      preschool-aged children across time and differing settings.  The primary objective of this
      study is to develop a valid and reliable telephone-based data-gathering system for obtaining
      health status data, developmental status data, behavioral outcomes data, and functional
      outcomes data which reflect skills of daily living including feeding, moving, communicating
      and responding to others.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the validity of several early-childhood
      standardized assessment tools as compared to the standard neuropsychological assessment
      battery specified by the Lysosomal Disease Network's 'Neurobehavioral Core.'

      The third objective of this study is to describe the impact of lysosomal disease upon the
      families of lysosomal disease-affected children.
