It is hoped that this\n      technique will help doctors provide a higher-quality image of the prostate cancer, making it\n      easier to plan the area that will be treated. Using this type of CT scan will also lessen\n      the amount of time patients spend in the scanner.\n\n      This study will not offer patients a different treatment for their prostate cancer. Patients\n      will receive the most appropriate standard treatment whether or not they are in this study."
