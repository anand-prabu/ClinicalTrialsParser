    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the investigator can help the immune system to work
      against myeloma. Because cancer is produced by the patients own body, the immune system does
      not easily recognize and fight cancer cells. The immune system needs to be &quot;trained&quot; to do
      this.

      This disease has been selected for this study because the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) protein is
      often present in myeloma cells. WT1 is a gene that is involved in the normal development of
      kidneys and other organs. When the WT1 gene becomes abnormal, it can make proteins involved
      in the development of cancer. This study will determine whether the WT1 vaccine causes an
      immune response which is safe and able to keep the myeloma from coming back.

    <description>Vaccinations will be initiated 12-22 days following autologous stem cell transplantation. Six vaccinations of the WT1 peptide preparation (1.0 ml of emulsion) will be administered on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, &amp; 10. All vaccinations will be administered subcutaneously with vaccination sites rotated among extremities. Injection sites will be pre-stimulated with Sargramostim (GM-CSF 70 μg) injected subcutaneously on days -2 &amp; 0 of each vaccination. Note: during each vaccination, the Sargramostim (GM-CSF)&amp; the vaccine emulsion will be administered to the same anatomical site. Patients will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination. Patients, who are clinically stable (no active infection with fevers &amp; no cardiovascular or respiratory compromise) &amp; have not had disease progression, may receive up to 6 more vaccinations administered appropriately every month. The use of post-stem cell transplant maintenance with lenalidomide is allowed starting 3 months or more after transplant.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic multiple myeloma, ISS stage 1-3 with confirmed diagnosis of multiple
             myeloma at MSKCC

             institutional criteria

          -  Patients must have documented WT1 positive disease. For purpose of this study, this
             is defined as detectable presence of WT1 expression by immunohistochemistry or by WT1
             transcript via RT-PCR on a bone marrow performed at MSKCC prior to autologous stem
             cell transplantation. Bone marrow specimen from time of diagnosis from patients
             diagnosed at MSKCC or OSH may be requested for assessment of WT1 expression by IHC
