In addition, in our experience, no negative\n      surgical outcomes (in terms of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative\n      hospital stay, postoperative return to normal activity and complication rate) are related to\n      PBS step in TLH.\n\n      Although the good statistical reliability of our retrospective data, we want to\n      prospectively confirm our results. Moreover we aim to refine PBS safety demonstration by\n      collecting also 3D ultrasound parameters [AFC, ovarian volume (OV), Vascularization Index\n      (VI), Flow Index (FI) and Vascularization Flow Index (VFI)]. Hormonal and ultrasonographic\n      parameters may possibly be unified into a new diagnostic algorithm (already at an advanced\n      stage of production in UMG Department) able to estimate the ovarian function both in term of\n      reproductive ability that in term of distance from menopause."

Specifically, one month before and three months after laparoscopy, on day 1\n      to 4 of menstrual cycles serum AMH, FSH and E2 will be evaluated and a transvaginal\n      ultrasound examination (Voluson E8 Expert or Voluson-i - GE Healthcare Ultrasound) to assess\n      AFC, OV, VI, FI and VFI, will be carried out by the same experienced ultrasonographist\n      responsible for the ambulatory of ovarian reserve in each Unit.\n\n      Ovarian reserve modification will be defined as the difference (expressed as \u0394) between\n      post-operative and pre-operative values of AMH, FSH, AFC, OV, VI, FI and VFI. For each\n      surgical procedure, moreover, operative time, variation of hemoglobin level, postoperative\n      hospital stay, postoperative return to normal activity and complication rate will be\n      recorded as secondary outcomes."
