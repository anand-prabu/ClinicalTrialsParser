However, most\n      patients with NSCLC who respond to EGFR-TKIs eventually experience progression of disease\n      after approximately 12 months. The lack of an established therapeutic option for NSCLC\n      patients who have progressive disease after EGFR-TKIs failure poses a great challenge to\n      physicians in terms of how best to manage this growing group of lung cancer patients.\n\n      In clinical practice some of the initially EGFR-TKI sensitive tumors which progressed\n      evidence a striking increase in tumor volume within several weeks, after being taken off\n      EGFR-TKI. This response is called \"rebound phenomenon\". Most experts still believe that\n      these tumors continue to be \"oncogene-addicted\" to EGFR. So it is rational that EGFR-TKI\n      combined with another chemotherapy regimen can be used to treat NSCLC after the failure of\n      EGFR-TKI therapy.\n\n      However in some phase \u2161clinical trials involved a few NSCLC patients who failed to EGFR-TKI\n      therapy, another treatment mode, that is to say, at least one cytotoxic chemotherapy was\n      used firstly then switched to EGFR-TKI therapy until progression of disease, was used and\n      called reintroduction or retreatment of EGFR-TKI. Using this treatment mode, some\n      investigators reported the partial remission (PR) and disease control rate (DCR) were\n      observed in 21.7%-36% and 65.2%-86% NSCLC patients."
