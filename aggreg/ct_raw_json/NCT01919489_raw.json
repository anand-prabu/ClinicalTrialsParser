Improved glucose control with insulin\n      injections may improve clinical outcome and prevent some of the hospital complications.\n      Increasing evidence indicates that incretin-based agents are safe and effective for the\n      hospital management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).\n\n      Liraglutide is a once-daily human glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogue approved for the\n      treatment of T2D. Liraglutide has been shown to lower blood glucose, stimulate endogenous\n      insulin secretion, decrease plasma glucagon levels, inhibit gastric emptying, reduce food\n      intake and body weight and improve \u00df-cell function when administered subcutaneously.\n      Liraglutide increases insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner (i.e., only when\n      plasma glucose levels are elevated), resulting in low-risk of hypoglycemia when used as\n      monotherapy. When compared to insulin glargine therapy, the use of GLP-1 has resulted in\n      comparable reduction in HbA1c level, lower rates of hypoglycemia and less weight gain.  No\n      prospective studies; however, have compared the efficacy and safety of liraglutide in the\n      hospital setting or after hospital discharge.\n\n      The primary objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of liraglutide (Victoza\u00ae) versus\n      glargine insulin in combination to oral anti-diabetic agents (OADs: metformin,\n      sulfonylureas, nateglinide, repaglinide or pioglitazone) on glycemic control after 26 weeks\n      of treatment in medicine patients with T2D after hospital discharge."
