            "textblock": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major worldwide health issue. Figures from the Centers for\n      Disease control show that 1.7 million people suffer a TBI annually.   Meanwhile the World\n      Health Organization recognizes TBI as one of the most significant health issues in\n      developing countries.  In the military, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is one of the\n      most frequent sequela of modern war.   Dizziness and balance disorders are the most frequent\n      sequela of mTBI and account for a significant degree of mTBI morbidity.  At the current\n      time, the best treatment modality for dizziness secondary to mTBI is vestibular\n      rehabilitation (VR).  While VR is effective, the therapy is time consuming, not universally\n      successful, and results in incomplete recovery by many patients.  Work needs to be done in\n      an attempt to improve therapy outcomes.  This project will study the use of neuromodulation\n      (through stimulation of the tongue) as an adjuvant to improve the effectiveness of VR and\n      reduce the time involved in VR.  Given past work with variants on this minimal medical\n      impact appliance, using the PoNS\u2122 device to augment therapy may result in a significant\n      improvement in VR outcomes.  Given the enormous public health and military burden of mTBI,\n      and given that dizziness is a major component often responsible for significant morbidity,\n      this project has significant military and civilian impact and can be beneficial to those who\n      suffer mTBI worldwide."
