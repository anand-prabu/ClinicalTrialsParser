These interventions are becoming increasingly\n      popular in cancer survivors.  However, little is known about the feasibility and effect of\n      MBIs administered during the interval of time of chemotherapy, on QOL and stress.  The\n      investigators are planning a MBI intervention study developed specifically for breast cancer\n      survivors receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months) at the investigators institution, for\n      at least 8 sessions combined with at least 8 weeks of home-practice, in 25 women receiving\n      chemotherapy for breast cancer."
