      Hypothesis: The investigators propose that obese parturients will have an increased
      inflammatory response and a decreased anti-inflammatory response to the surgical and
      anesthetic insult of caesarean section and that this will be associated with a higher rate
      of perioperative complications, as compared to non-obese parturients.2 Background: Obese
      patients exhibit higher levels of inflammatory markers than non-obese patients. Furthermore,
      obese patients have a higher incidence of perioperative complications, especially wound
      infections, and this is well documented in the caesarean section population. The pregnant
      population is unique as a result of the immunologic changes that occur at baseline, and an
      increase in pro-inflammatory markers is seen in serum and in placental tissue of obese
      subjects, and has been demonstrated to correlate with adverse fetal outcomes.

      Specific Objectives: To determine the baseline levels of three established markers of
      inflammation in term pregnant obese and non-obese patients (defined by a BMI &gt; and &lt; 35
      kg/M2 respectively), and examine how they change in response to the stress of
      surgery/anesthesia. The investigators will correlate the inflammatory response with the
      incidence of postoperative wound infections.

      Methods: Patients will be recruited to the study prior to the planned caesarean section.
      Blood samples for inflammatory marker levels will be performed preoperatively, immediately
      postoperatively, and at 24 hours postoperatively. Samples will be analyzed for pentraxin-3
      (a relatively novel inflammatory marker), C reactive protein (CRP) (a well-known and
      clinically relevant inflammatory marker), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) (an established
      anti-inflammatory marker).  Plasma will be analyzed by ELISA to determine levels of each
      biomarker.  Patient charts will be reviewed to determine which patients have experienced
      surgical complications in the 30 days postoperatively. Surgical complications will then be
      correlated with the measured levels of inflammatory markers.

      Assuming that the levels of inflammatory cytokines in obese patients will be 15% higher in
      obese parturients and assuming an alpha error level of 5% and a beta error level of 20%, the
      investigators would need to study 18 patients per group to prove our hypothesis that
      inflammatory cytokine levels are correlated with postoperative infections.  The
      investigators plan to study 20 patients per group to account for a potential patient
      attrition rate of 10% during the study.

      Significance/Importance: The connection between obesity and dysregulation of the
      perioperative inflammatory response has not been well established nor has perioperative
      inflammation in the obese population been linked to the observed increased in perioperative
      morbidity.  The investigators hope to demonstrate these connections and hopefully will be
      able to identify at risk patients earlier, and in a subsequent study intervene to reduce the
      risk of postoperative wound infections with pharmacokinetically targeted antimicrobial
      prophylaxis.

        We will undertake a prospective cohort study to examine the levels of circulating
        inflammatory cytokines in obese and non-obese parturients undergoing elective cesarean
        section and correlate them with the rate of postoperative wound infections. We will
        recruit 20 patients in each arm of the study.
