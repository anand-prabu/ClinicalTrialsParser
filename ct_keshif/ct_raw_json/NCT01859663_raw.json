            "textblock": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 6-12% of\n      reproductive-aged women within the general population. There has been evidence to suggest\n      women whom present with obesity and/or insulin resistance are at higher risk for developing\n      PCOS. This condition is associated with negative health implications. Women with PCOS women\n      are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular\n      disease compared to age- and weight- matched controls, indicating PCOS may increase an\n      individual's susceptibility for chronic disease.\n\n      Current research has failed to thoroughly examine the relationships between dietary intake,\n      energy expenditure and PCOS.  The purpose of this proposed study is to identify lifestyle\n      factors associated with PCOS. Through dietary intake and energy expenditure data, the\n      researchers plan to examine potential lifestyle differences between PCOS and healthy women,\n      as well as between BMI classifications within women with PCOS.  The Research Team will also\n      be able to evaluate the diet quality according to the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n      of all women included in the study. The Research Team is also interested in the\n      relationships between biological markers and lifestyle endpoints in women with and without\n      PCOS. Previous literature has shown there are biological marker differences between those\n      with and without PCOS. By examining these relationships, researchers may further understand\n      whether PCOS status is associated with lifestyle parameters.\n\n      To accomplish these objectives, 80 women (40 women with PCOS, 40 women without PCOS) will be\n      included in this study. Participants will be between 18 and 38 years, with BMI \u2265 18.5 kg/m2\n      and will not have use of oral contraceptives within the last three months. Women will be\n      included in the PCOS group if they have a confirmed PCOS diagnosis from their primary care\n      provider. Participants will complete a food frequency questionnaire and physical activity\n      questionnaire. A researcher may also provide participants with an accelerometer to wear for\n      a week. Ultrasound scans of the ovaries will be assessed for the total number and size of\n      follicles using both two- and three-dimensional imaging techniques. Participants will have\n      blood samples collected determine LH, FSH, estrogens, and progesterone levels. The following\n      metabolic parameters will be assessed: (1) 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test to\n      characterize glucose and insulin dynamics at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-glucose\n      ingestion; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify body fat and lean muscle\n      distribution; (3) vitals and anthropometry assessment to measure waist and hip\n      circumference, height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, and (4) fasting blood tests\n      to detect androgens (i.e., total testosterone, androstenedione, free androgen index) and\n      serum markers of metabolic syndrome (i.e., lipids and hemoglobin A1C)."
