    <textblock>
      The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) Health and Exposure Survey is designed to
      gather health, family history of disease, environmental exposures and lifestyle data on
      adult EPR subjects. The EPR is a registry established to collect and store DNA samples from
      20,000 volunteers from North Carolina and to serve as a resource to scientist investigating
      genotype-driven translational research of chronic conditions. Under this new protocol, we
      will administer a health and exposures survey to all EPR subjects. The information collected
      in the survey will be used to better characterize the EPR population thus making it more
      useful to NIEHS researchers. The survey contains approximately 200 questions. Data from the
      survey will help researchers develop hypotheses, design follow-up studies, and select
      appropriate subjects.

      The survey will be administered to EPR subjects using a modified version of the Dillman
      Total Design Method (TDM) for surveys. This method requires following specific
      time-dependent steps for survey administration that incorporate both self- and phone
      administration and other types of phone and mail contact. The goal of TDM is to maximize
      subject response rates.
