      Purpose: To determine the acute effects of a mushroom blend vs. placebo on oxygen kinetics,
      aerobic power and time to fatigue in healthy adults.

      Participants: Twenty-eight, healthy, active, recreationally-trained adults ages 18-35.

      Procedures (methods): All subjects will report to the Applied Physiology Laboratory in
      Fetzer Rm 025 for phase I of the study for a total of 7 visits. A randomly selected subset
      of 8 participants will continue to phase II, and return to the lab for an additional 3
      visits to evaluate feasibility. Visit 1 will consist of a physical, enrollment and
      consenting. Visits, 2, 3, and 4 will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours. During visit 2,
      participants will perform a maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) test on a cycle ergometer.
      During visit 3 participants will be asked to complete a 6-minute oxygen kinetics test on a
      cycle ergometer; lactate threshold and oxygen saturation will be measured at baseline,
      minutes 2, 3 and 6 during the 6 min ride. During visit 4, participants will perform a
      3-minute critical power (CP) test and will provide a saliva sample, to be measured for
      cortisol levels, immediately prior to and after the CP test. Following visit 4, participants
      will be randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to either a placebo or mushroom blend
      treatment group. Participants in the placebo and treatment groups will be asked to consume 2
      servings, 3 times daily for 7 days. Following supplementation, participants will return to
      the laboratory for visits 5-7, each of which will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours. The
      same protocol performed during visits 2-4 will be repeated in the same order for visits 5-7;
      the VO 2max test, the 6 min oxygen kinetics test, and the CP test with a pre and post saliva
      sample. The randomly selected subset of 8 participants will continue into phase II (n=4 for
      treatment; n=4 for placebo). During phase II, the 8 participants in the placebo and
      treatment groups will be asked to consume 2 servings, 3 times daily for 14 additional days
      to determine feasibility of a longer supplementation phase. Following supplementation, the
      same protocol performed during visits 2-4 will be repeated in the same order for visits
      8-10, each of which will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours.
