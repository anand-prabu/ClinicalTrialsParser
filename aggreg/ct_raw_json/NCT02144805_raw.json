Surgical technique was\n      blinded for the investigator.\n\n      Setting: An obstetric department in a tertiary referral hospital, 2008-2013. Participants:\n      Healthy nulliparous scheduled for elective caesarean section randomly assigned to closure of\n      the uterine incision by single- or double layer techniques.\n\n      Intervention: A modified version of the Misgav-Ladach surgical technique was used. The women\n      were examined by abdominal ultra sound before discharge from the maternity ward, and by\n      vaginal ultra sound and hysterosonography minimum five month post partum.\n\n      Main outcome measure: Thickness of the remaining myometrium corresponding to the former\n      cesarean uterine incision measured by ultra sound."
