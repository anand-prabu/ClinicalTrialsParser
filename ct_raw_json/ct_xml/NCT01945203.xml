  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD), which means that it is important to find out risk factors of CVD in
      order to prevent or treat it. In recent years, there has been more and more recognition of a
      very high prevalence of CV calcification in the ESRD population.  Many observational cohort
      studies have shown that CV calcification in these patients can predict mortality, CV
      mortality and morbidity.  Electrolyte imbalance is easily found in the ESRD patients which
      may result in vessel calcification. Calcification leads to arterial stenosis and increasing
      arterial stiffness and then heart afterload, both contribute to the development of CVD.
      Besides, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia pave the way for a
      chronic, immune-mediated vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease. These factors are
      prevalent in ESRD patients, which would also cause arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness
      and stenosis would increase the risk of CV events and mortality. Aortic pulse wave velocity
      is strongly associated with the presence and extent of atherosclerosis and constitutes a
      forceful marker and predictor of cardiovascular risk. At the same time, high prevalence of
      peripheral artery occlusion disease (PAOD) should also be found while arterial stiffness and
      stenosis, which would increase the condition of infection and gangrene. Thus, life safety
      and quality would be influenced severely and early detection might prevent future
      amputation. As compared with HD or pre-dialysis patients, uremic patients treated with PD
      have a higher risk for metabolic syndrome. Therefore, more studies to evaluate the condition
      of arterial stiffness and PAOD, especially in PD patients, are needed for future management
      and preventions of CV related morbidity and mortality.
