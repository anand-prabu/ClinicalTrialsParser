To evaluate the effect of a brief educational program on colorectal cancer knowledge\n      acquisition in a 3-arm randomized clinical trial (Control Group: standard of care; Treatment\n      Group 1: cancer education; Treatment Group 2: mindfulness + cancer education) comparing\n      visual/written educational material with and without mindfulness training to the standard of\n      care.\n\n      II. To determine the priming effect of a brief mindfulness training on retaining knowledge\n      of colorectal cancer education.\n\n      III. To determine the joint effect of colorectal cancer education delivered to both the\n      patient and a caregiver on the overall colorectal cancer knowledge.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To examine the relative changes in psychobiological variables (stress, anxiety,\n      depression, mindfulness, fatigue, life benefit) from pre (T0) to post (T1) intervention (at\n      least 1-week apart) in the 3 arms of the clinical trials.\n\n      II. To measure changes in salivary cortisol levels as an indicator of acute stress\n      reactivity across 4 time points across a one-hour period (i.e., 0 min, 20 min, 40 min, 60\n      min) during active chemotherapy (T1).\n\n      III. To determine the moderating effect of baseline peripheral levels of inflammation\n      (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, c-reactive protein [CRP] and tumor necrosis factor alpha\n      [TNFa]) on the trajectory of salivary cortisol reactivity.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients and caregivers are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.\n\n      GROUP I: Patients and caregivers receive standard of care.\n\n      GROUP II: Patients and caregivers receive a 20-minute self-playing interactive educational\n      video brochure.\n\n      GROUP III: Patients and caregivers receive a 20-minute self-playing interactive educational\n      video brochure and watch a 20-minute interactive mindfulness exercise video."
