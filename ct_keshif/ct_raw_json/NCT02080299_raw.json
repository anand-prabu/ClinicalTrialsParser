But since no true data exist regarding RIPC and TAVI, interim analysis will be\n           performed after 50 patients per group.\n\n        -  After induction of conscious sedation or general anaesthesia, RIPC is accomplished by 3\n           cycles of 5 min inflation/5 min deflation of a blood pressure cuff around the left arm\n           to 200 mm Hg. In the placebo group, the blood pressure cuff remains uninflated for 30\n           min.\n\n        -  Blind: study coordinators, outcome assessors, operators and treating physicians except\n           for the attending anaesthetist.\n\n        -  Drugs used for conscious sedation: midazolam, remifentanil.\n\n        -  Drugs used for general anaesthesia: sufentanil, etomidate, rocuronium, isoflurane.\n\n        -  TAVI is performed by standard techniques using the balloon-expandable Sapien XT\n           (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, California, USA) and the next-generation Sapien 3\n           stent-valve bioprosthesis which replaces the Sapien XT prosthesis, when CE-approved.\n\n        -  Arterial blood samples are obtained prior to and after RIPC-maneuver/Placebo, after\n           aortic valve implantation and after access site closure, for biochemical analyses\n           focussing on ligands that have been previously implicated in conditioning protocols at\n           various organs. A bioassay system, consisting of a Langendorff-perfused isolated heart\n           with ischemia and reperfusion will be used. This bioassay system will be exposed to the\n           obtained arterial plasma of the patients.\n\n        -  Venous blood samples are drawn before TAVI and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after\n           the procedure.\n\n        -  Cardiac and cerebral MRI is performed in selected patients at baseline and within the\n           first week after TAVI.\n\n        -  On-site follow-up at 3\u00b13 months, 12\u00b13 months and yearly thereafter."
