The dose escalation schedule consists of different dose levels: 2 mg/day (level -1), 3 mg/day (level 1, starting dose level), 5 mg/day (level 2), 7 mg/day (level 3), 10 mg/day (level 4). Dose escalation is to be determined by dose limiting toxicity (DLT). In the MTD expanded cohort, the maximal tolerated dose of pomalidomide as determined by phase I will be used.\nPatients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. In the first and second cycles of treatment, pomalidomide is given with dexamethasone 40 mg PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Pomalidomide alone is given after the second cycle of treatment. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity."

Blood brain barrier is an obstacle in\n      treatment of brain tumors such as CNS lymphoma. Pomalidomide was shown to have an excellent\n      CNS penetration in a murine model: approximately 39% of systemically administered\n      pomalidomide could penetrate the central nervous system. As such, pomalidomide is a\n      promising immunomodulator to be tested in a clinical trial for CNS lymphoma. It works by\n      killing the lymphoma cells directly as well as indirectly via activation of the immune\n      response against lymphoma cells."
