Also, Zolpidem (Ambien) will not be\n      permitted in the 24 hours pre-infusion. If a person chooses to participate, their dose of\n      benzodiazepine may need to be reduced so that they can do without it during the 24 hours\n      pre-infusion.\n\n      Participants are randomly assigned to receive a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or\n      Midazolam (0.02 mg/kg), which is given slowly, in a vein, over about 40 minutes. The study\n      is \"double-blind,\" meaning patients and study staff will not know which medication is in the\n      infusion.\n\n      If a patient does not respond to the first infusion, and s/he received Midazolam, then s/he\n      will be offered the option of a second infusion, this time with Ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). After\n      the infusion(s), participants will have weekly research interviews for 6 weeks to monitor\n      response.\n\n      After post-infusion research measures are completed, all subjects will receive open clinical\n      treatment. During open clinical treatment, medication will be changed for those patients who\n      don't respond or whose response is transient.\n\n      Participation in this study requires a brief inpatient stay, at no cost, at the New York\n      State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI).\n\n      Eligible participants enrolled in this study will be offered medication management visits at\n      no cost for a total of up to 6 months combining inpatient and outpatient treatment. At the\n      end of the 6 months of treatment patients will be referred for ongoing care."
