The patients will be required to have received a prior\n      IV bortezomib containing combination regimen that did not contain thalidomide or vincristine\n      and that differs from the SC bortezomib-containing one.  In between the time that the\n      patient received the IV bortezomib-based combination regimen and enrollment onto this study,\n      patients may have received other non-bortezomib-based regimens as long as these treatments\n      did not contain thalidomide or vincristine.  This study will enroll patients who have\n      relapsed or have become refractory to their prior IV-administered bortezomib-containing\n      combination regimen as demonstrated by progressive disease while on or following that\n      regimen.  Patients must have received 4 doses of a minimum of 1.0 mg/m2 of bortezomib\n      administered IV in no more than 4 weeks per cycle.  Patients must have received at least one\n      cycle meeting this definition and have shown progressive disease to be considered eligible.\n      Patients who have relapsed or have become refractory to their most recent IV\n      bortezomib-containing combination regimen are eligible regardless of when they received that\n      regimen, as long as they meet the above criteria.\n\n      The study will consist of a screening period, followed by up to eight open label treatment\n      cycles, a final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle, and a\n      follow-up period."
