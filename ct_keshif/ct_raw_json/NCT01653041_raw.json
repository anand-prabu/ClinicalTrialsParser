            "textblock": "Recipients from living donors kidneys HLA-identical were lower risk for acute rejection,\n      graft loss or death. There is no clear definition of what is ideal immunosuppressive regimen\n      for this population.\n\n      Everolimus (EVR) was associated with lower incidence of viral infections and also the lowest\n      incidence of neoplasms. Furthermore, immunosuppressive regimens based everolimus allow the\n      reduction or elimination of calcineurin inhibitors reducing cardiovascular risks associated\n      with chronic use of these agents. Moreover, the use of EVR is associated with increased\n      incidence of proteinuria, which associated mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Knowing\n      that proteinuria may be the first indication of recurrence of the underlying renal disease,\n      detailed information about the patient's medical history and histological analysis of the\n      graft may contribute with additional knowledge in this area.\n\n      The aim of this prospective, open, single arm study that will be performed only in the\n      Hospital do Rim e Hipertens\u00e3o, is investigating the outcomes of kidney transplantation in\n      recipients of HLA identical living donor, receiving an everolimus-based immunosuppressive\n      regimen. This will include 100 recipients of first or second kidney transplant from a living\n      donor HLA identical to the Kidney and Hypertension Hospital, which will be followed by a\n      period of 12 months."
