            "textblock": "This exploratory and observational study focuses on adults with an intellectual disability\n      (ID) caused by Down Syndrome and their support workers. Adults with ID due to a non-genetic\n      cause constitute the control group. All clients have a mild to moderate ID and use a form of\n      Alternative Augmentative Communication (AAC). Approximately half of adults with ID is\n      estimated to experience communication difficulties. AAC supports them in their daily\n      communication aiming at optimal participation in society. Current communication models, such\n      as Participation Model (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2005) and ICF (WHO, 2001), regard both client\n      related and environmental factors as important elements of communication. A substantial part\n      of the environmental factors is made up of the communication partners' characteristics. In\n      daycare and residential services for adults with ID an important communication partner\n      constitutes the support worker.\n\n      This study aims to:\n\n        1. with regard to teaching KeyWordSigning (KWS), a specific form of AAC, to support\n           workers:\n\n           Analyse the relation between training method, support workers' attitude, and short and\n           long term sign knowledge.\n\n        2. with regard to the use of AAC in everyday communication between support workers and\n           adults with ID:\n\n             -  Identity the support workers' characteristics that may influence the\n                quality/quantity of the communication between adults with ID who use AAC and their\n                support worker.\n\n             -  Analyse the nature of this influence as well as any possible interaction effects\n                with the clients' characteristics."
