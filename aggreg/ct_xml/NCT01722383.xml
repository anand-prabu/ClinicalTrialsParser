  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 16% of the adult population and is associated
      with significant morbidity and mortality. People at highest risk from progressive CKD are
      defined by a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and/or the
      presence of significant albuminuria/proteinuria. Accurate mapping of the bio-clinical
      determinants of this group will enable improved risk stratification and direct the
      development of better targeted management for people with CKD. To address these requirements
      we have established the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) study; RIISC is enrolling
      a cohort of patients at high risk from progressive CKD and compiling a comprehensive and
      detailed bio-clinical phenotype, including vascular and oral health phenotyping, at
      enrolment and on subsequent follow-up.
