  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, non-randomized, open label, single-dose, two-period, cross-over study.
      This study will utilize 14C radiolabeled GSK1322322 to investigate the recovery, excretion,
      and pharmacokinetics of GSK1322322 in 6 healthy adult male subjects through the sampling of
      blood, urine, and feces.

      Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 7 to 8 weeks i.e., 30 day
      screening period, two dosing periods (approximately 8 days each) and a follow up visit.

      The subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day 1 of the first treatment period
      and remain in the unit for up to approximately 16 days through the end of the second
      treatment period.

      On Day 1 of Period 1, each subject will receive 14C radiolabeled GSK1322322 as a single
      therapeutic intravenous (IV) dose (1000 milligrams [mg]). When the total radioactivity is
      &lt;1% of the administered dose in all subjects, Period 2 dosing will begin (approximately 8
      days after the IV dose). On Day 1 of Period 2, each subject will receive single therapeutic
      oral solution dose (1200 mg). Blood, urine, bile and fecal samples will be collected during
      both the periods. The subject may be discharged from the unit as early as Day 8 of Period 2.
      Subjects will visit the study unit for the follow-up visit 7 to 10 days following discharge
      from the unit.

    <measure>Plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of GSK1322322 and radiolabeled compound following single IV or oral solution dose: AUC(0-infinity), AUC(0-t), Cmax, tmax, t1/2 for IV and oral solution regimens and CL and Vss for IV regimen only</measure>

    <description>Plasma PK parameters will be statistically summarized by treatment. Plasma concentration-time data will be analyzed by non-compartmental methods. Following PK parameters will be studied: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time [AUC(0-infinity)], AUC(0-t), maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax), terminal phase half-life (t1/2) for IV and oral solution regimens and systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) for IV regimen only.</description>
