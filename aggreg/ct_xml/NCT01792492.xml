    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the usefulness of an optical probe in the differentiation of
      thyroid cancer from normal thyroid tissue in a thyroidectomy specimen.

      The optical real-time readings will be compared to the histological analysis from the same
      area. Subjects undergoing thyroid surgery for thyroid disease including thyroid nodules,
      thyroid cancer and thyroid goiter with nodules will be eligible to participate. After the
      removal of the thyroid gland, optical readings will be taken from the ex vivo thyroid gland
      and these same areas will then be analyzed in the usual standard fashion. The reading will
      then be correlated with the histological results. In addition, if lymph nodes are removed as
      part of the surgery they will also be tested prior to histological standard processing. All
      specimens and data will be de-identified.

    <description>The objective is to assess a device called an optical probe for the differentiation of thyroid cancer from normal thyroid tissue, benign thyroid nodules or parathyroid glands, and the detection of thyroid cancer within lymph nodes using a hand-held spectroscope, compare the spectra from benign and malignant thyroid nodules and use this to discriminate benign from malignant nodules based on final histopathology or cytology as the gold standard.</description>
