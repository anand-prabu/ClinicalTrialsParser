Radiation therapy uses high-energy\n      x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining dalteparin with radiation therapy may kill more\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining dalteparin with radiation\n      therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma\n      multiforme."

Beginning concurrently with\n      initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive dalteparin subcutaneously once daily for up to\n      2 years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue receiving dalteparin\n      after year 2 at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 5 years\n      after study entry.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study."
