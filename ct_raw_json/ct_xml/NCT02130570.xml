  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to design and implement a set of procedures (the
      intervention) to improve patients' experiences when they are discharged home from the
      hospital.  Second, this study aims to look at how the intervention affects problems that are
      known to occur after discharge, including medication issues, worsening medical problems, or
      readmission to the hospital.  The investigators will study how well patients recover the
      ability to do the things they could before they were admitted to the hospital and their
      opinions of the discharge process.  Lastly, this study will look to understand the best way
      to implement the intervention into different hospitals and practices, and which types of
      patients benefit from it most.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To develop, implement, and refine a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary transitions
           intervention with contributions from hospital and Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH)
           personnel.

           Hypothesis: a collaborative transitions intervention can be designed and implemented
           within an ACO that reliably provides the components of an ideal transition in care.

        2. To evaluate the effects of this intervention on post-discharge adverse events,
           functional status, patient engagement, and emergency department and hospital
           utilization within 30 days of discharge.

           Hypothesis: compared with usual care, a collaborative transitions intervention will
           decrease post discharge adverse events, improve post-discharge functional status,
           increase patient engagement, and reduce emergency department and hospital utilization
           in the post-discharge period.

        3. To understand barriers to and facilitators of successful implementation of this
           intervention across practices.

      Hypothesis: several barriers to and facilitators of implementation can be identified and
      used to create lessons learned for other health systems to successfully implement this type
      of intervention.

    <description>During the inpatient enrollment period, patients will complete a modified Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-12 (SF-12) regarding functional status and health-related quality of life one month prior to admission. 30 days after discharge, SF12 questions will be repeated so that functional status can be compared to prior to admission.</description>

    <description>During the 30 day post-discharge follow-up phone call we will ask patients about their participation in, understanding of, and ability to carry out the post-discharge plan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects will be adult patients admitted to medical and surgical services at BWH
        and MGH, likely to be discharged back to the community, and whose PCP belongs to one of
        the Partners Community Healthcare, Inc. (PCHI) primary care practices that has met
        &quot;Primed&quot; criteria for being a PCMH, admits at least 2 patients to BWH or MGH, and has
        agreed to participate. Primed criteria are a standard set of requirements that cover 6
        essential building blocks of PCMH practices: electronic health record, patient portal,
        team-based care, practice redesign, care management, and identification of high-risk
        patients. We estimate that of the approximately 300 PCHI adult primary care practices, 150
        of them will meet PCMH criteria during the study and that 50 of them will qualify and be
        willing to participate in the study. We estimate that 12,000 such patients will be
        admitted to BWH and MGH over the 18-month study period. These patients are broadly
        representative of hospitalized patients and include several vulnerable populations,
        including the elderly (33% 65 or older), patients with multiple chronic conditions (47%
        with Elixhauser comorbidity score 5 or more), and racial and ethnic minorities (14%
        African American, 13% Latino).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Likely discharge to a location other than home (or to a caregiver's home)

          2. Police custody

          3. No telephone or homeless

          4. Previous enrolment in the study

          5. Patient unable to communicate in either English or Spanish
