Define surgical and histopathologic parameters predictive of local and distant outcomes\n      (e.g. grade, lymphovascular space invasion [LVSI], extent of resection/lymph node dissection\n      [LND]).\n\n      III. Assess quality of life (QoL) outcomes after this treatment using a standardized\n      questionnaires (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G], FACT-Bladder\n      Cancer [BL], Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] Bowel and Urinary).\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Within 12 weeks of surgical resection, patients undergo 3D conformal radiation therapy once\n      daily 5 days per week for 28 fractions. Treatment continues in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for\n      2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter."
