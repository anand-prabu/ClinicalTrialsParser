            "textblock": "The Eustachian tube is a biological tube that connects the back of the nose to the middle\n      ear.  It is usually closed but needs to be actively opened by the action of certain muscles\n      during swallowing, yawning, and other activities which keeps the air pressure in the middle\n      ear (the part of the ear behind the eardrum) the same as the air pressure in the\n      environment.  If the Eustachian tube does not open during swallowing, the middle-ear\n      pressure progressively decreases and persons may have the feeling of a \"stuffed up\" and/or\n      \"full\" middle ear, may have difficulty hearing and/or may develop fluid in their middle ear.\n\n      The usual treatment for a Eustachian tube that does not open well is to insert a tiny tube\n      (called a ventilation or tympanostomy tube) into the eardrum to keep the air pressure in the\n      middle ear the same as in the environment.  However, those tubes naturally \"fall out\" over\n      time, and if the Eustachian tube opening function had not improved while they were in place,\n      new tubes will need to be inserted.  In the past few years, doctors in the U.S. and Europe\n      described a simple procedure called \"balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube\" (BDET) or\n      \"balloon tuboplasty\" that they believe corrects the underlying cause of Eustachian tube\n      dysfunction and resolves its symptoms, signs and consequences.  For that procedure, a tiny\n      balloon is inserted into the Eustachian tube, inflated to physically open the Eustachian\n      tube, deflated and then removed.  Doctors who have used the method in adults and children\n      with symptoms of Eustachian tube dysfunction reported that BDET is safe and causes a\n      short-term and, perhaps, a long-term resolution of symptoms.  However, no one has measured\n      Eustachian tube function before and after the procedure, and it is not known if BDET truly\n      improves that function or not, and if so, how that function is changed.\n\n      In this study, we will enroll adult subjects with a tympanostomy tube inserted into at least\n      one eardrum for physician-diagnosed Eustachian tube dysfunction or middle-ear fluid and\n      document the presence/absence of measurable Eustachian tube dysfunction using standard\n      tests.  If present, we will determine if the Eustachian tube dysfunction improves after\n      medical treatment of other diseases known to cause Eustachian tube dysfunction. If the\n      Eustachian tube dysfunction does not significantly improve, we will perform the BDET\n      procedure and measure the change in Eustachian tube function at different times after the\n      procedure."
