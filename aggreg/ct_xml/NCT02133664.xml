      The primary aim is to collect data to determine the correct effect size on the primary
      outcome to aid in the design of a larger study: The primary outcome is to determine if
      lipoic acid and omega-3 fatty acids can improve cognitive function in people with multiple
      sclerosis that have cognitive dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>

      The study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. The
      primary aim of the study is to determine if lipoic acid and omega-3 fatty acids can improve
      cognitive function over 12-weeks in people with multiple sclerosis that have a baseline
      score of at least two standard deviations below normative values on any one of four
      cognitive tests that include, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), Stroop Color-Word
      Test, California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), and Controlled Oral Word Association
      Test (COWAT).

      The secondary aim is to determine treatment effects on markers of endothelial inflammation,
      insulin dysregulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction that may be related to cognitive
      dysfunction by measuring s-ICAM-1 levels, homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),
      and MRI phosphorus imaging in a subset of study participants. The study will also measure
      safety by adverse event reports and laboratory measures; plasma fatty acid levels; serum
      lipoic acid levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • A definite diagnosis of MS  with relapsing remitting or secondary progressive
             course

               -  Age 18 to 65 years, inclusive

               -  A score two or more standard deviations below the mean in one or more of the
                  following cognitive tests: PASAT, COWAT, CVLT -II, Stroop

               -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-7.5, inclusive

               -  Suboptimal omega-3 levels (plasma DHA + EPA &lt; 5.0% of total plasma fatty acids)

               -  If taking MS disease modifying medications, on stable dose for &gt; 6 months
                  preceding enrollment

               -  Able to read and write English

        Exclusion Criteria:
