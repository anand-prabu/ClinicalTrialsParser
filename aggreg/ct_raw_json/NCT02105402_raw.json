Furthermore, in the PROMPT approach specific techniques are used to stimulate sensory input that are assumed to facilitate the formation of sensory-motor pathways required for the acquisition and accurate production of speech movement patterns. As the speech motor behaviors are established, the clinician reduces the number of cues and the frequency and immediacy of feedback and practices transfer and generalization activities.",
