Patients are stratified according to concurrent\n      enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients receive oral CC-5013 weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to\n      12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CC-5013 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3\n      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 80 patients (40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 20 months."
