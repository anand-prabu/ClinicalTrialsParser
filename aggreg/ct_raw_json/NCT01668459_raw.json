            "textblock": "Bladder cancer was the 9th most common cause of cancer worldwide in 2002. About 70% of\n      patients have superficial tumour and 30% have invasive tumour at diagnosis.  Patients with\n      superficial tumour are treated by surgery, which is the only curative treatment.  However,\n      about 50% of these patients will relapse, and cannot be cured by local treatment in the\n      majority of cases.  The survival of untreated metastatic patients does not exceed 3 to 6\n      months, and systemic chemotherapy increases overall survival of patients with unresectable\n      disease.\n\n      However, the overall survival of patients with advanced disease treated with chemotherapy\n      remains short (14 months), which reflects a substantial unmet medical need for more\n      effective therapy in this very poor prognosis disease.\n\n      Cabazitaxel is a new taxane, taxanes have demonstrated activity in advanced bladder cancer,\n      and are among the most active new cytotoxic agents to be assessed in transitional cell\n      carcinoma.\n\n      Cabazitaxel has demonstrated activity in cell lines with acquired resistance to doxorubicin,\n      vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.\n\n      This is a randomised, open-label, parallel-group phase 2 study of cabazitaxel versus best\n      supportive care (including chemotherapy).\n\n      The study is divided into three phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up.  The treatment\n      phase comprises a maximum of six three-weekly cycles of therapy, with a post treatment\n      discontinuation visit taking place 3 weeks after last dose of treatment before the follow-up\n      phase begins.\n\n      This phase 2 study will initially recruit 25 patients and after interim analysis will to\n      increase to recruit 96 patients randomised between the two treatment options and the study\n      is expected to last about 2 years."
