A variety of diseases diagnosed during fetal life can put\n      children at risk for cardiac disease. The accurate assessment of cardiac function is\n      important in these patients. A type of imaging scan called \"fetal echocardiogram\" is used to\n      measure the contractility or squeeze of the heart. The fetal echocardiogram is a painless\n      test and completely non-invasive.\n\n      This study aims to recruit women and fetuses to determine if this imaging scan can be used\n      throughout the pregnancy to measure heart squeeze and develop normal values to help doctors\n      better diagnose fetuses who may have cardiac disease before they are born."

A fetal echocardiogram is picture\n      of the unborn baby's heart in motion made by bouncing sound waves off the heart and\n      recording the echo. The procedure will be very similar to the ultrasounds that the subject\n      is already receiving as part of her prenatal care.\n\n      The scans will start at week 20 of the subject's pregnancy and repeat every 3 weeks until\n      week 38 of birth (whichever occurs first). The appointments will last approximately 30\n      minutes each and will be performed by one of two sonographers trained specifically in fetal\n      echocardiography. One additional echocardiogram will be performed on the infant after birth,\n      within the first two months of life. In addition to the scans, study staff will access the\n      subject's medical record to collect information such as: age, ethnicity, race, medical\n      history and health insurance status."
