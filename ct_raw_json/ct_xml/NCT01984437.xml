  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the registry is to gather both retrospective and prospective case data on the
      use of the commercially available Magellan Robotic System and Magellan Robotic Catheters in
      accordance with the approved intended use.  For prospective cases, follow-up patient data
      will be collected at 14 days (± 5 days) postprocedure to assess treatment success, primary
      patency of intended targeted vessel region, and adverse events.

      The data will be analyzed for medical education, societal presentation, and/or publication
      by the investigators.

      Over the next 2+ years, physicians who meet the selection criteria will be invited to
      participate in the registry.

      The objectives of the study are to allow the physician to use the commercially available
      Magellan Robotic System and Magellan Robotic Catheters to navigate to the treatment targets
      in the peripheral vasculature to:

        -  Determine the number of endovascular procedures consecutively performed with the
           Magellan Robotic System to navigate to treatment targets in the peripheral vasculature
           and,

             -  Achieve stable and efficient system preparation and set-up times.

             -  Achieve stable and efficient navigation and cannulation times of target vessels
                during endovascular procedures.

             -  Achieve stable and efficient placement of therapeutic equipment used to perform
                endovascular procedures (guide wires, balloons, stents, etc.).

             -  Achieve stable and reduced fluoroscopy time during the endovascular procedures.

        -  Determine the number of cases required to reach a &quot;steady state,&quot; reduction or
           predictable time in conducting peripheral interventional procedures using descriptive
           (means, ranges) statistics to analyze the data.

      Participation in this registry is open to all facilities with an installed commercially
      available Magellan Robotic System over the next 5 years.  Institutional Review Board
      (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) notification will be provided or approval obtained, as required
      at each participating site.  For sites at which only IRB/EC notification is the requirement
      for participation, written confirmation of IRB/EC receipt of the notification will be
      required and submitted to Hansen Medical prior to patient consent.  Approval notification
      shall also be submitted to Hansen Medical prior to patient consent.

      Design

      This is a prospective and retrospective, multi-center, single arm, non-blinded, sequentially
      enrolling data collection activity (for which Hansen Medical is providing funding).  Only
      patients scheduled to undergo endovascular procedures using the System will be approached
      for enrollment.  Written, informed consent will be obtained (using the current and approved
      informed consent form) from all subjects prior to any registry-related activities being
      performed.  In view of patients having been treated using the Magellan Robotic System while
      this protocol was undergoing preparation, retrospective procedural data (and follow-up data
      if available) also may be collected from patients who provide written, informed consent.  Up
      to 500 patients may be enrolled.

      Methods

      Registry procedures will be conducted in accordance with the labeled indication for use of
      the Magellan™ Robotic System.

      Prior to the physician participating in the registry and prior to subject enrollment, all
      participating physicians will be required to complete Hansen Medical's Magellan Robotic
      System training and become certified in its use with an inanimate anatomical model.
      Additionally, it is recommended that each physician practice 'driving' the System to
      selected vessel targets of the inanimate model for a period of 5 hours, broken up into 30-60
      minute sessions per the physician's schedule convenience.  Finally, the physician possesses
      the endovascular interventional experience to enroll and treat subjects, as described in
      this protocol.

      Participating registry sites must have a commercially available Magellan Robotic System for
      the treatment of patients.

      Data Management

      Participating sites will be assigned a specific site numeric identification code by the
      registry sponsor.

      Case data for submission to the ROVER Registry will not include patient identifiers.
      However, patient participants will be assigned a registry identification code and sites will
      be asked to maintain a &quot;key&quot; log (linking the registry identification code to the specific
      patient identifying information) to facilitate patient identification, in the event it is
      deemed necessary.  The registry sponsor will be blinded to the site &quot;key&quot; log.

      The information collected into the registry will be data related to the procedure in which
      the Magellan System was used or planned to be used and may include patient follow-up data,
      minimally 14 days(± 5 days)post procedure but also may include 30 day follow-up to assess
      for the resolution of a procedural or post procedure adverse event.

      The study data will be submitted to a third-party host of the website (with copies submitted
      to the registry sponsor) after the physician confirms by signature the authenticity and
      accuracy of the data.  The data will be entered into the registry database by the
      third-party website host, employing quality measures to ensure accurate data entry.  The
      third-party website host will assume the responsibility of ensuring the authenticity,
      integrity, and confidentiality of the registry database, including database access and time
      stamped audit trails.

      The database will be a repository for the collected registry data and the data will be made
      available (in extractable format) to the physician participants.  Routine registry reports
      will be generated on a schedule deemed appropriate and based on the volume and frequency of
      data entered.  The reports will be reviewed by the registry sponsor's Clinical Affairs
      Department to ensure that critical data is being reported and to review any data that does
      not appear reasonable or appears erroneous.  Sites may be contacted to provide key data that
      was not originally submitted for the respective case(s) and/or to clarify discrepancies.

      In the event angiographic images are collected for submission to the registry, the images
      will be de-identified.

      Adverse Events

      The data submitted will be reviewed on a regular basis for safety issues and complaints.
      Safety issues will be communicated to Hansen Medical's Quality Affairs (QA) Department to
      ensure adequate post market surveillance of the device.  Complaints will be forwarded to the
      individuals responsible for Product Complaints within Hansen Medical's Quality Assurance
      Department.

      Adverse events and/or complaints deemed reportable will be submitted to the appropriate
      regulatory agency/agencies by Hansen Medical, Inc.
