If QTc\n             exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times\n             and the average of the three QTc values should be used to determine the subject's\n             eligibility.\n\n          -  Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential, including those with\n             tubal ligation.\n\n          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, vitamins and dietary supplements within\n             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study\n             medication. Herbal supplements must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose\n             of study medication. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses\n             of <=1 g/day.
