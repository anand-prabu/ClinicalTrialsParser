Therefore, further\n      studies are urgently needed to find effective and safe treatments.\n\n      Neuroaid is a Traditional Chinese Medicine which has been shown to stimulate growth of brain\n      cells and connections in animals. Neuroaid may improve blood flow in the brain and\n      functional recovery after stroke in patients. Neuroaid-II is a simplified formula with only\n      the main 9 herbal ingredients of the original formula and no animal ingredients.\n\n      The NEURoaid II (MLC 901) assessment in cognitively Impaired not demented subjects: a pilot\n      double blind, placebo-controlled randomized Trial on Efficacy and Safety (NEURITES) Study is\n      a 24-week, early phase trial of Neuroaid-II in patients who have thinking problems after\n      stroke. The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the study drug in improving\n      cognitive performance. The safety of the study drug will be closely monitored using adverse\n      events, laboratory tests and vital signs.\n\n      The trial is important as it aims to set new standards for the scientific evaluation of\n      Asian Traditional Medicine for integration into standard medicine practice. It may\n      potentially establish a novel therapeutic approach for improving cognition after stroke."
