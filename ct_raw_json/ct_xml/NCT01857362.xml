      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence between Orfadin 20 mg and 10 mg
      capsules in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, randomized 2-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects will
      receive single oral 20 mg doses of nitisinone administrated as one 20 mg capsule or as two
      10 mg capsules of Orfadin. There will be a 3-week washout period between the doses.

      There will be a screening visit within 3 weeks prior to the first dose. During each
      treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinic from the afternoon on the day
      before drug administration (i.e., on Day -1) and remain at the clinic until the 48-hour
      post-dose blood sample has been collected in the morning of Day 3. They will then return for
      ambulatory visit in the morning of Day 4 (72-hour sample). A follow-up visit will take place
      7-14 days after the last dose.
