Most patients with advanced NSCLC have significant\n      physical symptoms, but even those who do not have physical symptoms have high levels of\n      anxiety and depression."

The feedback helps patients to understand that deep\n      relaxation is helping their bodies as well as their minds. Several small studies of BFSM\n      training in cancer populations have been successful at helping with side effects of\n      chemotherapy and radiation, but the effects of BFSM on distress and quality of life (QOL),\n      particularly in NSCLC patients, have not been studied."
