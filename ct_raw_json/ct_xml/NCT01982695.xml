  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a double-blind randomized clinical trial of lisinopril versus losartan for the
      treatment of cardiomyopathy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Both drugs are known to be
      effective for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. ACEi have been reported to delay the
      onset and progression of left ventricle dysfunction in children with DMD. Multiple studies
      show therapeutic efficacy of losartan in animals with cardiomyopathy related to muscular
      dystrophy and in patients with cardiomyopathy from diverse causes. ARBs are often reserved
      for patients in whom heart failure is not adequately treated or where side effects preclude
      the use of an ACEi. However, in DMD, losartan might be a better choice as a first line drug
      because of studies demonstrating a potential benefit for skeletal muscle in the mdx mouse.
      Considering that both skeletal and cardiac muscles are major contributors of the disability
      of DMD, a drug that could improve both heart and skeletal muscles simultaneously would need
      consideration as the drug of choice for the cardiomyopathic DMD patient.
