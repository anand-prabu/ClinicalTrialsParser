  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test ways to give women more options and flexibility when they are ending
      their unwanted pregnancies.  The investigators will look at uptake and acceptability of
      using mifepristone outside of the clinic for pregnancy termination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the uptake of mifepristone administration outside of the health
      center for pregnancy termination and its acceptability to women and to their providers.  In
      addition, we plan to evaluate rates of follow-up, adherence, efficacy, complications, days
      of missed work and/or school, and lost income. This will be a prospective, comparative,
      non-randomized, open-label study. All women who are seeking medical abortion will be offered
      participation in the study.  Women who enroll in the study will be given a choice between
      taking the mifepristone outside the center or in the center setting.
