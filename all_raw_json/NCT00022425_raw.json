The use of perillyl alcohol may be effective in preventing the\n      recurrence of breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of perillyl alcohol in preventing the\n      recurrence of breast cancer in women who have been treated with surgery with or without\n      adjuvant therapy."

Treatment continues every 4\n      weeks for 3 courses.\n\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of perillyl alcohol until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which\n      at least 2 of 6 patients experience grade 1 toxicity or at least 1 of 6 patients experience\n      grade 2 or greater toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
