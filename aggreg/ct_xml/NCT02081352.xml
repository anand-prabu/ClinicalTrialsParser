  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to help determine how safe and effective DermaPure™ may be in
      treating hard-to-heal diabetic foot ulcers compared to the current standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DermaPure™ is a decellularized dermal skin substitute using the Tissue Regenix dCELL®
      patented Technology to remove cells and other components from human and animal tissue while
      maintaining the native structural and biomechanical properties. The primary objective of the
      study is to establish the wound healing performance and safety of DermaPure™ over a 12 week
      period, when administered to &quot;hard to heal&quot; chronic, neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers. This
      study has been designed to compare the performance of DermaPure™ (in combination with
      standard care) versus standard care alone.

          -  Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with HbA1c ≤12%

          -  Adequate perfusion

          -  A full thickness chronic, neuropathic diabetic foot plantar ulcer defined by Texas or
             Wagner classification.

          -  Target ulcer decreases in size (surface area) by less than 30% in the 2 week
             screening period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI greater than 45kg/m2.

             debridement.

          -  A clinical diagnosis of an active/acute Charcot neuroarthropathy. Inactive/chronic
             Charcot does not exclude the patient.

          -  Therapy with any investigational agent or drug within 4 weeks preceding the screening
             visit.
