      This is a single arm phase II study of Chlorambucil in combination with subcutaneous
      Rituximab followed by maintenance therapy with subcutaneous Rituximab in patients with
      histologically proven diagnosis of CD20-positive marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type
      arisen at any extranodal site, either de novo, or relapsed following local therapy
      (including surgery, radiotherapy and antibiotics for H. pylori-positive gastric lymphoma).

      The study consists in three parts. In Part A (induction phase I) patients will be treated
      with Chlorambucil 6 mg/m2 daily p.o for 42 consecutive days (weeks 1-6) in combination with
      intravenous Rituximab 375mg/m2 on day 1 week 1 followed by subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg on
      days 8, 15 and 22 (day 1 of weeks 2, 3 and 4). After restaging (CT scan to be performed
      during weeks 7-8, i.e. between d42 and d55), responding patients (CR, CRu, PR) and those
      with stable disease will be treated in part B (induction phase II). In part B, starting from
      d56, (month 3) patients will receive Chlorambucil 6 mg/m2 daily p.o for 14 consecutive days
      (d1-14) every 28 days for 4 cycles in combination with subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg on day
      1 of each 28-day cycle. After restaging (CT scan to be performed at the end of month 6)
      responding patients and those with stable disease will be treated in part C. In Part C
      (maintenance phase) patients will be treated with subcutaneous Rituximab 1400mg every two
      months for 2 years (in total 12 injections). During maintenance phase, CT scans will be
      performed every 12 months and patients responding or with stable disease will stay on
      treatment for a total of two years as above reported.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven diagnosis of CD20-positive marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of
             MALT type either de novo, or relapsed following local therapy (including surgery,
             radiotherapy and antibiotics for H. pylori-positive gastric lymphoma) arisen at any
             extranodal site 1.1 The following patients with gastric MALT Lymphoma can be entered:

               -  H. pylori-negative cases, either de novo (non pre-treated) or at relapse
                  following local therapy (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy or antibiotics).

               -  H. pylori-positive cases at diagnosis, who failed antibiotic therapy, including

                    -  Patients with clinical (endoscopic) and histological evidence of disease
                       progression at any time post H. pylori eradication

                    -  Stable disease with persistent lymphoma at ≥ 1 year post H. pylori
                       eradication

                    -  Relapse (without H. pylori re-infection), after a remission

                    -  Patients who failed either first line antibiotics or further local
                       treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) 1.2 Similar consideration may be
                       applied to patients with ocular adnexal lymphoma treated with antibiotics.

          2. Measurable or evaluable disease. Measurable disease in at least two perpendicular
             dimensions on an imaging scan is defined as: lymph node or nodal mass bi-dimensional
             measurement with &gt; 1.5 cm in longest transverse diameter or the short diameter must
             measure &gt; 10 mm regardless of the longest transverse diameter.

          9. For women of childbearing potential only: negative serum pregnancy test done within 7
             days prior to study drugs administration or within 14 days if with a confirmatory
             urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first study drugs administration

         10. Fertile male or female patients of childbearing potential and their partners must use
             two forms of contraception during the study and for at least 12 months after the last
             dose of subcutaneous rituximab.

             For appropriate methods of contraception considered acceptable, see Appendix C.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner
             are participating in this study and for 12 months after study participation, the
             patient should inform the treating physician immediately.

             Female patients of childbearing potential are defined as follows:

               -  Pre-menopausal women (patients with regular menstruation, patients after
                  menarche with amenorrhea or irregular cycles, patients using a contraceptive
                  method that precludes withdrawal bleeding

               -  Women who have had tubal ligation

             Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the
             following reasons:

               -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
                  salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy

               -  The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period) for 24
                  consecutive months

             addition, if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a
             HBV DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded

         12. Positive serology for hepatitis C (HC) defined as a positive test for HCAb, confirmed
             by HC RIBA immunoblot assay on the same sample.

         15. Fertile men or women of childbearing potential who do not agree to use a highly
             effective measure of contraception (such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine device
             or barrier method of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal jelly or
             surgically sterile) throughout the study and for at least 12 months after the last
