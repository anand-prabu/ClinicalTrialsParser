The trial is carried out in consultation with the World Health\n      Organization, the International Society of Hypertension, the European Society of\n      Hypertension and the World Hypertension League. Syst-Eur is a multicentre trial designed by\n      the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly (EWPHE), to test the\n      hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment of elderly patients with isolated systolic\n      hypertension results in a significant change in stroke morbidity and mortality. Secondary\n      endpoints include cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart\n      failure. To be eligible patients must be at least 60 years old and have a systolic blood\n      pressure averaging 160-219 mmHg with a diastolic pressure less than 95 mmHg. Patients must\n      give their informed consent and be free of major cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular\n      diseases at entry. The patients are randomized to active treatment or placebo. Active\n      treatment consists of nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day), combined with enalapril (5-20 mg/day) and\n      hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day), as necessary. The patients of the control group\n      receive matching placebos. The drugs (or matching placebos) are stepwise titrated and\n      combined in order to reduce systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg at least to a level below 150\n      mmHg. Morbidity and mortality are monitored to enable an intention-to-treat and per-protocol\n      comparison of the outcome in the 2 treatment groups."
