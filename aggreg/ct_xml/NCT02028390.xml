  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test and evaluate how well a medical imaging device that
      takes both visual and thermal pictures of wounds or body surface areas of interest can help
      collect added information about the wounds or body surface areas of interest in a wound
      clinic.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or greater, of either gender and of any ethnic background

          -  Able to tolerate position change(s) and turns for up to 10 minutes comfortably

          -  Have an existing external wound or body surface area of interest:

               -  External wound or body surface area of interest must be in separate body
                  locations (ex: one on the right heel, one on the left heel, and the other on the
                  sacrum)

          -  Have qualifying external wound or body surface area of interest:

               -  External wound or body surface area of interest that fits entirely within the
                  field of view and does not wrap around a body edge

               -  No device or treatment will obscure the external wound or body surface area of
                  interest

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonatal and pediatric patients

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Cannot tolerate position changes for up to 10 minutes comfortably (per external wound
             site imaged)

          -  On therapies or treatments which cannot be safely suspended long enough to conduct an
             imaging session as determined by facility policy

          -  Have a wound dressing or medical device which cannot or should not be removed as
             determined by site investigator

          -  Have an external wound with excessive or heavy exudate that cannot be controlled
             during the imaging session. Excessive drainage can obscure external wound features.

          -  If the patient has a complex external wound:

               -  The external wound wraps around a body edge or otherwise cannot be imaged
                  entirely within the visual field of view.

               -  From visual assessment, the external wound edges are not definable and/or cannot
                  be clearly distinguished from other conditions near external wound (E.g.
                  breakdown or the deterioration of the surrounding body surfaces due to other
                  conditions such as cancer or other types of ulcers makes determining the edge of
                  the external wound impossible).

          -  Have not provided signed informed consent

          -  Non-English speaking

          -  Subjects in isolation
