Currently, pancreatic cancer\n      is diagnosed using CT or MRI scans which miss small pancreatic cancers, particularly early\n      stage disease. Researchers at the University of Virginia have identified a biomarker for\n      pancreatic cancer called plectin, which is very specific for pancreatic cancer and not\n      other, non-cancerous conditions involving the pancreas. These researchers have also\n      developed PTP-01, an  experimental drug that may be used with SPECT imaging to detect\n      pancreatic cancer cells in humans."
