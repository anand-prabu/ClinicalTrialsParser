  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in determining those procedures that prove to be most
      efficient and effective in facilitating continence (i.e., &quot;dry pants&quot; or the absence of
      soiled undergarments), appropriate eliminations (i.e., voids/stools in toilet), and
      independent requests/initiations to use the toilet. To assess the effectiveness of toilet
      training methods (procedures), data on toileting skills (in addition to each skill in a
      given child's curriculum) are collected across the school day (7:30 am-5:45 pm) by the
      classroom teachers.  The primary dependent variables (toileting skills) are continence
      (i.e., absence of soiled undergarments), appropriate eliminations (i.e., the number of
      voids/stools made in the toilet), and independent/self requests (i.e., communication by the
      child with an adult to use the toilet).  The toileting procedures are implemented by
      classroom teachers (undergraduate practicum students) and implementation is monitored by
      classroom supervisors (graduate teaching assistants).  Procedural effectiveness is evaluated
      on a daily basis by the graduate teaching assistants and on an at-least-weekly basis by
      faculty supervisors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the effects of the baseline toileting program are assessed.  Baseline consists of
      prompting the child to use the bathroom approximately every 90 min (or more frequently if
      they independently request to do so).  If the investigators observe low levels of
      continence, appropriate eliminations, and/or independent/self requests, components of the
      program are systematically altered to increase success.  The ultimate goal is for the child
      to remain continent throughout the day, independently request (or initiate) toilet use, and
      appropriately eliminate in the toilet once in the bathroom.  The following procedural
      modifications are made if high levels of success are not observed in baseline:

      The first modification is to change the child's undergarment type.  Specifically, underwear
      will be used, and it's effects will be evaluate to determine what effect (if any) underwear
      has on toileting performance.

      The second modification is to conduct an individualized preference assessment to identify
      types of food and leisure items a given child prefers.  This is done by having the child
      select items from an array (items selected based on direct observations of child and
      parent/teacher report) and allowing him/her access to the chosen item for a brief period of
      time.  This will generate a list of preferred items/activities ranked in order of relative
      preference.  Subsequently, the highest ranked items from the preference assessment will be
      arranged as reinforcers for continence, appropriate eliminations, and self-initiations.  A
      third modification is to combine the above modifications to determine whether a combination
      of toilet training procedures enhances toileting performance (as compare to the
      implementation of individual toilet training procedures).  This modification will be
      conducted while children wear underwear.
