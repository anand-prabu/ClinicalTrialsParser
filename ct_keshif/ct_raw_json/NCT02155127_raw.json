Impairments in physical function and mobility limitations have been reported\n      in older Chronic Kidney Disease patients, however the consequences of impaired functioning\n      on participation in daily life and quality of life have not been studied.  Early\n      identification and interventions to mitigate deterioration in physical function and mobility\n      should lead to improved health and quality of life outcomes in older patients with Chronic\n      Kidney Disease.  Although older individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease have reduced\n      survival expectancy, maintaining physical function and mobility may contribute to longer\n      active life expectancy, and higher quality of life despite their diagnosis."
