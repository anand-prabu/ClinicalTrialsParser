The WM FEV1 was calculated using 0-6 hour post-dose measurements at Day 14 of each TP, which included pre-dose (trough value for Day 14 [mean of the 23 and 24 hour assessments post Day 13 dosing]) and post-dose 15 minutes (min), 30 min, and 1, 3, and 6 hours. BL is the mean FEV1 values recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant. Change from BL for each TP is the Day 14 value minus the BL value for that TP. Participants could have been classified as responders to both UMEC and VI.",

The WM FEV1 was calculated using 0-6 hour post-dose measurements at Day 14 of each TP, which included pre-dose (trough value for Day 14 [mean of the 23 and 24 hour assessments post Day 13 dosing]) and post-dose 15 minutes (min), 30 min, and 1, 3, and 6 hours. BL is the mean FEV1 values recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant. Change from BL for each TP is the Day 14 value minus the BL value for that TP. Participants could have been classified as responders to both UMEC and VI.",

A participant is a reponder to UMEC if they were a responder to UMEC monotherapy or a responder to both UMEC monotherapy and VI monotherapy. A participant is a responder to VI if they were a responder to VI monotherapy or a responder to both UMEC monotherapy or VI monotherapy. BL is the mean FEV1 recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between BL and the mean BL in each treatment period for each participant.

BL is the mean FEV1 values recorded 30 min and 5 min pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant.
