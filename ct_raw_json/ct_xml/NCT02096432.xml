    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop and refine a suicide intervention protocol, and pilot test a
      culturally tailored randomized control trial to reduce suicidal thoughts among U.S. Chinese
      older adults. During the first phase of the study, the investigators plan to invite the
      community advisory board and key stakeholders to participate in the iterative design and
      refinement of the study protocol. During the second phase of the project and after the
      initial screening and based on a specific set of inclusion criteria, the investigators will
      invite U.S. Chinese older adult to participate in a pilot randomized control trial of a
      culturally adapted intervention to reduce the frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts
      in Chinese older adults.  During the third phase of the project, the investigators plan to
      invite pilot intervention participants as well as key stakeholders and health care
      professionals on the cultural acceptability of the pilot intervention. Through the
      achievement of these objectives, the investigators will set the foundation to fully test a
      culturally adapted in-home intervention, which may be particularly suitable for Chinese
      older adults with suicidal thoughts as it addresses cultural-specific barriers and
      integrates care management within existing community services agencies using non-mental
      health professionals, including community health workers.
