There is little knowledge about the course and the risk factors for\n      recurrence of depression among elderly people in Norway. The aim of the PRODE-study is to\n      examine the short- and long-term prognosis of elderly depressed patients who are referred\n      for treatment in departments of old age psychiatry.\n\n      Method: PRODE is a multicentre case-control and longitudinal study of elderly (>60 years)\n      depressed and non-depressed patients with a one and three year follow-up. Nine participating\n      departments of old age psychiatry used the same standardized instruments to collect data of\n      the patients on depression and other mental health issues, cognition, physical health,\n      medications, functions in activities of daily living, quality of life and family carers'\n      situation. The included patients and controls underwent an MRI scan of the brain according\n      to a comprehensive protocol developed for this project. Furthermore, blood and saliva from\n      the included patients are stored in a Biobank for analyses of pro- and anti-inflammatory\n      cytokines and cortisol.\n\n      The study included 169 patients (December 2009-January 2013) and will include the same\n      number of non-depressed controls.\n\n      Outcome Measures (short-term):\n\n        -  Depression as measured with the Montgomary and Aasbergs Depression Rating Scale\n           (MADRS), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) and Hospital Anxiety and\n           Depression Scale (HADS)\n\n        -  Function in activities of daily living\n\n      Outcome measures (long-term):\n\n        -  Cognition as measured by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and diagnosis of\n           dementia.\n\n        -  Depression, recurrence of depression and as measured wtih the MADRS and CSDD.\n\n        -  Use of health care facilities; nursing home.\n\n        -  Mortality\n\n        -  Function in activities of daily living"
