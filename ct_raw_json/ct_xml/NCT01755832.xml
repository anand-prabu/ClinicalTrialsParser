  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of heated pool group exercises for
      patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases with regard to symptoms (pain, fatigue,
      stiffness and ability to carry out daily activities).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients receive text messages on mobile phones twice a week for circa 40 weeks. The
      text messages ask for pain, fatigue, stiffness and ability to carry out everyday activities.
      The patients should respond with a number from 0 to 10, where 0 is no symptoms/no hindering
      of activity and 10 is worst symptoms/worst hindering of activity.
