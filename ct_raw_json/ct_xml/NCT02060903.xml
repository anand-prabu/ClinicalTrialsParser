          6. Has a condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may increase the risk to
             the subject and/or the interpretation of the data.

          7. Has visible skin/scalp condition(s) that are not attributable to head lice
             infestation, such as an erythema score that is &gt;2, blisters, vesicles which, in the
             opinion of the investigative personnel or Sponsor, will interfere with safety and/or
             efficacy evaluations.

          8. Has eczema or atopic dermatitis of skin/scalp.

          9. Has had a prior reaction to NixÂ® or products containing permethrin.
