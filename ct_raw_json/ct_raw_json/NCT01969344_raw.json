Millions of Americans have COPD,\n      and it is the fourth leading cause of death in the country.  The most common cause of COPD\n      is cigarette smoking, although not all smokers get COPD.  The discovery of new treatments\n      for COPD has been slowed by a poor understanding of different types of COPD and a lack of\n      ways to measure whether or not COPD is getting worse.\n\n      The study has two main goals.  The first is to find groups of patients with COPD who share\n      certain characteristics.  Certain groups may respond differently to certain treatments.  The\n      second is to find new ways of measuring whether or not COPD is getting worse.  This would\n      provide new ways of testing whether a new treatment is working."
