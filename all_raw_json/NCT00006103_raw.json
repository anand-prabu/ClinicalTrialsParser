It is not yet known if the effectiveness of irinotecan combined\n      with fluorouracil in treating colorectal cancer varies depending on the patient's racial\n      background.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan combined with fluorouracil\n      in treating patients from different racial backgrounds who have colorectal cancer that is\n      advanced, recurrent, metastatic or has not responded to treatment with fluorouracil."

Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a total of 5 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (100 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3 years."
