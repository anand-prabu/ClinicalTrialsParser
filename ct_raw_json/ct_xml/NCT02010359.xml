    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical trial designed to assess whether fish oil treatments are effective
      in the prevention of obesity-related fat tissue (adipose) inflammation. Specifically it
      addresses the hypothesis that fish oils treatments will reduce signaling by chemokine
      pathways  (fractalkine and MCP-1) important in adipose tissue for the recruitment and
      activation of certain white blood cells (macrophages). The study is a double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial of the fish oil Lovaza from GlaxoSmithKline (omega-3-acid ethyl
      esters; a combination of ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
      acid (DHA)) in obese non-diabetic adults, to determine if Lovaza decreases markers of
      inflammation and macrophage activation in adipose and blood and understand the mechanism by
      which fish oils affect inflammation.
