Insomnia is a frequently co-occurring sleep disorder that adds significant\n      morbidity and is a potential barrier to adherence of OSA treatment.  It is currently unknown\n      if direct treatment of insomnia will enhance outcomes of OSA treatment.  The investigators\n      at the Rush Sleep Disorders Center have developed an approach that combines CBT for insomnia\n      delivered by a psychologist with CPAP therapy managed by a physician.  Building upon\n      preliminary data collected in the clinic, the investigators seek to test the efficacy and\n      mechanisms of this multidisciplinary model against the standard practice of treating OSA\n      using CPAP alone."
