  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if researchers could get the same good results with less
      toxicity by using this new approach.

      We already know that the three drugs bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone given
      together at the same time are effective. Most physicians therefore treat patients with
      multiple myeloma with the 3 drug combination. However, the researchers also know that the
      three drugs given together result in more side effects than when only 2 drugs (bortezomib
      and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone) are given. The researchers believe that
      all patients may not necessarily need the three drugs to have good results. In this study,
      the researchers will first treat your disease with bortezomib and dexamethasone. If the
      disease is not well controlled with these 2 drugs, only then the third drug, lenalidomide,
      will be added. By using this sequential approach we may reach the same good results with
      fewer side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or greater at the time of signing the informed consent document.

             • Patients diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma based on IMWG Diagnostic
             Criteria. According to these criteria, all three of the following must be met

               -  Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow &gt; 10% and/or presence of a biopsy
                  proven plasmacytoma

               -  Monoclonal protein (M-protein) present in the serum and/or urine.

               -  At least one of the following Myeloma-related organ dysfunction:

               -  [C] Calcium elevation in the blood, defined as serum calcium &gt; 10.5 mg/l or

             as multiple fractures or advanced bone disease causing immobilization, renal failure,
             spinal cord compression, or organ compromise due to soft tissue plasmacytoma). If
             immediate therapy with radiation and high-dose steroids (eg, for spinal cord

                  contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent
                  through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, OR agree to completely
                  abstain from heterosexual intercourse

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, OR

               -  Agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse

          -  Patients must be able to provide voluntary written informed consent before
             performance of any study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the
             understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without
             prejudice to future medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after
             curative therapy. Patients who have had prior malignancies within the past 2 years
             but are considered to be &quot;cured&quot; with a low likelihood of recurrence may be eligible
             at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.

          -  Any other medical condition or laboratory evaluation that, in the treating
             physician's or principle investigator's opinion, makes the patient unsuitable to
