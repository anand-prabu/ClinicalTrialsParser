It is not yet\n      known whether standard radiation therapy is more effective than high-dose radiation therapy\n      in treating patients with prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of standard radiation\n      therapy with that of high-dose radiation therapy in treating patients with stage II or stage\n      III prostate cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      prostate-specific antigen, T stage, and Gleason score. Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n      All patients receive neoadjuvant androgen deprivation with luteinizing hormone-releasing\n      hormone agonists every 4 weeks beginning 3-6 months before initiation of radiotherapy and\n      continuing until completion of radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard conformal radiotherapy for 6.5 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo high-dose conformal radiotherapy for 7.5 weeks. Quality of\n           life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study."
