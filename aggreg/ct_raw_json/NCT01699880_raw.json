Patient desaturation is one of the most\n      common complications that may lead to cardiac arrest despite pre-intubation oxygenation.\n      Preoxygenation can be improved by the use of non-invasive ventilation, but this technique\n      can be cumbersome to implement in the context of urgent intubation and more importantly it\n      does not insure oxygenation during intubation. High flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is a\n      technique that has been shown to improve patient oxygenation in the context of acute\n      hypoxemic respiratory failure. It bears the potential to be of clinical benefit in the\n      setting of tracheal intubation in the ICU to ensure patient safety. The purpose of this\n      study is to compare pre- and per-intubation (during intubation) oxygenation with either a\n      conventional high FiO2 oxygen bag reservoir facemask (current standard practice) or high\n      flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (new practice to be implemented in our ICU)."

Whether or not all patients should benefit from high flow nasal cannula oxygen\n      therapy for pre-oxygenation remains unknown. In order to improve quality of care delivered\n      to our patients and in anticipation of a change in our practice, we decided to record\n      prospectively oxygen parameters during and immediately of intubation using a facemask and to\n      compare them with parameters obtained in patients intubated after our change in practice.\n      The change of practice consists in the systematic use of high flow nasal cannula oxygen\n      therapy to ensure pre and during procedure (tracheal intubation)oxygenation."
