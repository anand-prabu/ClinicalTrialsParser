  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is the translaryngeal placement of a tube into the trachea via the
      nose or mouth. Endotracheal tubes must be securely fixed to prevent movement, which may
      result in accidental slippage of the tube into a mainstream bronchus or into the pharynx.
      Hollister Incorporated is assessing the functionality and performance of an endotracheal
      tube securement device.
