Secondary end points are to\n      evaluate toxicities according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4, response rate, progression-free survival\n      and overall survival\n\n      Primary Outcome Measure:\n\n      To determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the the combination regimes (DOS2w) and\n      (DOS3w).\n\n      The investigators have planned to examine 4 dose levels of (DOS2w) and 3 dose levels of\n      (DOS3w).\n\n      Methods:\n\n      This dose-finding study is planned to include a total of 24 patients with advanced\n      gastro-esophageal cancer, adenocarcinoma.\n\n      12 patients will be included in (DOS2w) at four at progressively higher dose levels.\n\n      Chemotherapy will be repeated day 1 every second week to a maximum of nine courses.\n\n      12 patients will be included in (DOS3w) at three progressively higher dose levels.\n\n      Chemotherapy will be repeated day 1 every third week to a maximum of six courses.\n\n      In both (DOS2w) and (DOS3w) dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated after the first\n      course. In case of DLT among one of the three patients during the first course of treatment\n      additional three patients will be added at the respective dose level. Dose escalation is\n      continues if 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience DLT.\n\n      Patients will be evaluated with a ct-scan at baseline and after every three or four cycles\n      to exclude progression and evaluate response. Response is assessed by the investigator\n      according to RECIST version 1.1."
