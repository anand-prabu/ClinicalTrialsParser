            "textblock": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is one of the leading causes of\n      pulmonary hypertension (PH).  Despite the severity of this disease, no established\n      treatments exist for this class of PH.  Nebivolol is a drug used in high blood pressure and\n      heart failure, but not used in patients with PH. Due to some additional properties it\n      possesses, the investigators believe nebivolol will improve disease severity in patients\n      with with PH associated with HFpEF. This project will be a prospective, open-label 18-week\n      clinical study of nebivolol in patients with PH associated with HFpEF.  Patients will be\n      identified in clinic based on echocardiogram (TTE) and right heart catheterization (RHC)\n      results (both part of standard clinical care) indicating PH and HFpEF."
