    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to find out how well cebranopadol is tolerated and how often,
      and which, adverse reactions occur when it is taken every day for a longer period of time.
      In addition information will be collected how cebranopadol affects pain and well-being in
      patients suffering from cancer-related pain.

      The trial consists of 3 phases: Titration Phase, Maintenance Phase, and Follow-Up. The total
      duration of the trial will be approximately 28 weeks for each individual participant,
      including the Follow-up. The participants will receive cebranopadol for a maximum of
      approximately 26 weeks.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is defined as any Adverse Event (AE) that occurred on or after the first intake of cebranopadol. TEAEs will be classified by the investigator as falling into 1 of 3 categories:
Mild: Signs and symptoms that can be easily tolerated. Symptoms can be ignored and disappear when the participant is distracted.
Moderate: Symptoms cause discomfort but are tolerable; they cannot be ignored and affect concentration.
Severe: Symptoms which affect usual daily activity.
For TEAE where the intensity changes over time, the maximum intensity observed during the whole duration of the AE will be documented.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked: &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain on average during the last week.&quot; at some of the visits . They will score their pain intensity on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The scores will be calculated as mean values for all patients for each assessment time point.</description>

    <description>The  outcome of a TEAE will be classified into 1 of the following 6 categories by the investigator, i.e.
Recovered/Resolved.
Recovered/Resolved with sequelae.
Fatal
Recovering/Resolving.
Not recovered/Not resolved.
Unknown (e.g., because the participant is lost to follow-up ).
The relative frequencies for each of the outcome categories will be based on the total number of adverse events.</description>
