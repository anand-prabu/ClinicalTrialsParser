  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test a newly developed individual psychotherapy treatment for
      binge eating disorder in adults.  This treatment is a type of individual psychotherapy
      called Integrative Cognitive-Affective Therapy (ICAT) that focuses on helping people change
      their behaviors, feelings, thoughts about themselves, and relationships.  This new treatment
      is being compared to an existing treatment called Cognitive-Behavior Therapy-Guided Self
      Help (CBTgsh), which focuses on changing behavior patterns through the use of reading and
      homework assignments along with sessions with a therapist.  The primary hypothesis of this
      investigation is that ICAT will be associated with greater reductions in binge eating at end
      of treatment and follow-up compared to CBTgsh.
