Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine, docetaxel, and\n      filgrastim in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent leiomyosarcoma or soft\n      tissue sarcoma that cannot be removed by surgery."

Treatment repeats\n      every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with a partial response may receive 2 additional courses of therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38-82 patients (19-43 with uterine leiomyosarcoma and 19-39\n      with other soft tissue sarcoma) will be accrued for this study."
