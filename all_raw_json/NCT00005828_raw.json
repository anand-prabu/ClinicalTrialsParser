Determine the response rate and\n      response duration in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine whether a decline in\n      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) coincides with evidence of disease regression in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral green tea extract six times daily for 4 months. Patients with\n      a 50% decline in PSA, complete or partial response, or stable disease after 4 months\n      continue treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      with disease progression after 4 months receive no further treatment. Patients are followed\n      every 3 months for 5 years or until disease progression. If disease progression, patients\n      are followed every 6 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5\n      years."
