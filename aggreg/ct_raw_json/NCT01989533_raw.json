            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Vaccines create resistance to disease. This study tests experimental human\n      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines that use an adenovirus as a transporter. Transporters\n      may help vaccines stimulate an immune response against HIV. This means the body works to\n      fight infection. Researchers want to see if different ways of giving the vaccines cause\n      different immune responses. They also want to see if the vaccines    adenovirus is\n      contagious. Adenoviruses cause cold symptoms or mild eye infections.\n\n      Participants cannot get HIV from these vaccines. But they can get the adenovirus, so their\n      entire household and intimate contacts must participate.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To test the safety of experimental HIV vaccines.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy adults 18   49 years old.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine\n           tests.\n\n        -  Participants will receive the vaccine 3 times over 6 months. Each time, they will have\n           a physical exam and blood and urine tests. Samples will be taken from their nose,\n           rectum, and cervix.\n\n        -  Some participants will receive the vaccine by swallowing 11 capsules with water. Clinic\n           staff will observe them for 1 hour.\n\n        -  Some participants will receive the vaccine swabbed in their throat. They will get dose\n           1 at the hospital and stay there for 1 week. They will have medical tests and nose\n           swabs. Doses 2 and 3 will not require a hospital stay.\n\n        -  Participants will have 7 follow-up visits over 6 months, with a physical exam and blood\n           tests. Samples will be taken from their nose, throat, and rectum.\n\n        -  Household and intimate contacts will have 4 clinic visits over 8 months, with a\n           physical exam and blood tests."

            "textblock": "This is a Phase 1, single center, randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the\n      safety and immunogenicity of live, replication-competent recombinant Adenovirus type 4-HIV\n      vaccine regimens. The oral route will also contain a placebo control. The vaccine candidates\n      Ad4-mgag and Ad4-EnvC150 will be formulated as enteric-coated capsules to be delivered\n      orally, and as an aqueous formulation for tonsillar administration. Determining the optimal\n      regimen and route will greatly accelerate investigations of these vectors as HIV vaccine\n      platforms.\n\n      Participants volunteering to receive the vaccine orally will be randomized to 1 of 4\n      treatment arms, and those volunteering to receive the vaccine via the tonsillar route will\n      be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Participants will receive either 1 or both vaccines\n      or placebo, depending on group assignment. The study vaccines will be administrered to\n      participants in 3 rounds of vaccination at 0, 2, and 6 months. Tonsillar vaccine recipients\n      will receive the first vaccine in the NIH Special Clinical Studies Unit or other appropriate\n      unit and be followed on an inpatient basis to allow for respiratory isolation. Beginning 4\n      days after vaccination, participants will be tested daily for respiratory shedding of Ad4 by\n      nasopharyngeal wash. They will be discharged to home with close monitoring on Day 7 or after\n      2 consecutive negative washes, whichever comes first; they may remain on the unit longer if\n      medically necessary. Tonsillar vaccine recipients receiving the second and third rounds of\n      vaccine and oral capsule recipients will be vaccinated and discharged to home.\n\n      In addition to clinical and laboratory monitoring of safety, the principal assessments will\n      be shedding of the viruses in rectal, cervicovaginal, throat, and nasal swabs, and\n      assessment of the antibody (mucosal and systemic) response to the HIV and to the Ad4 virus.\n\n      The candidate vaccines will also be administered to 2 groups of participants who have\n      previously received an unrelated HIV vaccine in another clinical study and/or are Ad4\n      seropositive. The aim for these groups is to explore the boost potential of the enteric\n      coated capsule and aqueous formulations of the Ad4-mgag and Ad4-EnvC150 vaccines when given\n      to subjects who have previously received another HIV vaccine and/or are Ad4 seropositive.\n\n      All participants will be followed for 6 months beyond the final vaccination, for a total of\n      12 months. Household and intimate contacts will also be enrolled and monitored for\n      Adenovirus and HIV antibodies over 8 months."
