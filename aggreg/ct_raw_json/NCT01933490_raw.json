The hypothesis to be tested are 1) pretreatment with aspart insulin\n      will prevent, or at least reduce, the occurrence of hypoglycemia and 2) substitution of\n      fructose for glucose in the test meal will prevent, or at least reduce, the occurrence of\n      hypoglycemia. Plasma glucose and serum insulin will be sampled before and for four hours\n      after the three test conditions. The primary study endpoint will be the occurrence or not of\n      plasma glucose < 60 mg/dL after the test meals. The control meal will be compared to the\n      insulin pre-treated test meal and, in a separate comparison, to the fructose test meal.\n      Secondary endpoints will be comparisons between the control and active treatments in peak\n      postprandial serum insulin, peak postprandial plasma glucose, nadir postprandial plasma\n      glucose, and the 4-hr longitudinal course of plasma glucose measurements."
