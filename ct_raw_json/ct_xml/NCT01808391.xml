  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, historical controlled study. The present clinical study
      will measure non-inferiority of 12 month TLF rate compared to historical control.The
      selected historical control is the Xience V arm from RESOLUTE All-Comer clinical study, that
      study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, two-arm, international, open-label
      study.The historical control did not have angiographic follow up before 12 months, in the
      present clinical study, only subjects with clinical follow-up conducted at 12 months without
      any pre-specified angiographic assessment prior to 12 month clinical follow-up will be part
      of this analysis cohort. Out of the total 1200 patients, 900 patients (clinical follow-up
      cohort) will be included in this analysis cohort.

    <description>Complete passage of the stent across the target lesion with full expansion of the stent to the desired diameter at the desired location.
Note:
Failed delivery: failure to pass the stent through the guiding catheter into the coronary artery,failure to pass it completely across the target lesion, or failure to expand the stent to its desired diameter. Failed delivery includes proximal deployment defined as those instances of failed delivery when the stent could be advanced only partially across the target lesion but was deployed nonetheless by full expansion.</description>
