Neck pain is a health challenge, that can reduce functional level,\n      concentration and operational safety. Physical exercise has shown good efficacy in reducing\n      neck/shoulder pain in other occupational groups in previous studies.\n\n      The Royal Danish Air Force and the University of Southern Denmark, wishes to examine whether\n      specific physical exercise can prevent and reduce neck/shoulder pain within this\n      occupational group.\n\n      Participants in this project will be randomly selected to either a physical exercise group\n      or a reference group.\n\n        -  The physical exercise group will follow a training program targeted neck and shoulder\n           muscles and train 1 hour per week (3 x 20 min) for 26 weeks.\n\n        -  The reference group will continue normal routines, including workout routines. They\n           will later be offered the same training program as the Physical Exercise group provided\n           that training has a positive effect."
