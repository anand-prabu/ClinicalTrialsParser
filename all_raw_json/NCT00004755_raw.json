Patients are stratified by participating institution.\n\n      One group is treated with daily intramuscular injections of glucantime. Patients with less\n      than a complete response on Day 21 continue treatment until lesions heal completely or for a\n      maximum of 60 days.  Patients with progressive disease on Day 40 are removed from study.\n\n      The second group is treated with daily oral allopurinol.  Patients with a partial response\n      on Day 21 continue treatment until lesions heal completely. Patients with stable or\n      progressive disease on Day 21 or unhealed lesions on Day 56 cross to glucantime therapy.\n      Accrual into this group was closed in 6/96.\n\n      The third group receives allopurinol and glucantime.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 9 months, then annually for at least 5 years."
