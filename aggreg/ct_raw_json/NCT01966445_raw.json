Up-regulation of HER3 expression\n      and activity is also associated with resistance to multiple pathway inhibitors. GSK2849330,\n      a monoclonal antibody targeting HER3, is a new agent for subjects whose tumors express HER3.\n      This study is a phase I, first time in human, open-label, dose escalation study. The purpose\n      of this study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD)\n      of GSK2849330 in subjects with advanced HER3-positive solid tumors. The study will be\n      conducted in two parts. Part 1 (Dose-Escalation Phase) will include dose escalation and\n      PK/PD cohorts to evaluate safety, PK, and PD to guide selection of dose regimen(s) for Part\n      2. In Part 2 (Expansion Cohorts), up to 3 cohorts will be enrolled at the dose regimen(s)\n      selected based on Part 1 data, to evaluate safety in a larger cohort of subjects at the\n      recommended dose regimen and also to evaluate preliminary evidence of clinical benefit."
