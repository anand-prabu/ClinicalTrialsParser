The prevalence of osteoarthritis of the\n      knee has significantly elevated in the elderly population and youth due to age and sport\n      activities respectively. Our aims to treat the knee osteoarthritis are including; reduce\n      knee pain and improve its function; return patients to normal daily activities and reduce\n      health care costs.\n\n      The current treatments which are already being used for osteoarthritis of the knee patients\n      include:\n\n        1. Symptomatic therapy: conservative therapies, physiotherapy, analgesics and\n           non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n        2. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid.\n\n        3. Current Surgical Therapy: knee arthroplasty, osteotomy, arthrodesis and debridement.\n\n      As the low mitotic activity and lack of blood supply cause little ability for the articular\n      cartilage to repair itself, so injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has recently received\n      much more attention due to its capacity to do self-healing in treatment of osteoarthritis of\n      the knee.\n\n      PRP consists of several concentrated growth factors in platelets of autologous blood that\n      are applied to the different parts of medicine such as reconstruction of damaged tissue.\n      Although platelets are well-known to involve in the blood clots formation, but current\n      studies have shown that they secrete many bio-proteins which attract macrophages,\n      mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts to remove necrotic tissue in addition to participate\n      in healing procedure.\n\n      This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to assess The positive effects of\n      platelet-rich plasma injection in 244 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee"
