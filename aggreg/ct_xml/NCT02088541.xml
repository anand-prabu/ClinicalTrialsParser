    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study of the SINE Selinexor given
      orally versus specified investigator choices (one of three potential salvage therapies).
      Patients age ≥ 60 years with relapsed/refractory AML of any type except for AML M3, after
      one prior therapy only, who have never undergone and who are not currently eligible for stem
      cell transplantation and are currently deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy.

      This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study of the SINE Selinexor given
      orally versus restricted investigator choice (i.e., one of three potential salvage
      therapies).

      Patients who have never been transplant eligible, are currently deemed unfit for intensive
      chemotherapy, ≥ 60 years old, who have AML (except Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia:  APL, AML
      M3) after one prior treatment of either hypomethylating agent or a regimen including Ara-C,
      and are meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either
      oral Selinexor or physician's choice (one of three potential treatments: best supportive
      care (BSC) alone, or BSC + hypomethylating agent, or BSC + low dose Ara-C until disease
      progression, death or intolerance has occurred.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 60 years with relapsed/refractory AML of any type except for AML M3, after 1
             prior therapy only, who have never undergone, and who are not currently eligible for,
             stem cell transplantation, and are currently deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy.

          -  ECOG ≤ 2.

          -  Must have available archival or recently acquired bone marrow biopsy/aspiration or
             tumor tissue for central review to be eligible.

          -  Relapsed or refractory AML, defined as either: recurrence of disease after a complete
             remission (CR), or failure to achieve CR with initial therapy.

          -  Must have received only 1 prior line of therapy given at standard doses.  Prior
             therapy must have included: (1) A regimen including cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C)
             chemotherapy (low dose AraC alone does qualify for prior chemotherapy) or (2) a
             hypomethylating agent.

          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the last anti-leukemia treatment (with the
             exception of hydroxyurea) before first dose in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 3 weeks prior to first dose in this
             study.

          -  Presence of central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.

          -  In blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).  Prior myelodysplastic
             syndrome (MDS) is acceptable; prior treatment for MDS does not count as an AML
             therapy.

          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks of first dose of study drug.  Patients must have
             recovered from the effects of any surgery performed greater than 2 weeks previously.

          -  Concurrent active malignancy under treatment.

          -  Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or C virus (HCV) infection; or known to be
             positive for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or HBsAg (HBV surface antigen).

          -  Known HIV infection.

          -  Unable to swallow tablets, or patients with malabsorption syndrome, or any other
             disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function.
