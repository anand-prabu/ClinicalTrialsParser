On the morning of\n      dosing for each of the 2 study periods, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 4 mg\n      fruquintinib in either the fasted or fed state. Subjects will remain at the CRU for at least\n      120 hours after administration of study drug for collection of serial blood samples for\n      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and safety monitoring. Subjects will return to the CRU for\n      safety assessment for up to 336 hours postdose."
