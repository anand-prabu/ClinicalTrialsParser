The primary\n      outcome of ASPREE is defined as prolongation of \"disability-free life\", measured as survival\n      without physical disability or dementia.  At present, the primary purpose of ACES is to: 1)\n      collect information about participant cancer screenings, cancer diagnosis, and family\n      history of cancer and to 2) establish a biologic specimen repository (biobank) for DNA and\n      tumor tissue, and urine from the ASPREE large healthy aging population in the US and\n      Australia for future use by ASPREE, NIA and NCI investigators, and academicians from the\n      broader research community.  At a time in the future and under separate application, the\n      stored blood or saliva, urine, and tumor tissue, together with other information obtained\n      about these participants (in relation to their health, lifestyle and other circumstances)\n      will be analyzed to address specific questions regarding the association of biomarkers and\n      major health outcomes including cancer."

Based on NIAs discretion, select US sites may be recruiting Caucasians\n             70 and older or 75 and older.\n\n          2. Exclusion criteria: (please see www.ASPREE.org for more detailed list of exclusion\n             criteria) i. History of diagnosed dementia or score < 78 on the Modified Mini Mental\n             State Exam at the second pre-randomization (baseline) visit.\n\n             ii. Disability, defined as dependence in one or more Katz activity of daily living.\n\n             iii. Cardiovascular events, intercurrent illness likely to cause death within the\n             next 5 years, a current or recurrent condition with a high risk of major bleeding,\n             e.g. cerebral aneurysm, cerebral AV malformation, any bleeding diathesis, recent\n             peptic ulcer and liver disease.\n\n             iv. Anemia, i.e. hemoglobin level below the normal value (males: 12 g/dL, females: 11\n             g/dL).\n\n          3. Participants eligible for the ASPREE Cancer Endpoints Study (ACES) include any\n             participants recruited into the parent ASPREE study in the United States and\n             Australia. ACES participants will be asked to consent to:\n\n        i. Collection and storage of blood or saliva DNA samples and urine and data for future\n        use.
