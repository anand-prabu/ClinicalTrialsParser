            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland. Few people who\n      develop this disease live more than 5 years after being diagnosed. Those whose tumors have\n      spread inside their abdomen may have an especially poor outcome. In these cases, traditional\n      chemotherapy is not very effective. One possible new treatment is aggressive surgery with\n      heated chemotherapy. This type of treatment has been more effective for other types of\n      cancer in the abdomen. Researchers want to see this if approach can improve the outcomes of\n      people with ACC.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the safety and effectiveness of surgery and heated chemotherapy for ACC.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced ACC.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples\n           will be collected. Heart function tests will be given. Imaging studies will be used to\n           locate the surgical sites before the operation.\n\n        -  Participants will have surgery to remove ACC tumor tissue. After the tumors have been\n           removed, they will have heated chemotherapy with cisplatin. The heat may help weaken\n           any remaining cancer cells and make them easier to destroy. It will also focus the\n           treatment on the tumor sites, rather than the whole body.\n\n        -  Participants will recover in the hospital for several days after surgery. They will\n           have regular follow-up visits to monitor the outcome of the surgery."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor with an incidence of 1.5 to 2 per\n\n      million people per year and has a very poor prognosis with an overall 5-year mortality\n\n      rate of 75 - 90% and an average survival from the time of diagnosis of 14.5 months.\n\n      - The treatment of choice for a localized primary or recurrent tumor is surgical\n\n      resection. For unresectable metastatic or recurrent disease, mitotane,\n\n      aminoglutethimide, metapyrone, and ketoconazole are used.\n\n      - Cisplatin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents for ACC. In the\n\n      Surgery Branch we have conducted Phase I and II trials using heated intraperitoneal\n\n      (IP) chemotherapy with cisplatin for primary peritoneal mesothelioma, low grade\n\n      appendiceal adenocarcinoma, ovarian malignancies, and high grade adenocarcinoma\n\n      of the gastrointestinal tract. Synergy has been demonstrated for cisplatin and\n\n      hyperthermia\n\n      - The purpose of this trial is to determine if an aggressive surgical approach with\n\n      intraperitoneal administration of heated cisplatin when tumor volume is minimal, can\n\n      impact and improve on progression free survival.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To determine IP progression free survival after optimal debulking and heated IP\n\n      chemotherapy with cisplatin in patients with IP spread of adrenocortical cancer\n\n        -  Determine morbidity of this procedure in this patient population\n\n        -  Determine the impact of surgery and HIPEC on QOL and hormone excess\n\n        -  Examine patterns of recurrence (local versus systemic)\n\n        -  Perform molecular analyses to try to discern if there are intrinsic differences between\n\n      tumors that recur widely throughout the peritoneal surface and those that metastasize\n\n      to other organs or are confined to a local recurrence.\n\n      - Determine overall survival after optimal debulking and heated IP chemotherapy with\n\n      cisplatin in patients with IP spread of adrenocortical cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Histologically proven ACC evalauable by CT imaging with the majority of disease\n\n      confined to the peritoneal cavity and surgically resectable to a residual size of less\n\n      than 1 cm or amenable to radiofrequency ablation in patients who are >  18 years of\n\n      age.\n\n      Design:\n\n      - This is a classic phase 2 trial to determine efficacy of this therapeutic strategy in\n\n      ACC. Patients will undergo cytoreductive surgery to achieve a CCR of 0 or 1.\n\n      Patients who are successfully debulked will then undergo HIPEC with cisplatin.\n\n      Patients will be evaluated by associate investigators in coordination with the Principal\n\n      Investigator for eligibility. Due to its exploratory nature, up to 30 patients may be\n\n      enrolled to obtain 24 evaluable patients. (Patients must undergo successful debulking\n\n      and HIPEC to be considered evaluable.)"
