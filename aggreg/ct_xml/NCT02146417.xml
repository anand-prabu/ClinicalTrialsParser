  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As both patients with end-stage kidney disease and society benefit tremendously from live
      kidney donation, the safety and well-being of kidney donors are highly important objectives
      in live kidney donation. Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy has several advantages over open
      nephrectomy, such as less post-operative pain, better quality of life and shorter hospital
      stay. Therefore, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy is nowadays the treatment of choice in most
      countries.

      So far, modifications of the technique of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, i.e. hand-assisted
      and/or retroperitoneoscopic approaches, did not show a significant benefit with regard to
      safety as reflected by the conversion to open and postoperative complications rate. We
      therefore believe that further research should focus on the optimization of early
      postoperative pain and its concomitant use of opioids. Since non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs are contra-indicated before and after nephrectomy, the management of postoperative
      pain largely depends on the administration of opioids. Measures to reduce postoperative pain
      would also reduce the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomitus, and postoperative
      bowel dysfunction.

      A recent pilot study performed by our group showed that the use of low pressure
      pneumoperitoneum was feasible and significantly reduced deep intra-abdominal and referred
      pain score during the first 72 hours after surgery. Previous studies performed by others
      show that low pressure pneumoperitoneum is associated with reduction of systemic
      inflammatory response, post-operative pain and analgesic consumption. Martini et al have
      shown that deep neuromuscular block improves surgical conditions during laparoscopic surgery
      with standard intra-abdominal pressure. To facilitate the use of low pressure
      pneumoperitoneum, deep neuromuscular block improves surgical conditions and might become a
      prerequisite for the use of low pressure pneumoperitoneum.

      Our hypothesis is that the combination of low pressure pneumoperitoneum and deep
      neuromuscular block improves quality of recovery in the early post-operative phase.
