    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, comparison, open-label, phase IV study in kidney
      trasnplant recepients whose immunosupressive regimen is convertied from Cyclosporine with
      corticosterod to  Advagraf ® with corticosteroid.  The eligible patients will be randomized
      into either Arm 1 or Arm 2. The Arm 1 will be reduced corticosteroid slowly until 50% lower
      dose  from 4 weeks to 12 weeks in the Advagraf ®-based immunosuppressive regimen, and the
      Arm 2 will receive the same corticosteroid dose for 24 weeks with Advagraf ®.

      The primary objective is to assess the changes in the GFR after 24 weeks of treatment
      between the group that was reduced corticosteroid slowly until 50% lower dose from 4 weeks
      to 12 weeks and the group with maintained corticosteroid in stable kidney transplant
      subjects whose regimen was converted from a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen with
      corticosteroid to an Advagraf®-based immunosuppressive regimen with corticosteroid for
      kidney transplant subjects whose regimen was converted from a CyA-based immunosuppressive
      regimen.

      The secondary objective is to assess the creatinine clearance rate, acute rejection,
      satisfaction of medication and safety of the group with a 50% reduced dose of corticosteroid
      and the group in which the Advagraf ®-based immunosuppressive regimen with maintained
      corticosteroid.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Had a kidney transplant at least 12 months before his/her enrollment in this
             study(including a kidney retransplantion)

          -  Underwent a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen since his/her last transplantation.
             The CyA dose remained unchanged during the last four weeks before the subject's
             enrollment.

          -  The immunosuppressive regimen (combination of medications) remained unchanged for a
             minimum of four weeks before the subject's enrollment.

             study, or had an acute rejection episode within 24 weeks before his/her  enrollment
             in this study that required anti-lymphocyte antibody therapy

          -  Had been diagnosed with new-onset malignancy after his/her transplantation, except
             for basocellular or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that had been treated
