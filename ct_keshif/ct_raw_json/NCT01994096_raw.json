It is known that in critically ill patients, alterations in\n      function of various organs and body systems can influence the pharmacokinetics and hence the\n      plasma concentration of a drug. A study of caspofungin in ICU patients has found a high\n      inter- and intra-individual variability in caspofungin concentration. Factors that caused\n      subtherapeutic caspofungin plasma concentrations were body weight > 75 kg and\n      hypoalbuminemia. Furthermore, an efficacy study showed a lower response rate for caspofungin\n      among patients with a higher disease severity score.\n\n      As a result of the altered pharmacokinetics, under- or over-exposure of caspofungin can\n      occur in critically ill patients and an adjusted dosage might be necessary in these\n      patients."
