  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary total knee or total hip replacement surgeries are costly high volume procedures &amp;
      outcomes may be affected by surgical &amp; care processes &amp; individual patient characteristics.
      The primary hypotheses is that non compliance with recommended practice impacts patient
      outcomes (e.g. the likelihood of complications following surgery). The primary aims of the
      study are to evaluate the links between processes &amp; outcomes &amp; if possible develop a model
      that will improve patient outcomes &amp; reduce unnecessary practice variation whilst
      considering costs.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim of the study is to identify whether compliance with specific processes is
      associated with better outcomes.

      The study is a longitudinal cohort study to examine outcomes after total hip and knee
      replacement surgeries. We hypothesise the site and patient level compliance is related to
      the prevalence of a subsequent complication (composite outcome comprising 30 day mortality,
      readmission, reoperation or surgical complication).

      METHODS This study will select high volume (&gt;275 cases annually) public and private
      hospitals across Australia.  By involving public and private sites across Australia, the
      generalisability of the findings is enhanced. Each site will identify a site coordinator to
      oversee and manage the project at that site. Site coordinators are identified by each site.
      After hospital discharge, patients are followed up by the investigators.

      This is a prospective observational study with projected sample of c.2200 consenting
      patients from up to 20 high volume hospitals. The site coordinator will screen, approach and
      consent eligible patients during routine preadmission processes. At the time of consent, the
      patient will be required to: provide socio-demographic details about themselves, past
      medical history, complete 2 standard patient reported outcome measures. Contact with
      patients about the study will be made by the site coordinator and routine hospital staff
      involved in their acute care.  Acute data collection will involve prospective audit of
      medical records to collect peri- and post- operative acute care process data, client
      characteristics and outcomes by staff at each site. Random and convenience sampling will be
      used to identify eligible hospital sites which will remain anonymous.

      Patient follow up regarding longer term outcomes will be completed via telephone by study
      investigators at three additional time points (approximately 35 and 90 days and 1 year post
      surgery) to collect repeat data  as provided by each patient at the time of consent.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to profile site level and patient level compliance with
      key processes of care. Multivariable logistic regression (MLoR) will be used to identify the
      association between the binary composite outcome measure and patient level compliance. Site
      and individual patient compliance with evidence based guidelines (where available) or best
      practice recommendations on key processes and relevant outcomes will be examined (e.g.
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention). Sample size calculations have been completed to
      ensure the analyses have sufficient power. If a useful association between processes and
      outcomes is identified, cost analyses with specific foci will be undertaken to consider
      costs for different factors and stages (e.g. acute / post discharge). Secondary analysis
      will determine the predictors of patient -reported outcomes. Depending on the results of
      initial data analyses, additional secondary analyses will potentially include analyses at
      additional time points (beyond initial 35 days) for association between key processes and
      outcomes,  and analysis looking at the association between specific complications and
      compliance with specific processes.

      Interim analysis will be undertaken to assess the level of observed compliance with key
      processes.

      Site survey Prior to study commencement at each site, the site coordinators will complete a
      survey detailing each surgeons protocols for key processes including their VTE and
      antimicrobial prophylaxes. The extent surgeon protocols align with Australian practice
      guidelines will be ascertained.
