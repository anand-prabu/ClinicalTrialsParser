  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or
      bad enzalutamide has on the patient and the cancer. All patients who enter the study will be
      closely monitored for side-effects. If multiple patients develop significant side effects
      from enzalutamide, the study may be stopped early.

      Enzalutamide is an androgen-receptor inhibitor, which means that it blocks the activity of
      the hormone testosterone. In ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers that
      express the androgen receptor, blocking the androgen-receptor may possibly slow or stop
      tumor growth. Enzalutamide has been studied in women with breast cancer, but this is the
      first study using enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal
             carcinoma. Histologic documentation of the original primary tumor is required via the
             pathology report

          -  AR expression ≥10% by IHC

          -  Patients with the following histologic cell types are eligible: serous
             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma,
             undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial
             adenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, malignant Brenner's tumor, or
             adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified

          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Measurable disease is defined as at
             least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension. Each
             lesion must be ≥10mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical
             exam; or ≥ 20mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15mm in short
             axis when measured by CT or MRI

          -  Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for
             management of primary disease

          -  Patients may have received, but are not required to have received, one or two
             additional cytotoxic regimens for management of recurrent or persistent disease

          -  Patients who have received only one prior cytotoxic regimen (platinum-based regimen
             management of primary disease), must have a platinum-free interval of less than 12
             months, or have progressed during platinum-based therapy, or have persistent disease
             after a platinum-based therapy

          -  Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, non-cytotoxic
             therapy (such as bevacizumab) as part of their primary treatment regimen.

             therapy for management of recurrent or persistent disease
