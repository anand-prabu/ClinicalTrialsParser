  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serious concern about the role of anesthesia in tumor recurrence has considerably risen over
      years, but the lack of surrogate markers for tumor spreading made trials addressing this
      issue difficult to realize. However, CTC positivity in breast cancer patients has been
      recently recognized as an independent prognostic factor and proposed as an early indicator
      for therapy response. In this respect, we postulated that changes in the proportion of
      CTC-positive patients before and after general anesthesia would help to determine the effect
      of anesthesia on tumor recurrence.
