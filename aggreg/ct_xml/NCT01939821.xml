  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning to do a cluster randomized trial to test the effect of
      different educational programs for staff according to nursing home patients FI (fecal
      incontinence). Since there are very few published trials of treatment of FI in older people,
      and no rigorously evaluated studies on interventions for FI in nursing homes, or rigorously
      evaluated continence education program for staff concerning continence care, a pilot study
      is necessary. The aim for the pilot study is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and
      adherence according to the educational intervention, methods used and outcome measures. This
      is designed to be an external pilot study. External pilot studies are small scale versions
      of the main study which are not intended to be part of the main study. The pilot
      intervention period is 3 month.
