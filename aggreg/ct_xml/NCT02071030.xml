  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Cone Beam
      Computed Tomography (CBCT) compared to panoramic radiography prior to removal of third
      molars in reducing patient's morbidity. Adults having a close relationship between the
      mandibular canal and one or both lower third molars, as diagnosed from digital panoramic
      radiographs will be recruited for this randomised controlled trial. In one trial arm,
      patients will receive the standard digital panoramic radiograph prior to third molar
      surgery. In the second arm, subjects will undergo an additional Cone Beam Computed
      Tomography (CBCT) prior to third molar surgery.

      All patients require a postoperative visit one week after surgery to assess the outcome.
