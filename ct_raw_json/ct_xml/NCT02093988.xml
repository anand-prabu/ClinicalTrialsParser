      Topical: Administration of medication directly at location where desired (Ex. surgical
      site). Local Intravenous (IV): Administration of medication into a vein (goes to whole
      body). Systemic

      Blood loss during major paediatric spine surgery is significant, and it is well established
      that patients undergoing such surgery have a substantial risk for requiring a blood
      transfusion immediately after surgery. Given the cost and associated risks with foreign
      blood product transfusion, a significant effort has been directed towards reducing
      transfusion requirements through various methods of blood conservation.

      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic antifibrinolytic that functions through competitive
      blockade of the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen, plasmin, and tissue plasminogen
      activator resulting in the inhibition of fibrinolysis and clot degradation (see schematic
      below). When used through intravenous method (IV), it has been shown to safe, efficacious,
      and effective in reducing transfusion requirements and blood loss during immediate period
      after surgery of various orthopaedic procedures, including major surgeries of the spine. A
      growing body of evidence has supported the topical application of TXA in lower extremity
      joint reconstruction, among other procedures, in which a salt water solution containing TXA
      is placed directly in the surgical incision prior to closure (i.e. topical administration).
      The reason for the use of TXA topically arises from reports of blood clotting events thought
      to be attributable to IV administration of TXA. Although these potentially catastrophic
      events are rare, interest in using TXA topically has grown based on evidence demonstrating
      less than one-tenth the serum concentrations of TXA with topical application as compared IV
      dosing.
