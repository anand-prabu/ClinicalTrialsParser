  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis keeps patients with renal failure alive but does not restore normal health.
      Retention of chemicals that bind to plasma proteins and are therefore poorly removed by
      dialysis may contribute to ill health in patients receiving conventional treatment.  This
      proposal will test the effect of a new method designed to improve the removal of
      protein-bound solutes during dialysis.  The effects on blood chemical levels of two
      different dialysis prescriptions will be tested in patients already undergoing nocturnal
      in-center hemodialysis three times weekly.
