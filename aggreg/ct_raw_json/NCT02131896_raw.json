Controlled nutritional diet, as introduced by the professional committees\n      aims at achieving better general health condition.\n\n      There is a growing body of evidence showing that Mediterranean diet has a major role in\n      prevention of diabetes sequelae in type 2 diabetes patients. Hitherto, the effects of\n      Mediterranean diet on patients with type 1 diabetes has not been studied, with the exception\n      of one Italian study.\n\n      Six months after education to consume Mediterranean diet in a cohort of 96 children with\n      type 1 diabetes the authors observed decreased fat and cholesterol consumption, increased\n      dietary fiber consumption, lower LDL cholesterol levels and better HDL to LDL cholesterol\n      ratio.\n\n      The proposed study is aimed to assess the impact of Mediterranean nutrition compared to the\n      accepted nutritional guidelines, in newly diagnosed type 1 children and adolescents on lipid\n      profile, metabolic control, C peptide, daily insulin dose, Inflammatory parameters,\n      endothelial function and anthropometric parameters  12 months following diagnosis.\n\n      The study designed as a two parallel arms, randomized, single center, intervention study.\n\n      Patients enrolled to the study will be randomly assigned, to one of the following groups in\n      a 1:1 ratio. Interventional Arm: Patients assigned to the interventional arm will receive\n      nutritional instructions of Mediterranean diet  and Control Group: Patients assigned to the\n      interventional arm will receive regular nutritional instructions in accordance with the\n      accepted nutritional guidelines"
