The 3 month time point was chosen to allow for\n      the switch to everolimus to occur at a period of stable post transplant liver function when\n      both technical and rejection risks are lower.  The 3 month cut off was also chosen because\n      of data indicating that worsening renal function at 4 weeks, 3 months and 1 year post\n      transplant is an independent risk factor for the development of chronic renal failure and\n      end stage renal disease after orthotopic liver transplantation. 24 patients will be\n      randomized into 2 arms:\n\n      Arm A:  Conversion to Everolimus immunosuppression combined with mycophenolic acid\n      (Myfortic: MPA), and complete discontinuation of Calcineurin inhibitor at 3 months post\n      transplant.\n\n      Arm B:  Continuation with standard immunosuppressive therapy consisting of Calcineurin\n      inhibitor associated with mycophenolic acid (Myfortic: MPA).\n\n      Follow up: 2 years."
