Compare the anti-tumor efficacy of two treatment schedules of lurtotecan\n      liposome, in terms of clinical/radiological response and CA125 tumor marker, in patients\n      with previously treated advanced or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Compare the\n      safety, pharmacokinetics, and possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships of\n      these treatment schedules in these patients. III. Compare the time to progression in\n      patients treated with these treatment schedules.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to time\n      from last prior chemotherapy (less than 6 months vs 6 months or more) and number of prior\n      chemotherapy regimens (1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:\n      Patients receive lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Arm II: Patients\n      receive lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete\n      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after documented CR. Patients achieving partial\n      response (PR) receive 4 additional courses after documented PR or until disease progression\n      at investigator's discretion. Patients with stable disease continue therapy for a maximum of\n      6 courses. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until disease relapse or\n      progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-74 patients (20-37 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 10 months."
