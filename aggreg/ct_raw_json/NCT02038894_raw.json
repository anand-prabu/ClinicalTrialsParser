One\n      anesthetic technique involves the use of general anesthesia with the placement of an\n      endotracheal tube, and maintenance with an inhalation agent, such as sevoflurane (IS). These\n      patients may be extubated under deep anesthesia in the operating room, and allowed to awaken\n      in the post anesthesia care unit. A similar technique involves the placement of an\n      endotracheal tube, and anesthetic maintenance with a continuous infusion of propofol (IP).\n      These patients are also extubated under deep anesthesia in the operating room, and allowed\n      to awaken in the postoperative care unit. The third technique does not use an endotracheal\n      tube and anesthetic maintenance occurs with continuous infusion of propofol with the patient\n      breathing oxygen through their natural airway (NA). Our objective in this study is to\n      compare outcomes between these three established anesthetic techniques.\n\n      Children in the study will be recruited from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center\n      Operating Room Schedule. They will be cared for in the Operating Rooms and Post Anesthesia\n      Care Unit."
