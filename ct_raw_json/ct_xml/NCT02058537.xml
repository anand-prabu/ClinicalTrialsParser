  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals of this study are to ease the symptoms of patients with Eosinophilic
      Esophagitis (EoE) and to test the effectiveness of the drug bethanechol in relieving those
      symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline high resolution esophageal manometry with impedance to Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 7</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The high resolution esophageal manometry with impedance involves a thin, pressure-sensitive tube that is passed through the nose and into the stomach. Once in place, the tube is pulled slowly back into the esophagus (food pipe). When the tube is in the esophagus, the patient is asked to swallow several times while swallowing water, applesauce, crackers, and marshmallows. These swallows will be completed while laying down, sitting upright, and standing. The pressure of the muscle contractions will be measured along several sections of the tube. The tube is removed after the tests are completed. This test allows for a quantitative measure of the pressure in the esophagus that can be correlated to difficulty or ease of bolus swallowing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline evaluation of esophageal function questionnaire to Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 7</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This questionnaire allows the patient to assess their own symptoms and report their opinions about drug effectiveness.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline composite vital signs to Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 7</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Vital signs include temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure. This variables will be measured during the study in order to assess any negative systemic effects of the study drug. These measurements are assessed as a composite and not individually therefore are grouped together as one outcome measure.</description>
