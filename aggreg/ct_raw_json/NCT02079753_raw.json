This study\n      was designed to compare oxygen saturation and patient satisfaction with a portable oxygen\n      concentrator or with a combined system consisting of a fixed device with continuous flow\n      oxygen dispensation and a portable device with pulse dispensation for ambulation.\n\n      Methods: This cross-over trial assessed 25 patients with COPD (92% men; mean age 72.2 \u00b1 7.4\n      years; mean FEV 34.14 \u00b1 12.51%) at four hospitals in Madrid. All patients had previously\n      used the combined system, consisting of a fixed oxygenation system and a portable system for\n      ambulation, with 16 (64%) using stationary and portable concentrators and 9 (36%) using a\n      stationary reservoir and portable liquid oxygen bag. Oxygenation settings at rest and while\n      walking were determined at baseline. Patients were maintained on the previous combined\n      system for one week and then switched to the portable oxygen concentrator for one week. Mean\n      SpO2 over 24 hours was calculated by the software in the oximeter, and compliance was\n      monitored"
