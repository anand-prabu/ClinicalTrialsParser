It is not yet known whether caspofungin acetate or\n      amphotericin B liposomal is more effective for treating these side effects.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of caspofungin acetate with\n      that of amphotericin B liposomal in treating patients who have persistent fever and\n      neutropenia after receiving anticancer therapy."

Patients\n      are stratified according to high-risk (prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior\n      chemotherapy for relapse of acute leukemia) vs low-risk and prior prophylactic antifungal\n      therapy during chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive caspofungin acetate IV over 1 hour followed by placebo IV over\n           2 hours.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo IV over 1 hour followed by amphotericin B liposomal IV\n           over 2 hours.\n\n      Treatment repeats daily for up to 28 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 7 and 14 days after study drug discontinuation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1060 patients (530 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
