    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the incidence of acute grade 2 GI toxicity in the Control 3-D
      Conformal Radiotherapy compared to the Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) arm for
      locally advanced rectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-operative radiotherapy (RT) or chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) is internationally accepted as
      standard practice in the management of locally advanced rectal cancer.

      Multiple randomised trials have proved pre-operative CRT and RT, compared to surgery alone,
      reduce local recurrence, even prior to optimal surgery, and may improve survival for T3
      circumferential resection margin (CRM) negative patients.

      This study aims to determine if  3-DCRT or IMRT result in lower incidence of grade 2 GI
      toxicities.

      Acute toxicities will be assessed weekly during radiotherapy, and at 2 and 4 week post
      treatment.

      Late toxicities will be assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months post treatment, and annually
      to 10 years.
