The intervention protocol\n      consists of a scheduled fluid regimen, early blood culture and antibiotics, and dopamine and\n      blood transfusion when necessary. It is hypothesized that the protocol will significantly\n      decrease in-hospital mortality in patients with severe sepsis and hypotension."

In sub-Saharan Africa, simple therapies such as IV\n      fluids and early antibiotics are frequently under-utilized. Studies of fluid interventions\n      in the region, however, have demonstrated conflicting results. Outcomes in septic patients\n      may be further affected by delays in the diagnosis of tuberculosis-associated severe sepsis.\n\n      The aims of this study are (1) To assess the impact on survival of a simple evidence-based\n      protocol for severe sepsis with hypotensionor septic shock, (2) To evaluate the cost of\n      implementation for a simplified severe sepsis protocol, (3) To develop a clinical diagnostic\n      score for identifying tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis, and (4) To\n      assess the performance of the Xpert TB/RIF rapid PCR system and urine lipoarabinomannan\n      assay for diagnosing tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis."
