Two passes will be performed with the pipelle catheter.  For each pass the catheter will be rotated and scraped 4 times, once in each quadrant."

Unfortunately, few treatments exist\n      except for the use of a gestational carrier.  There have been a number of recent clinical\n      studies demonstrating that local injury to the endometrium results in improved clinical\n      pregnancy outcomes for patients with a history of implantation failure.  However, not all\n      studies have shown a beneficial effect, and those demonstrating benefit have been limited by\n      small sample sizes, and considerable heterogeneity in the procedures and populations\n      evaluated.  A recent meta-analysis synthesized the available data concluded that a large,\n      prospective, well-designed randomized trial is desperately needed to definitively assess\n      this new possible treatment.  If these preliminary findings from previous trials are\n      confirmed, this practice could be applied in the clinical setting to help patients suffering\n      from repeated implantation failures."
