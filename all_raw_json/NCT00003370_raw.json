Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of\n      6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114) in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory\n      solid tumors.\n\n      II. Determine the incidence and severity of other toxic effects of MGI-114. III. Determine a\n      safe and tolerable dose of MGI-114 to be used in phase II studies.\n\n      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of MGI-114 in these patients. V. Determine preliminary\n      evidence of antitumor activity of MGI-114 against recurrent or refractory pediatric solid\n      tumors.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. If the dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression\n      in stratum 1, then stratum 1 is closed and stratum 2 opens.\n\n      Stratum 2 consists of the following: patients receiving no more than 2 prior chemotherapy\n      regimens; patients who have not received prior central axis radiation or bone marrow\n      transplantation; and patients with no known bone marrow involvement. Patients receive\n      intravenous 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene over 10 minutes daily for 5 days. The course is\n      repeated every 28 days unless disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are\n      observed. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive up to 1 year of therapy. If\n      dose limiting toxicity occurs in 2 of 6 patients at a given dose level, then dose escalation\n      ceases and the next lower dose is declared the maximum tolerated dose.
