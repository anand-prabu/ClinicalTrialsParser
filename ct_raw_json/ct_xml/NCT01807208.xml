  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are two fold: 1) To learn whether a personalized patient health goal
      and reminder tool helps patients to learn more about their condition and to make changes in
      behavior and medication taking to reduce the risk of another heart attack. 2) To examine a
      blood sample to learn how patients are responding to their medications. The study team will
      enroll approximately 220 patients in the hospital recovering from a heart attack.  Half of
      the patients will receive the educational tools and a copy will be sent to their outpatient
      provider.

      The goals of this study are two fold: 1) To evaluate the impact of a personalized patient
      health goal education and reminder tool on patient adherence to evidence based therapies and
      subsequent cardiovascular risk factor modification after acute myocardial infarction (AMI);
      2) To assess age-related heterogeneity in antiplatelet response among AMI patients This is a
      prospective study of 200 AMI patients, with at least half over age 65 years, treated with
      antiplatelet therapy at the time of enrollment. Patients will be surveyed with
      questionnaires (at baseline and 6 months post discharge) and biomarkers (baseline only) to
      assess the status of their physical function, depression, nutrition, inflammation, and
      response to antiplatelet therapies. Four - six weeks after hospital discharge: 100
      randomized patients and their outpatient providers will receive a evaluate the impact of a
      personalized post-AMI health goal education and reminder tool on patient adherence to
      evidence-based secondary prevention therapies and long-term clinical outcomes. Data will be
      analyzed in aggregate using descriptive statistics. The primary endpoint of interest is a
      composite measure of at six months adherence to secondary prevention therapies described as
      the sum of measures received divided by the sum of available opportunities. The secondary
      endpoint will be analyzed to describe platelet response profiles as a function of age. The
      study team anticipates the risks for this study to be minimal, since the patient does not
      receive any investigational therapies.

    <description>The study team plans to evaluate the impact of a personalized patient health goal education and reminder tool on 6-month clinical and other health outcomes. The measure will be a composite of lab measures (such as blood pressure at goal; BMI at goal), behavior change (physical activity, smoking cessation) and medication use (beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins if not contraindicated)</description>
