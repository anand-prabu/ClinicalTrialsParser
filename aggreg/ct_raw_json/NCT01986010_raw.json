Each treatment arm of 10 participants\n      will be accompanied by a placebo arm of 4 participants. The initial treatment arm of HCMV\n      seropositive participants will receive V160 Low Dose without adjuvant by intramuscular\n      injection. Escalation of the V160 dose, inclusion of adjuvant, administration by intradermal\n      injection, and vaccination of HCMV seronegative participants will be performed only after\n      review of safety data of previous treatment arms. The purpose of the study is to identify\n      vaccine formulations associated with optimal safety profile and HCMV-specific immune\n      response for evaluation in subsequent clinical studies of V160."
