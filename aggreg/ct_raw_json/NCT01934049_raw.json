After indicated\n      surgical treatment, hip fracture patients experience high rates of postoperative\n      complications, postoperative delirium (PD), postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD),\n      leading to poor postoperative recovery during hospitalization, which can cause disability,\n      distress for both patients and their families, are associated with other medical\n      complications and account for significant additional health care costs. We currently use\n      dexmedetomidine in elderly patients with hip fractures undergoing hip hemi-arthroplasty in\n      order to improve postoperative recovery and prevent and treating PD and POCD.\n\n      Dexmedetomidine is a drug used for sedation in critically ill patients that provides some\n      pain relief and controls the bodies response to stress. The sedation produced by\n      dexmedetomidine appears more similar to natural sleep than any other drug used for\n      anesthesia and postoperative sedation. Data suggesting that dexmedetomidine can prevent\n      delirium following cardiac surgery and the developing understanding of the causes of PD and\n      POCD suggest that dexmedetomidine will be particularly effective."
