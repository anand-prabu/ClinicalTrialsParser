Using a fully crossed 2 (intensity) X 2 (duration) design, we will\n      demonstrate a dose-response relationship between volume of aerobic exercise and changes in\n      DNA methylation over four months among previously sedentary women.\n\n        -  Hypothesis 1: We predict that there will be an interaction between intensity and\n           duration characterized by a dose-dependent response to total exercise volume, such that\n           women will experience the greatest improvements in methylation at high intensity/high\n           duration (16.4 kcal/kg/week) and the least improvements in methylation at low\n           intensity/low duration (5.6 kcal/kg/week).\n\n        -  Hypothesis 2: We predict that there will be a main effect of exercise duration, such\n           that women exercising for 40 minutes/session, 4 sessions per week will show more\n           improvement in DNA methylation compared with women exercising for 20 minutes/session, 4\n           sessions per week.\n\n        -  Hypothesis 3: We predict that there will be a main effect of exercise intensity, such\n           that women exercising at 75% of VO2max will show more improvement in DNA methylation\n           compared with women exercising at 55% of VO2max.\n\n      Specific aim 2. There are no published data on the extent to which positive effects of\n      exercise on methylation might decay if exercise is not continued. We will gather data on the\n      natural history of methylation decay after training.\n\n      \u2022 Hypothesis 4: At six months following the end of supervised exercise, we will assess the\n      influence of the different levels of initial training and the passage of time on DNA\n      methylation, covarying whether or not participants continued to exercise. It is predicted\n      that the highest volume group will show the greatest persistence of positive changes in DNA\n      methylation. Alternatively, it is possible that all four groups will return to baseline\n      methylation levels of methylation, and there will be no difference in methylation at 6\n      months following the end of supervised exercise."
