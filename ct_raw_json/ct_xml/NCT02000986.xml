  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies dietary and exercise interventions in preventing cardiovascular
      disease in younger survivors of leukemia, lymphoma, or brain tumors. Eating a healthy diet
      and exercising regularly may reduce the risk in preventing cardiovascular disease in younger
      survivors of leukemia, lymphoma, or brain tumors.

      To study the effect of lifestyle changes (dietary and physical activity) on cardiovascular
      risk factors (BMI, Waist circumference and blood pressure) in childhood survivors of
      leukemia, lymphoma and brain tumors 2. To study whether there is a difference between the
      response to intervention between the different types of cancers (leukemia vs. lymphoma vs.
      brain tumors), and to correlate response to disease 3. To determine the feasibility of
      lifestyle changes in this patient population 4. To assess adherence to changes in dietary
      and physical activity during the course of this planned intervention.
