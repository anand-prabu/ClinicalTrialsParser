  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most common cause of liver disease
      in pediatrics, but little is known about its pathophysiology in children. While studies in
      obese adults with hepatic steatosis have described an increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis
      (DNL) depending on the diet, there are no studies exploring the mechanisms by which excess
      hepatic triglycerides increases in obese youths, thus explaining the accompanying
      dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome. The central hypothesis of this study is that
      hepatic conversion of carbohydrates to lipid (DNL) is enhanced and associated with
      accumulation of excess liver fat, dyslipidemia and hepatic insulin resistance in obese
      youths with hepatic steatosis. The overall goal is to examine whether hepatic DNL is
      increased in obese youths with steatosis compared to matched controls without steatosis.

      Hypotheses: Hepatic conversion of carbohydrates to lipid (DNL) is enhanced and is associated
      with accumulation of excess liver fat, dyslipidemia and hepatic insulin resistance in obese
      youths with hepatic steatosis.

      In this study obese youths (12-18 years) will undergo MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
      measurement of liver lipid content to determine hepatic fat content. They will undergo a
      sugary drink (75 grams of glucose and 25 grams of fructose) challenge and Hepatic de novo
      lipogenesis will be determined as the incorporation of deuterium, from deuterium labeled
      water (D2O), into plasma triglycerides. Subjects will undergo a 6 hours study assessing de
      novo lipogenesis, an oral glucose tolerance test, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, magnetic
      resonance imaging, and Euglycemic-Hyperinsulinemic Clamp.

        The majority of the research subjects will be recruited from the Yale Pediatric Obesity
        Clinic and the Endocrine Clinic. Following the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT):normal
        glucose tolerant if plasma glucose at two hours is &lt;140 mg/dl and impaired glucose
        tolerant if plasma glucose is â‰¥140 mg/dl. All subjects must be in good general health,
        have a normal medical history and physical exam, and have no endocrinopathies or other
        diseases that might affect glucose metabolism. They will not be on any medications that
        are known to alter glucose or insulin metabolism or certain psychiatric medications.
        Subjects determined to be eligible will receive a MRI to determine Hepatic Fat Content.
        Subjects will agree to genetic testing to determine genotype.
