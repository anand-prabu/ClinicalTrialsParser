            "textblock": "Background:\n\n        -  Eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders (EGID) are a group of related\n           disorders that affect the esophagus, stomach, and bowel. There are two major types of\n           EGID, eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic gastroenteritis. They are caused by the\n           body's immune system being activated by food allergens, which then damages the gut\n           wall.  People with EGID have large numbers of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell)\n           in their gut. EGID can cause difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, or nausea.\n\n        -  At present, there are no drugs specifically approved to treat EGID. Most adults who\n           have EGID receive steroid therapy to manage the symptoms. However, long-term steroid\n           use may cause other problems in the body. Researchers want to see if low-dose sirolimus\n           can be used to treat EGID. Sirolimus is a drug used to prevent rejection of\n           transplanted organs. It may be able to keep the body's immune cells from being\n           activated by food allergens and decrease the eosinophils.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see if low dose sirolimus is safe and decreases blood or gut eosinophils in EGID.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Individuals between 18 to 65 years of age who have EGID.\n\n        -  Participants must also have an elevated blood eosinophil count and positive blood tests\n           for IgE antibodies to foods.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants who are on medicine for EGID or related symptoms must be on a stable dose\n           for 1 month before screening and stay on that dose throughout the study.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam, and review\n           their symptoms. They will provide blood and urine samples. They will also have heart\n           and lung function tests. Some participants may have allergy skin tests.\n\n        -  At the first study visit, participants will have 2 days of inpatient tests. They will\n           repeat the tests from the screening visit. They will also have a full analysis of the\n           esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. On the second day, they will start to take\n           sirolimus as a liquid with orange juice or water.\n\n        -  Participants will continue to take sirolimus at home. They will record their doses and\n           any symptoms. They will also have a visit to provide blood samples about 2 weeks after\n           the first study visit.\n\n        -  At the second study visit (about a month after the first visit), participants will\n           repeat the tests from the screening visit. The sirolimus dose may be adjusted as\n           needed.\n\n        -  Participants will take sirolimus for at least another 28 days. Depending on the dose of\n           the drug and the blood test results, some participants may need to take it for up to\n           112 days. Those who take the drug for a longer period will have additional study visits\n           with tests.\n\n        -  There will be another study visit when participants stop taking the drug. The last\n           visit will be a final follow-up visit."

            "textblock": "Eosinophil-Associated Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGID) are a group of related disorders\n      characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and eosinophilic infiltration of the\n      gastrointestinal wall. The 2 major forms of EGID, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and\n      eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG), differ in regard to the site of inflammation (esophagus\n      vs. stomach/small bowel). Both EoE and EG are highly associated with coexisting allergic\n      disease, and a large fraction of EGID patients are sensitized to multiple food allergens.\n      Existing data strongly support the concept that EGID is a food-allergen-driven,\n      eosinophilic, inflammatory gut disease. Multiple lines of evidence support a major role for\n      Th2 cells and the cytokines they express (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in EGID pathogenesis.\n\n      There are presently no drugs with a labeled indication for EGID. Most adult patients are\n      managed long-term with corticosteroid therapy, which raises concerns about toxicity.\n      Sirolimus is an immunomodulator approved for use in preventing transplant rejection. It\n      specifically inhibits Th2 cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting it may have activity in\n      EGID.\n\n      This study is an open-label dose-escalation design intending to target sirolimus whole blood\n      concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 ng/mL. Twenty adult EGID subjects    10 with EoE and 10 with\n      EG   with evidence of Th2-mediated IgE sensitization and peripheral blood eosinophil counts\n      greater than or equal to800 cells/  L will be recruited to participate. Subjects will begin\n      sirolimus at a dose of 0.2 mg/m2/day; this dose will be serially adjusted in each subject at\n      28-day visits to target the above blood concentrations. Blood will be drawn at each visit to\n      monitor drug levels and safety labs."

Subjects currently on medication for their EGID or for GI symptoms must be on a\n             stable dose for 1 month prior to screening and be willing to continue on that dose\n             for the duration of the study. Other medications (e.g. for hypertension, asthma, or\n             depression) may be adjusted by the subject   s physician.\n\n          7.

Agree to practice abstinence or effective contraception as detailed below.\n\n        Contraception: The fetal risks associated with sirolimus are not known, but pre-clinical\n        animal data demonstrate some risk. Subjects must agree not to become pregnant or\n        impregnate a female, accordingly. Females of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy\n        test at each NIH visit. Because of the risk involved, both male and female subjects and\n        their partners must use 2 methods of birth control. As per the sirolimus package insert,\n        subjects must continue to use both methods for 3 months after stopping the study drug. Two\n        methods of birth control may be selected from the list included below:\n\n          -  Hormonal contraception.\n\n          -  Male or female condoms with or without a spermicidal.\n\n          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with a spermicidal.\n\n          -  Intrauterine device.\n\n        If pregnancy is suspected or should occur, subjects must notify the study staff\n        immediately.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Individuals will not be eligible to participate in this study if they meet any of the\n        following criteria:\n\n          1.
