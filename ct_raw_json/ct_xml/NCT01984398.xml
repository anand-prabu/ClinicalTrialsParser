      To determine and compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of each of two
      formulations of 12.5 mg and 25 mg Androxal administered to healthy male volunteers, and to
      determine and compare the safety of a single dose each of two formulations of 12.5 mg and 25
      mg Androxal administered to healthy male volunteers.
