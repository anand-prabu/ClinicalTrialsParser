The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing targeted\n      messaging versus standard messaging. All subjects will receive information about the free,\n      union-sponsored smoking cessation program. Subjects randomized to the intervention group\n      will receive additional targeted materials to encourage enrollment in the union's smoking\n      cessation program. The intervention will include monthly mailed and text messages. The\n      investigators hypothesize that subjects who receive targeted messages will be more likely to\n      enroll in the union-sponsored smoking cessation program, be more likely to show change in\n      readiness to quit smoking, and be more likely to quit smoking compared to subjects who\n      receive only standard messaging."

Messages will be\n           specific to one of four audience segments determined by age and parental status.
