  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if treatment with laser therapy in pediatric patients
      undergoing renal biopsies will improve patient satisfaction of the overall procedure. In
      this study, the participant will receive a laser acupuncture treatment targeting either
      kidney acupoints or targeting &quot;sham&quot; points not associated with the kidney; the participant
      will not get both.  Both treatment sessions are given by a certified medical acupuncturist.
      The patient will still receive standard pain control protocols with anesthetic medications
      like lidocaine plus ketamine or fentanyl and versed during the biopsy, along with pain
      management after the procedure.  All medication will be administered without regard for
      which group the participant has been randomized, as the treatment team will also be blinded.

      Hypothesis:

      We will test the hypothesis that treatment with laser acupuncture in patients undergoing
      renal biopsies will improve patient satisfaction of the overall procedure.

      Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1:  Determine whether the use of laser acupuncture improves patient's overall
      satisfaction of renal biopsy.

      Specific Aim 2:  Determine whether the use of laser acupuncture decreases the amount of
      sedative medication given during renal biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At University of California San Francisco, there are approximately 100 pediatric renal
      biopsies per year.  All of these patients receive sedation, which is prescribed and
      supervised by the pediatric pain and palliative care team, with either ketamine or fentanyl
      and versed.  Child life is involved; however, many children still experience anxiety and/or
      pain with the procedure.  Use of a modality such as aculaser which may decrease these
      symptoms could enhance their experience.

      The term &quot;laser&quot; stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. In
      laser acupuncture, a low power, cold light produced by a low-level laser diode is used to
      stimulate an acupuncture point.  As it is non-invasive, laser acupuncture is thought to be
      safer than needle acupuncture, especially in the setting of patients with blood-borne
      infectious diseases.  In a systematic review analyzing the evidence to support the
      effectiveness of laser acupuncture, randomized control trials in which adults with soft
      tissue injury, acute or chronic pain condition, or any systemic illness were included. This
      review reports moderate level of evidence for treatment of myofascial pain and
      post-operative nausea/vomiting and limited evidence of the clinical effectiveness of
      treating chronic tension headaches.  Of note, no complications of the use of aculaser were
      reported in this review (1).
