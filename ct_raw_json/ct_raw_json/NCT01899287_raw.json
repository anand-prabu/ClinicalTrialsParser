The\n      burden of the disease is high in a personal as well as in a socio-economic context. There is\n      a need for evaluating new strategies to improve the prognosis for OHE patients. The\n      objectives of the study is to evaluate the effect of group education on sick lave,\n      health-related quality of life and disease severity among individuals with newly notified\n      OHE.\n\n      The trial population consist of individuals from the Capital Region of Denmark and Region\n      Zealand with a suspected skin-related industrial injury notified to the Danish National\n      Board of Industrial Injuries (DNBII). Recruitment is started Juli 2012, and will continue\n      until the designed number of participants have been included.\n\n      All participants will be assessed in a questionnaire at time T=0 with regard to: self\n      evaluated disease severity, health-related quality of life, skin protective behaviour,\n      knowledge of skin protection, self-efficacy, work-role function and if active in workforce.\n      The participants will then be randomised. The intervention group will be invited to\n      participate in the educative course, and work place visits will be offered. In the\n      intervention group a telephone hot line will be available for further questions concerning\n      these topics. The control group will not have access to any of these interventions. Both\n      intervention group and control group will be contacted every eighth week about number of\n      days of sick leave/absence from workforce. Both groups are re-assessed using a questionnaire\n      at T=12 months. There will be a total of 742 included participants.\n\n      ."
