Data supporting its safety and effectiveness in treating\n      ADHD symptoms in PDD are limited. Children and adolescents who do not show a positive\n      response to methylphenidate will be invited to participate in a pilot study of the\n      non-stimulant medication guanfacine (Tenex)."

The MPH\n      study has three parts:  a Test-Dose Period, a Double-Blind trial and an 8-Week Extension\n      Period (open-label).  After a screening visit, eligible children will start a 1-week\n      Test-Dose Period.  During this week, each child will be given the three MPH doses that are\n      used in the Double-Blind trial to make sure there are no serious side effects.  If problems\n      are encountered at the high dose level, that dose will not be given in the Double-Blind\n      phase. The Double-Blind phase lasts 4 weeks and consists of three different MPH dose levels\n      and a week of placebo.  Each treatment/dose is given for 1 week, and neither the researcher\n      nor the participants' families will know whether the medication is placebo or MPH.  Children\n      who do well during this phase will continue on the best dose of MPH (determined during the\n      Double-Blind phase) for an additional eight weeks (open-label).\n\n      Those who do not show significant improvement during the Double-Blind phase, do not tolerate\n      MPH during the Test Dose Period, or are not able to take MPH before beginning the study are\n      offered open-label treatment with guanfacine for 8 weeks.\n\n      Prior to randomization in the MPH trial OR entry into the open-label guanfacine trial, there\n      will be a medication-free period for children who are currently on medication.  The\n      withdrawal will be conducted in clinically appropriate way (depending on drug and duration\n      of treatment) to minimize withdrawal effects. This period is to establish a drug-free\n      baseline measurement and to minimize drug-drug interaction. No participant will be withdrawn\n      from a currently effective medication."
