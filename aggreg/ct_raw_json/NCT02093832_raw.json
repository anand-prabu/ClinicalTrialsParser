To examine the absolute difference between the implanted cup size diameter and the\n           actual femoral head size diameter.\n\n        3. To examine the absolute difference between the planned cup size diameter and the actual\n           femoral head size diameter\n\n        4. To suggest an additional online monitoring tool on the accuracy of the preoperative\n           process and implant selection. We hypothesized that high accuracy rates will be found\n           between the preoperative planned cup size and the actual implanted cup size.\n           Furthermore, we hypothesized that strong correlations will be found between the planned\n           and actual implanted cup size and the actual femoral head diameter size."
