Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal cells from the side\n      effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel and radiation therapy\n      plus chemoprotection with amifostine in treating patients with stage III or stage IV head\n      and neck cancer."

The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2-3 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      After determination of the MTD for paclitaxel, subsequent patients also receive amifostine\n      IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and radiotherapy on days 2-5 and 30-33.\n      Determination of the MTD for this drug combination is carried out as with paclitaxel alone.\n\n      At 4 to 8 weeks after the last treatment of radiotherapy, patients undergo CT scanning to\n      determine response. Patients with residual masses undergo neck dissection. Patients with\n      complete or partial response at the primary site are followed without surgery.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 37 patients will be accrued for this study."
