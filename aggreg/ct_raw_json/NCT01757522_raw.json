This can be prevented by modifying ventilator\n      settings, using vasopressors or inotropes or even by prone positionning.But to do so, right\n      ventricular dysfonction has to be detected. Echocardiography has emerged as a first line\n      tool to diagnose right heart failure. Recently, strain analysis showed promising results to\n      detect early right ventricle abnormalities in other settings such as pulmonary hypertension\n      or scleroderma. We therefore decided to determine whether 2D strain could help detect early\n      right ventricular dysfunction in ARDS."
