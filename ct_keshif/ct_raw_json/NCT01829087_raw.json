The current\n      treatment for patients who do not achieve full extension of the knee (flexion contracture)\n      after TKA consists of an aggressive physical therapy program, home stretching program, and\n      the use of an extension orthosis (brace).  Many patients do not tolerate wearing these\n      braces. This initial project is designed to use injections of Botox as an adjunct to the\n      standard current treatment and evaluate its efficacy.  It is our hypothesis that a single\n      injection into the hamstrings in addition to routine postoperative rehabilitation will\n      result in improved knee extension and this improvement in function should endure without\n      further treatment."
