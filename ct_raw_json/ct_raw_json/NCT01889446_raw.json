The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers it\n      safe and therefore, has no limitation on its use. Since PA has been shown before to serve as\n      a substrate for glucose production in the liver, the purpose of this study is to find out if\n      PA intake causes changes in levels of glucose, insulin and other important hormones\n      following a meal.\n\n      This research study will compare PA to placebo.  The placebo looks exactly like the active\n      substance, but it does not contain any active agent (PA).  Placebos are used in research\n      studies to see if the results are due to the study drug or to other reasons.\n\n      The investigators plan to have 20 subjects take part in this study at the Brigham and\n      Women's Hospital (BWH)."
