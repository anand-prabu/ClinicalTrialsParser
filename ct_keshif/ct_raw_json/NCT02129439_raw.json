            "textblock": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) represents one of the major entities of idiopathic inflammatory\n      bowel diseases which are defined as chronically relapsing inflammations of the\n      gastrointestinal tract not due to specific pathogens. It is characterised by a superficial,\n      continuous mucosal inflammation, which predominantly affects the large intestine. The\n      clinical course is typically marked by periods of asymptomatic remission punctuated by\n      unpredictable recurrent attacks. The symptoms of the patients are marked by persistent\n      diarrhoea with severe faecal urgency and often incontinence, rectal bleeding, abdominal\n      cramping and weight loss.\n\n      Uncontrolled activation of mucosal effector T cells has been identified as the main\n      pathogenic mechanism involved in the initiation and perpetuation of intestinal inflammatory\n      reactions.\n\n      Patients with moderate UC are initially treated with mesalazine, applied both orally and\n      rectally. If symptoms do not improve, systemic corticosteroids are to be administered.\n      Patients who do not respond to systemic corticosteroids may become eligible for treatment\n      with a calcineurin inhibitor or an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 antibody.\n      Alternatively, patients may have to undergo major colorectal surgery.\n\n      Patients who do not adequately respond to these treatment strategies exhibit serious\n      drawbacks. Colorectal surgery may result in a severely compromised quality of life.\n\n      Therefore, patients with moderate or severe UC may significantly benefit from new\n      therapeutic alternatives.\n\n      The transcription factor GATA-3 is an interesting target for a novel therapeutic strategy in\n      UC.\n\n      GATA-3 is the key regulation factor of Th2-driven immune responses. It is indispensable for\n      the differentiation and activation of Th2 cells, integrates Th2 signals, and induces Th2\n      cytokine expression. Results of a recent clinical trial in children showed that GATA-3 is\n      involved in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of UC.\n\n      The investigational product SB012 contains the DNAzyme hgd40 that targets GATA-3. By\n      cleaving GATA-3 mRNA hgd40 reduces specific cytokine production and thereby reduces key\n      features of mucosal inflammation.\n\n      DNAzymes are completely generated by chemical synthesis, not by use of any living organism\n      and are therefore not biological drugs.\n\n      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the\n      topical formulation SB012 available in a concentration of 7.5mg/ml hgd40 in 30ml PBS once\n      daily as a ready-for-use enema in patients with active UC."
