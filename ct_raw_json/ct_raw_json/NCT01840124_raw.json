            "textblock": "The ULTRA study is a single-arm trial of 100 premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine\n      fibroids who undergo treatment with the Acessa device. The Acessa device is a new FDA\n      approved minimally invasive treatment for uterine fibroids that uses radiofrequency energy\n      to destroy fibroid tissue. The fibroids then shrink and symptoms are significantly improved.\n      The radiofrequency energy is delivered to the fibroids during an outpatient surgical\n      procedure. There is minimal blood loss and pain and women return to the usual activities 5-9\n      days after the Acessa procedure.\n\n      The investigators will evaluate changes in fibroid-related symptoms from before the Acessa\n      treatment to 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after Acessa treatment. The investigators\n      will also assess operative outcomes including procedure duration, complications, blood loss,\n      post-operative pain, and the time to return to usual activities. The investigators will\n      determine long-term efficacy of Acessa by evaluating the rate of re-treatment for\n      symptomatic fibroids after the Acessa procedure.\n\n      Study participants will be recruited at 5 sites within the UC Fibroid Network: UC Davis, UC\n      Irvine, UC Los Angeles, UC San Diego, and UC San Francisco.  UC San Francisco will serve as\n      the Coordinating Center for the trial with oversight of all scientific and administrative\n      aspects of the study. All study data will be stored securely in a HIPAA compliant, secure\n      database monitored by the UC San Francisco Coordinating Center. A data safety and monitoring\n      board will oversee participant safety and protection."
