It is not yet known if MRI combined with MRSI is more effective than MRI\n      alone in detecting the extent of prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Diagnostic trial to compare the effectiveness of combining MRI with MRSI to that of\n      MRI alone in determining the extent of prostate cancer in patients who are scheduled to\n      undergo surgery to remove the prostate gland."

Within 6 months of MRI/MRSI, patients undergo\n      radical prostatectomy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 134 patients will be accrued for this study within 7 months."
