No efficacy objectives are included in this\n           clinical trial.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        -  To estimate the tolerability for all temsirolimus-treated patients throughout the study\n           and up to 28 days after the last dose of temsirolimus.\n\n        -  To correlate observed changes with the different type of endometrial carcinoma (type I\n           and type II), with regard to proteins related to mTOR (p4EBP1, pS6K1, c-MYC, cyclin D,\n           p27, BAD, p53, Bcl-2 PTEN, pAKT, mTOR),\n\n        -  To estimate the potential predictive value of some biomarkers (immunostaining for PTEN,\n           pAKT, mTOR), relevant mutations in PTEN, PI3KCA, k-RAS, CTNNB1, and microsatellite\n           instability status.\n\n        -  To estimate the prognostic value of Ki67 expression after short-term presurgical\n           therapy exposure\n\n        -  To collect data about the differences in expression profile, assessed by RNA\n           microarrays"
