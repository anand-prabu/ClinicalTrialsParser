            "textblock": "Rationale: A current problem in the context of a coverage decision for the use of mexiletine\n      for NDM patients is the lack of a sufficient evidence base. An innovative trial design could\n      facilitate in establishing such an evidence base in a small group of rather heterogeneous\n      patients. As more than 7000 rare diseases in Europe and the USA suffer from a similar lack\n      of treatment evidence, more experience with this innovative trial design would be very\n      helpful.\n\n      Study design: A double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled combined N-of-1- trial using\n      a Bayesian statistical approach.\n\n      Study population: Non-dystrophic myotonia (NDM) patients, at least 18 years old, with a\n      genetically confirmed diagnosis.\n\n      Intervention: Each  N-of-1 trial consists out of a minimum of one, and a maximum of 4\n      treatment sets, each comprising a 4-week period of active treatment (Mexiletine) and a\n      4-week period of treatment with placebo, in random order, with one week for wash-out in\n      between. Within each mexiletine period, treatment dosage of mexiletine will be built up from\n      200 mg 1 time a day PO on the first day of the first week, to 200 mg 2 times a day on the\n      second day of the first week, to the desired dosage of 200 mg 3 times a day PO on the third\n      day of the first week and throughout the remaining days of the 4-week treatment period.  A\n      similar build-up scheme will be used within each placebo period.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure for this study is a decrease in\n      the most prominent clinical symptom: stiffness. Stiffness will be quantified by an\n      Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) in which the patient will rate their mean daily IVR\n      participant-assessed severity of stiffness on an ordinal scale (1-9). The secondary outcome\n      measures will include changes in pain, weakness, and fatigue on IVR, Individual\n      Neuromuscular Quality of Life (INQoL), the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) a\n      patient-reported survey of patient health, blood plasma levels of mexiletine, clinical\n      myotonia assessments, quantitative handgrip myotonia, biceps force test and\n      needle-electromyography (EMG).\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group\n      relatedness: In the screening phase, electrocardiography (ECG) and EMG recordings,\n      laboratory values and baseline blood plasma levels of mexiletine will be tested. Medical\n      history and written consent will also be obtained in this phase. Patients will be asked to\n      visit the department of Neurology between 4-16 visits (depending on number of treatment sets\n      necessary to obtain enough evidence) during the study enrolment. Each visit will\n      approximately cost 2 hours; within each visit two questionnaires (INQoL, SF-36) need to be\n      filled, blood plasma levels of mexiletine will be measured and clinical and\n      electrophysiological myotonia tests need to be performed. Furthermore, an ECG and EMG will\n      be recorded at the end of each treatment or placebo period. In addition, patients will have\n      to call in to an interactive voice response system to report their mean daily IVR\n      participant-assessed severity of stiffness once a week in every first and second week and\n      daily in every third and fourth week of each treatment or placebo period."
