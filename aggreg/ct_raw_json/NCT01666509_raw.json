Eligible subjects\n      may or may not be using medication for their rosacea at the time of screening. Subjects with\n      concomitant use of rosacea treatments will be taken off their current medication and will\n      return for a Baseline Visit at the end of the wash-out period.\n\n      Eligible subjects will be stratified by gender at a ratio of 4:1 (Female: Male). Within the\n      strata, subjects will be randomised at Baseline in a 2:1 ratio in favour of Rossoseq\u2122 to\n      receive either Rossoseq\u2122 or vehicle.\n\n      Efficacy will be evaluated using subject rating of the rosacea specific quality of life\n      instrument (R-QOL; Nicholson et al, 2007) during office visits and applied over the phone\n      during the week 1 and follow-up telephone call at Week 5. An investigator rating will be\n      performed using a \"0=absent\" to \"3=severe\" grading of the RSGS primary features flushing,\n      nontransient erythema, papules and pustules, telangiectasia and the secondary features\n      burning or stinging, plaques, dry appearance, edema, ocular manifestations and phymatous\n      changes during the office visits. Ocular manifestations and phymatous changes need to be\n      absent to be eligible for the study.\n\n      Photographs to document treatment effects will be taken at screening, baseline, week 2 and\n      week 4."
