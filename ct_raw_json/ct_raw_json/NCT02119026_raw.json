            "textblock": "Since its introduction, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been the cornerstone of treatment for\n      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Meanwhile the oral 5FU pro-drug Capecitabine (Xeloda\u00ae)\n      proved equivalence to 5-FU and is a well tolerated alternative combination partner for\n      Irinotecan (XELIRI) or Oxaliplatin (XELOX) which are widely used for first line treatment of\n      mCRC. Recent advances in molecular biology have resulted in the development of an inhibitor\n      of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the monoclonal humanized antibody\n      bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae).\n\n      XELOX or XELIRI +bevacizumab have been investigated in several trials, but not in an\n      approach with clearly defined cross-wise XELIRI-XELOX change criteria. This trial\n      investigates two different sequential treatment options with XELIRI/ XELOX in first and\n      second line with the addition of bevacizumab and tries to give answer to the question if\n      there is an optimal sequence for the benefit of the patient.\n\n      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, 2-arm pilot trial in patients with mCRC who\n      did not receive systemic treatment for their metastatic disease. The study is designed to\n      evaluate the efficacy of XELIRI followed by XELOX and XELOX followed by XELIRI + bevacizumab\n      in terms of Duration of Disease Control (DDC).\n\n      Patients will be treated with an established first line therapy consisting of either XELOX\n      or XELIRI + bevacizumab. The chemotherapy treatment will be given for 6 months except prior\n      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. Bevacizumab will be given\n      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.\n\n      Capecitabine can be given in addition at the investigators' discretion until disease\n      progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.\n\n      If serious side effects occur despite adequate dose reduction, Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan\n      should be discontinued. In case of Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan-related discontinuation\n      Capecitabine and Bevacizumab should be continued. If Capecitabine also has to be\n      discontinued in first line treatment bevacizumab should be continued. In case of permanent\n      discontinuation of bevacizumab for toxicities, chemotherapy should be continued.\n\n      Upon completion of first line chemotherapy patients with disease control will receive\n      bevacizumab maintenance treatment. On investigators decision patients can receive\n      Capecitabine as additional maintenance treatment.\n\n      The primary endpoint is to determine the efficacy of a modified XELIRI + bevacizumab\n      followed by XELOX + bevacizumab scheme at progression in comparison with the reverse\n      sequence based on DDC.\n\n      Secondary endpoints are first line progression-free survival (PFS), second line PFS, overall\n      response rate, time to response, duration of response, overall survival, tumor assessments\n      (based on RECIST criteria) using CT scans, MRI scans, X-ray, bone scan, clinical\n      examination."
