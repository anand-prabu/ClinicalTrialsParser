RTMS is a noninvasive technology that can induce\n      changes in brain function that may lead to functional improvement in people with\n      hemiparesis.  This is a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled rTMS study in\n      conjunction with intensive daily occupational therapy (OT) for 2 weeks to improve motor\n      function in hemiparetic patients. Participants will be followed for at least 12 weeks after\n      rTMS to detect any clinical change. The sham group participants will be offered an\n      open-label active rTMS treatment plus OT after the 12 week assessment."
