The investigators predict that the investigators can improve the pain control\n      provided by morphine and effectively prevent morphine tolerance in the treatment of pain\n      with adjuvant manipulation of the D3 receptors. The investigators specifically aim to assess\n      the translational potential of D3 receptor modulation in human subjects experiencing painful\n      conditions as a means to enhance morphine analgesia."
