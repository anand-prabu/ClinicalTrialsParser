The randomized SDIS\n      study lasted for 7.5 years, whereas 96 patients were fully evaluated. Thereafter patients\n      were assigned to their regular clinical visits.\n\n      In the present study, 96 patients from the SDIS study were asked to participate in current\n      study and to investigate their skin microcirculation, in which 72 patients agreed (ICT; n=35\n      vs. ST; n=37). Exclusions criteria were; any history or ongoing ischemic foot ulcer or\n      peripheral artery disease or osteoartropathy. The iontophoresis investigation took place 5.5\n      years \u00b1 2 months, after the primary randomization ceased (7.5 years). Also, nineteen healthy\n      subjects participated as controls for the method of iontophoresis, with no intention to be\n      followed-up. All participants (except the control subjects) were then followed-up until\n      first time hospitalization for ischemic foot ulcer or until 31 december 2011."
