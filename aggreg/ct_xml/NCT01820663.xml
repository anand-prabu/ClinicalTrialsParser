  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study tests whether use of the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD) can improve motor
      impairment after stroke. It is based on the hypothesis that after stroke, the brain's
      utilization of glucose, it's primary source of energy, is disrupted. The MAD is a
      low-carbohydrate diet that has can switch the body's metabolism from using glucose to using
      products of fat metabolism, so-called ketones. Ketones may act as an alternative energy
      substrate for the brain. Ketones also have several neuroprotective effects after stroke.

          -  Hemorrhagic stroke

          -  Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia with LDL &gt; 250 on admission

          -  Uncontrolled Diabetes mellitus with BS &gt; 300 averaged over the first day of admission

          -  Nutritional risk as defined by BMI &lt; 18.5  or by a score of 2 or higher on the
             Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (scores BMI, % of unplanned weight loss in last
             3-6 months and question whether patient is acutely ill)

          -  Decreased renal function with  eGFR &lt;30%

          -  Stage III and IV pressure ulcers

          -  Osteoporosis not sufficiently treated with oral Calcium and Vitamin D supplements

             kidney stones such as Topamax, carboanhydrase inhibitors

          -  Inability to tolerate an oral diet and need for tube feeds

          -  Active enrollment in any other interventional studies at Burke; enrollment in
             observational studies or studies using TMS as a measurement may not pose exclusion
             criteria
