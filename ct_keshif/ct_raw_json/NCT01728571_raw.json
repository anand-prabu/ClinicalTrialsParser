            "textblock": "Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and pneumonia are leading causes of death in United\n      States and worldwide. COPD, which is also a significant source of disability, is increasing\n      in prevalence. Approximately 14 million adults have asthma, which leads to approximately 12\n      million missed work days per year in the United States. In adults, COPD and asthma often\n      coexist. Treatment options for COPD are limited, and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is\n      high. COPD lung disease (COPD, asthma, airflow obstruction), and most COPD additional\n      co-morbidities responsible for COPD progression (e.g., respiratory infections/pneumonia,\n      muscle weakness, cardiac failure) may benefit from vitamin D supplementation therapy, but\n      this requires rigorous testing. Marine omega-3 fatty acids work through different pathways\n      from vitamin D to affect inflammation. Observational studies and clinical trials suggest\n      that consumption of fish and/or fish oil may protect against COPD, asthma or pneumonia, but\n      the data are not consistent. Thus, there is a compelling need for a clinical trial to\n      evaluate the potential benefits or risks of vitamin D and fish oil supplementation on COPD\n      and asthma exacerbations, airflow obstruction and decline of lung function, and risk of\n      pneumonia.\n\n      The primary outcomes of interest in Lung VITAL are COPD/asthma exacerbations and dyspnea\n      (shortness of breath); airflow obstruction and decline of pulmonary function; and pneumonia.\n      Asthma control is a secondary outcome; and new-onset COPD and asthma are tertiary outcomes.\n\n      Lung VITAL will be conducted among all 20,000 participants in VITAL (NCT 01169259).\n      Additionally, the effects of vitamin D and fish oil supplementation on the level of as well\n      as the rate of decline of lung function will be evaluated in a subset of VITAL participants\n      during home visits or clinic visits."
