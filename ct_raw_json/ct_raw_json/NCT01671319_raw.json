This study looks at a different schedule for giving\n      the same adjuvant chemotherapy so that treatment can be completed faster (in 8 weeks rather\n      than 12 weeks).  This study uses a growth factor drug, pegfilgrastim, to help build blood\n      cells that are lowered because of chemotherapy, making it possible to receive TC treatment\n      every 2 weeks (referred to as \"dose dense TC\" or \"ddTC\") instead of the standard 3 week\n      schedule.  The main study procedures are blood draws, chemotherapy treatment, physical\n      exams, and pegfilgrastim injections."
