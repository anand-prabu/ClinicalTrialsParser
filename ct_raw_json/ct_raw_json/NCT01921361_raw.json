In case heart rate decreased by more than\n      30% of the baseline atropin received and blood pressure decreased 30% of the baseline\n      effedrin received.\n\n      Side effects (bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, nausea and vomiting etc ) were recorded\n      peroperatively in the operating room and postanesthetic care unit."
