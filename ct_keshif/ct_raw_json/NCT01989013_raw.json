At the end of 3 months each patient will have total of 9\n      hours of CranioSacral Integrative therapy induced, we will document the symptoms and\n      shortcomings of the patients at evaluation, before and after therapeutic treatment on a\n      measured scale ranging from 1-10. Finally graphically and statistically measure the quality\n      of change in the symptoms at the end of 3 months and provide executive summary of the\n      research finding, which the investigators expect to be a positive one."
