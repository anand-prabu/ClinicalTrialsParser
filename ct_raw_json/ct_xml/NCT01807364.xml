  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids has changed congenital adrenal
      hyperplasia (CAH) from a fatal to a chronic lifelong disease. Long-term treatment, in
      particular the chronic (over-)treatment with glucocorticoids, may have an adverse effect on
      the cardiovascular risk profile in adult CAH patients. The objective of this study was to
      evaluate the cardiovascular risk profile of adult CAH patients.

      Treatment with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids has changed congenital adrenal
      hyperplasia (CAH) from a fatal to a chronic lifelong disease. Long-term treatment, in
      particular the chronic (over-)treatment with glucocorticoids, may have an adverse effect on
      the cardiovascular risk profile in adult CAH patients. The objective of this study was to
      evaluate the cardiovascular risk profile of adult CAH patients.

      DESIGN: Case control study Primary objective : detection of cardiovascular damage in
      patients with classical or non classical CAH diagnosed in childhood. The patients will be
      compared with age- and gender- and tobacco status- matched control.

      Secondary objective Study of microvascular function Evaluation of cardiovascular risk
      factors Total cumulative (TCG) and total average (TAG) glucocorticoid doses will be
      calculated from pediatric and adult files and correlated to arterial macro- and
      microcirculatory dysfunction.

      Primary outcome Ultrasound evaluation of intima-media thickness at common carotids, carotid
      bulbs and left ventricular function Secondary outcome Peripheral and central blood pressure
      Skin capillary density and pulse-wave velocity Glucose and insulin during an oral glucose
      tolerance test Circulating cardiovascular risk markers (hsCRP, adiponectin, Interleukin-6)
      Lipid profile Anthropometry, fat and lean mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
      Total cumulative dose of glucocorticoid Number of subjects : 90 patients/90 controls
      Inclusion criteria of CAH patients

        -  Patients &gt; 18 yrs with classical or non classical CAH diagnosed during childhood

        -  Absence of known cardiovascular disease

        -  Absence of combined oral contraceptives during the previous month Inclusion criteria of
           controls

        -  Age under 18

        -  Absence of known cardiovascular disease
