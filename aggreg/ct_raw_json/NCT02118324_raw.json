The intervention will consist of 30 minute sessions of exergaming 3-5 times a\n      week for 6 months, with weekly assessment of exercise level and phone calls by kinesiology\n      graduate students for safety and compliance. Physical activity at baseline and at the end of\n      study will be assessed using accelerometers. Outcome measures will include: anthropometrics,\n      blood pressure, body composition, visceral fat, vascular function, fasting insulin, fasting\n      glucose, LDL-cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol, triglycerides, functional mobility and\n      endurance, and strength."
