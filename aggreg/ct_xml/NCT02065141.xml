  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to validate a new method in healthy volunteers that is able
      to measure protein digestion and absorption simultaneously. The ultimate goal for future
      research is to apply this method to quantify digestion and absorption in patients who are
      suspect of impaired digestion and absorption resulting in loss of nutrients, such as
      critically ill.

      Depending upon the information provided by this study we can develop a new research protocol
      in patients who are suspect of maldigestion and/or malabsorption, such as critically ill,
      and subsequently develop treatment strategies to improve protein digestion and absorption in
      these patient groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves 1 screening visit of approximately 1 hour and 1 test day of approximately
      9 hours. On the study day protein digestion and absorption will be measured using a mixture
      of amino acids that are made slightly heavier than normal, called stable isotopes. Subjects
      will receive continuous feeding by sips and 125 mg of the NSAID Indomethacin. The
      Indomethacin is provided to induce small changes in absorption, which can be picked up by
      stable isotope technology.
