  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of nimodipine in preventing a
      luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in women undergoing ovulation induction with clomiphene
      citrate. It is important to prevent the premature LH surge in controlled ovarian stimulation
      to allow adequate recruitment of follicles, proper maturation of a dominant follicle before
      ovulation, and effectively time insemination with semen to allow fertilization of a mature
      egg to occur.

      The investigators are also conducting this study to determine medication side effect profile
      (including lightheadedness or dizziness from low blood pressure or rapid heart rate,
      headache, and nausea), patient treatment compliance, and clinical pregnancy (positive
      pregnancy test and ultrasound evidence of fetal heart rate).  Finally, LH and follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels will be measured to determine effect of nimodipine on
      these hormones.

      As a calcium channel blocker, nimodipine has been shown to block calcium mediated release of
      gonadotropin releasing hormone in animal and preliminary human studies.  The investigators
      hypothesize that nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, will prevent or delay the LH surge
      during controlled ovarian stimulation cycles using clomiphene citrate in subfertile patients
      undergoing assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination (IUI).
