An intracranial aneurysm is a bulge in the\n      wall of a blood vessel in the brain.  The bulge is caused by a weakening of the vessel wall.\n      If left untreated, the bulge may continue to grow larger and ultimately the vessel may break\n      open (rupture), resulting in serious bleeding into our around the brain.  The information\n      collected from this study will be used to evaluate how well patients do when treated with\n      the Surpass System both immediately after treatment of an aneurysm and over a long period of\n      time (5 years)."

The catheter containing the device is inserted and advanced into a vessel in the brain.  The device is then placed in the brain vessel by releasing it from the catheter.  Once the device is placed inside the brain vessel, it is intended to reinforce the area of the vessel that is weakened and bulging (the aneurysm), and to cause blood to flow down the vessel and away from the aneurysm.  This procedure is called an endovascular aneurysm treatment because the device is delivered through the blood vessels.",
