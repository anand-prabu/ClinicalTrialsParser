People with atopic dermatitis have defects in the skin barrier as well as\n      defects in the immune system which fights off skin infections. People who have atopic\n      dermatitis often have complications from viral and bacterial skin infections, such as\n      recurring Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), or Staph infections. The purpose of this study\n      is to look at how defects in the skin barrier and immune response affect risk for skin\n      infections. The study will compare the skin barrier and immune response of people with and\n      without atopic dermatitis in relation to whether Staph bacteria is growing on their skin.\n\n      Participants will be classified based on Atopic Dermatitis (AD)/Non-Atopic (NA) status and\n      S. aureus colonization into 4 groups. S. aureus colonization status will be based on the\n      result of the non-lesional skin swab and will be quantified on a scale of 0-4 based on the\n      number of quadrants with S. aureus colonies when plated."
