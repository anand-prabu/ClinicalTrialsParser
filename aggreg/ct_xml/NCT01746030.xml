  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the prevalence of geriatric syndromes in older adults with multiple
      myeloma, examine relationships between baseline geriatrics syndromes and initial treatment
      selection, and examine risk of functional decline.

      Relationship between baseline geriatric questionnaires and initial treatment selection in
      older adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      Feasibility of subjects completing the CARG geriatric assessments at baseline, 3 months and
      6 months.

      Comorbidities or dependence in IADLs at baseline predict decline in functional status at 6
      months of follow-up in older adults with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

    <description>The physician caring for the patient will be asked to identify his/her initial treatment recommendations.  This includes whether the patient is, in his/her assessment, a candidate for high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.  It will also include whether a 2-drug or 3-drug regimen is recommended initially.</description>

    <description>Logistic regression analyses, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) based on model will be given with 95% CIs. All analyses will use two-tailed significance levels of 0.05 and will be conducted with statistical software SAS 9.2. Geriatric assessment variables will be analyzed as continuous or ordinal variables as indicated. Candidate variables will include: demographic data (including age, gender, race), disease data (stage, cytogenetic abnormalities), or geriatric assessment variables (comorbidity, functional status, physical function, psychological state, nutrition, social support and social activity). Analyses will be performed for the outcomes of treatment selection (transplant vs non-transplant) and increased dependence in IADLs</description>
