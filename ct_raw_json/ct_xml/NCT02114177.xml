  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a treatment regimen of 12
      weeks or 8 weeks of simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir in chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) genotype 1 infected men and women without cirrhosis who are HCV treatment-naïve or
      treatment-experienced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), multicenter study. The study will consist of a
      screening phase up to 6 weeks, open-label treatment phase of 8 weeks or 12 weeks, and
      post-treatment follow up phase up to 24 weeks after end of treatment. Approximately 300
      participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive 150 mg simeprevir in
      combination with 400 mg sofosbuvir once daily either for 12 weeks (Arm 1) or 8 weeks (Arm
      2). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      vital signs, and physical examination. The maximum study duration for each participant will
      be approximately 42 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 36</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>HCV-SIQv4 is a self-administered questionnaire which contains 33 items classified as 3 categories of scores: sum of responses to 29 symptom items as a symptom severity score category, sum of response to 3 items as a time missed from work/school category, and 1 response to question regarding the impact of symptoms on daily activities as an impairment in daily activity score category. The total score is the sum of scores of these 3 categories. Higher HCV-SIQv4 scores indicate worse symptom severity, more time missed from work/school, and more impairment in daily activities.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 36</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The FSS is a self-administered questionnaire with 9 items developed to assess disabling fatigue. These 9 item responses are measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1 point) to strongly agree (7 points). The 9 items are averaged to produce a total score. A lower total score indicates less effect of fatigue on everyday life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 36</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The CES-D scale assesses how often during the past week participants experienced 20 symptoms commonly associated with major depression. CES-D scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 60 (all 20 symptoms most or all of the time during the past 5-7 days). The CES-D scores between 16 and 23 points indicate mild to moderate depressive illness while CES-D scores greater than or equal to 23 indicate probable major depressive illness.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Questionnaire Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 36</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a brief, generic health-related quality of life assessment (HRQOL) that can also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D questionnaire assesses HRQOL in terms of degree of limitation on 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and as overall health using a &quot;thermometer&quot; visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health). Lower scores indicate worsening. EQ-5D scores include EQ-5D valuation index score which includes a weighted scoring of the 5 dimension scores with a possible range from 0 to 1, EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS) is a 20 cm vertical VAS with scores ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (perfect health), and EQ5D descriptive system scores consist of five scores reflecting each of the 5 EQ-5D health dimensions ranging from 0 [no limitation] to 4 [incapacity]).</description>
