The settings will be the\n      orthodontic departments of 1 dental teaching hospital (Jamia Millia Islamia Dental hospital)\n      Participants for the trial will be identified from treatment waiting lists and new patient\n      clinics.\n\n      Proper randomization procedures and reporting include the following steps.\n\n        1. Generation of the random allocation sequence, including details of any restrictions.\n\n        2. Allocation concealment.\n\n        3. Implementation of the random allocation sequence:\n\n      information on who generated the allocation sequence, who enrolled the participants, and who\n      assigned them to their groups.\n\n      OPEN SURGICAL EXPOSURE\n\n        -  surgically uncover the canine tooth and bone removal exposing the largest diameter of\n           the ectopic canine crown. The edges need to be substantially trimmed back and dental\n           follicle removed to prevent reclosure of the very thick palatal mucosa. For a deeply\n           buried and palatally displaced tooth, the exposure will additionally need to be\n           maintained using surgical pack.\n\n        -  Surgical excision of the palatal mucosa\u2014standardized using a preformed wire template.\n\n        -  Surgical gauze soaked in Whitehead varnish (iodoform 10 g, benzoin 10 g, prepared\n           storax 7.5 g, tolu balsam 5 g, and solvent ether to 100 ml) or Coe-pack surgical\n           dressing was sutured in place.\n\n        -  The patient will be reviewed 10 days later and the surgical pack removed and the\n           bracket bonded and force application started/Once the tooth has erupted sufficiently\n           for an orthodontic attachment to be glued onto its surface, orthodontic brace treatment\n           is commenced to bring the tooth into line.\n\n      CLOSED SURGICAL EXPOSURE\n\n      \u2022 surgically uncover the canine tooth and Surgical bone removal exposing the largest\n      diameter of the ectopic canine crown.\n\n        -  An multipurpose attachment with ligature wire and e chain will be bonded to the palatal\n           or buccal surface of the ectopic canine crown (whichever was the most accessible).\n\n        -  The palatal mucosa was sutured back intact with the gold chain extending through an\n           incision in the palatal flap.\n\n      Chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% w/v mouthwash was prescribed after surgery (10 mL 3 times per\n      day for 7 days, starting 4 hrs after surgery). OUTCOMES Definition of successful outcome The\n      successful outcome for palatally displaced canine was defined as the full eruption of the\n      tooth, thus permitting bracket positioning for final arch alignment when needed.\n      Unsuccessful outcome was represented by the lack of eruption of the permanent canine\n      (impaction) at the completion of the clinical observation period (48 months after the\n      initial observation)."
