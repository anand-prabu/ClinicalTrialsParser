  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the safety and maximum tolerated dose of brentuximab
      vedotin when given with tacrolimus and methotrexate after unrelated allogeneic donor stem
      cell transplant in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or
      myelodysplastic syndromes. The addition of brentuximab vedotin to tacrolimus and
      methotrexate may result in a significant reduction of graft versus host disease in these
      patients.

             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active pulmonary diseases, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements (this criterion should be met on screening and on the day of but prior
             to first dose of brentuximab vedotin).

          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

          -  Patient must not be known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapies.
