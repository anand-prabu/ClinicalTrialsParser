            "textblock": "This phase II trial studies how well ibritumomab tiuxetan before donor peripheral blood stem\n      cell transplant works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n      Giving rituximab, antithymocyte globulin, and total-lymphoid irradiation (TLI) before a\n      donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells and helps\n      stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also, radiolabeled\n      monoclonal antibodies, such as ibritumomab tiuxetan, can find cancer cells and carry\n      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells\n      from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem\n      cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells\n      from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving rituximab,\n      antithymocyte globulin, and TLI before the transplant together with cyclosporine and\n      mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening. Giving a\n      radiolabeled monoclonal antibody before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant may be\n      an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
