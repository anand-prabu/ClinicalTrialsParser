  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This is the first study where BAY1163877 is given to humans. Impact of the study is to
           evaluate if patients with advanced solid cancers show advanced clinical benefit under
           the treatment with the pan FGFR inhibitor. Patients (all comers) will receive the study
           drug treatment in a dose-escalation scheme (no placebo group) to determine the safety,
           tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY1163877. The relative
           bioavailability of liquid service formulation and tablets will be determined.

        -  After the MTD is defined patients with solid tumors (all comers), lung cancer (squamous
           non-small cell lung cancer) or bladder cancer will be enrolled according to their FGFR
           gene expression profile (biomarker stratification).

        -  The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics, biomarker status, pharmacodynamic
           parameters and tumor response of BAY1163877.

        -  BAY1163877 will be given twice daily as oral application. Treatment will be stopped if
           the tumor continues to grow, if side effects, which the patient cannot tolerate, occur
           or if the patient decides to exit treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For dose escalation: Subjects with any type of solid tumor (all comer) will be
             eligible for dose escalation and dose expansion at MTD in Part 1; Subjects enrolled
             for dose expansion (MTD expansion cohort &quot;all comer&quot;) will be stratified according to
             high fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) expression levels and the presence or
             absence of additional genetic alterations using archival or fresh tumor biopsy
             material.

             histological or cytological confirmed squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC)
             or bladder cancer (BC). All subjects in Part 2 (MTD expansion cohort &quot;sqNSCLC + BC&quot;)
             will be stratified according to high FGFR expression levels and the presence or
             absence of additional genetic alterations using archival or fresh tumor biopsy
             specimen. BC subjects with low overall FGFR expression levels can be included if
             activating FGFR3(FGFR tyrosine kinases3) mutations are confirmed.

             phosphate homeostasis (e.g. parathyroid disorder, history of parathyroidectomy, tumor

          -  Current evidence of corneal disorder / keratopathy including but not limited to
             bullous / band keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation / ulceration,

             Pre-existing cataract is not an exclusion criterion.

          -  Concomitant therapies that cannot be discontinued or switched to a different
             medication prior to study entry that are known to increase serum calcium and / or
