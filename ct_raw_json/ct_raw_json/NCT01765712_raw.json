Given the need for a\n      highly powered study to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of PRP in ACL reconstruction, the\n      investigators have designed a prospective, randomized, level 1, double-blinded study to\n      evaluate the effects of PRP on the specific outcomes of donor site pain and radiographic\n      measures of graft healing and incorporation.\n\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intra-operatively applied autologous\n      PRP in reducing donor site morbidity and increasing radiographic healing in ACL\n      reconstruction using autologous BPTB."
