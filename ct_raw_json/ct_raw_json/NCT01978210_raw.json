We hypothesize that the study protocol will be feasible, as measured through\n      review of achieved recruitment targets, successful randomization, and >80% retention of\n      subjects with com- plete data collection. Our second hypothesis is that therapists will\n      deliver experimental and standard behavioral treatment  intervention with \u226580% fidelity and\n      parents in both intervention groups will adhere to the intervention with \u226580% fidelity. A\n      secondary aim of this study is to examine trends in outcome data by conducting a small RCT\n      (N = 30) of wireless moisture alarm and standard behavioral toilet training, with the\n      hypothesis that the moisture alarm intervention will result in fewer toileting accidents, a\n      higher rate of toileting success and greater parental satisfaction."

The transmitter is housed in hardened plastic, attached to the disposable sensor, and, upon activation, emits a radio signal to the receiver. The receiver is an iPod-based app that emits an audible and/or vibration signal to the parent and child at the onset of a toileting accident. A step-by-step manualized curriculum is used to teach parents how to incorporate the device in the toilet training of their child.",
