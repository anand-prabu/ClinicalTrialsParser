      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of
      Rilotumumab (AMG 102) with Cisplatin and Capecitabine (CX) for untreated advanced
      mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET)-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction

    <description>1) Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G, type 2 (IgG2) against human hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) that blocks binding of HGF/SF to its receptor MET, inhibiting HGF/SF/MET-driven activities in cells. 2) Drug Cisplatin: A platinum containing chemo-therapy compound that reacts in vivo, binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA, which ultimately triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death). 3) Drug Capecitabine: A chemo-therapy prodrug that is enzymatically converted to 5-fluorouracil in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.</description>
