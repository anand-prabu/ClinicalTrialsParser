      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and
      10 years after receiving a primary vaccination of  meningococcal conjugate vaccine
      MenACWY-TT versus Meningitec™ or Mencevax™ ACWY, and the safety and immunogenicity of a
      booster dose of MenACWY-TT administered 10 years after the primary vaccination. All subjects
      received a  primary vaccination at 1 to 10 years of age in study 108658 (NCT00427908). No
      new subjects will be enrolled in this booster study.

      The study aims to evaluate the antibody persistence post primary vaccination with active
      control, safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose uncontrolled post primary vaccination
      during different phases:

      Persistence phase: Long-term persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after primary vaccination
      with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY, in study MenACWY-TT-027.

      Booster phase: One month post booster vaccination with MenACWY-TT vaccine ten years after
      primary vaccination.

      The subjects in this study will be allocated to the same groups as in the vaccination study
      MenACWY-TT-027 (NCT00427908).

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period

        Additional exclusion criteria for booster phase at Month 126 study entry (to be checked at
        Month 126) for all subjects:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product  other than the study vaccine
             within 30 days preceding the booster dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the
             follow-up period.

          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting
             30 days before the booster dose of study vaccine or planned administration within 30
             days after vaccination, with the exception of a licensed inactivated influenza
             vaccine.

          -  Chronic administration  of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the booster vaccine dose . Inhaled and topical steroids are
             allowed.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the booster vaccination or planned administration during the follow-up
             period.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product .

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccines.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including Guillain-Barré syndrome
             (GBS). History of a simple, single febrile seizure is permitted.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary, tympanic, or
                  ≥38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this
                  study will be oral.

               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
                  infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive
