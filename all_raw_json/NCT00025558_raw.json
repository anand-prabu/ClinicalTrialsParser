Peripheral stem cell transplantation or bone marrow\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide, thiotepa, and\n      carboplatin followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation or bone marrow transplantation\n      in treating patients who have brain cancer."

Patients who do not have adequate PBSC may undergo bone marrow harvest.\n\n      Patients then receive oral temozolomide every 12 hours on days -10 to -6 and thiotepa IV\n      over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days -5 to -3.\n\n      PBSC or bone marrow are reinfused on day 0. Beginning on day 1, patients receive G-CSF SC or\n      IV until blood counts recover.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at day 42, at 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for\n      1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
