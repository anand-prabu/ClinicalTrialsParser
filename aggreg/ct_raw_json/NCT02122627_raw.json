Vitamin D\n      deficiency is a common problem in patients with COPD..\n\n      Objective: To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate in\n      patients with COPD and a vitamin D deficiency.\n\n      Study design: Randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study.\n\n      Study population: 240 patients aged 40 years and older with COPD and a vitamin D deficiency\n      (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration(25OHD)<50 nmol/l) with a COPD exacerbation. An\n      exacerbation is defined as sustained worsening of respiratory symptoms during 48 hours and\n      requiring oral corticosteroid, antibiotic or combination treatment that was initiated by a\n      physician. Respiratory symptoms include at least one of the Anthonisen criteria (increased\n      dyspnoea, sputum volume or purulence). Patients with a severe vitamin D deficiency (25OHD<15\n      nmol/l), known osteoporosis and/or use of vitamin D supplementation > 400 IU per day will be\n      excluded.\n\n      Intervention: Participants will be randomly allocated to receive vitamin D3 16800 IU or\n      placebo orally once a week during 1 year.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is exacerbation rate."
