  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 4 year prospective, observational study of 40 patients yearly,
      comparing conventional clinically indicated SPECT and PET perfusion with dynamic rest/stress
      MPI studies with coronary angiography, in some cases performed with quantitative coronary
      anatomy and flow as well as quantitative 13N-ammonia PET MPI. Methods will also be assessed
      for their ability to determine myocardial viability by comparing regional wall motion (WM)
      on clinically indicated serial ventriculography, echocardiography or gated SPECT MPI in
      those protocol patients with WM abnormalities who subsequently undergo revascularization.
      Patient studies will begin in the first study year based on those methods already developed
      and integrate new advances as they become evident.

    <description>The coronary flow reserve will be measured by comparing the rest and stress exams on the dynamic SPECT scans using developed algorithms. The accuracy will be compared with clinical PET, coronary angiography, and clinical SPECT.</description>

    <description>Patients scheduled to have clinically indicated stress MPI with low pre-test likelihood (0-15%) of coronary disease based on criteria of Diamond and Forrester.

    <arm_group_label>Group II</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients in Group II who will have the dynamic imaging protocol studies after SCA, patients will be selected for protocol enlistment only if the decision is made by the patient's physician, based totally on clinical and social factors, that any considered revascularization intervention would not be performed on the day of diagnostic selective coronary angiography (SCA) and will be performed electively, at least 4 to 7 days later. Viability will be assessed in these patients only in the presence of WM abnormalities, and with serial analysis of WM, as described above. Patients will be followed for death or infarction or other events more than 3 months after study, for up to 3 years following participation in the protocol.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had clinically indicated stress MPI with a low pre-test likelihood
             (0 - 15% ) of coronary disease based on the criteria of Diamond and Forrester.

          -  Patients who have already had a clinically indicated stress MPI in the last three
             years with a low likelihood of having active coronary disease with no significantly
             narrowed coronary arteries.

          -  Patients whose clinically indicated stress MPI demonstrates clear abnormalities and
             who are likely to go on to SCA for clinical indications.

          -  If, after conventional and dynamic MPI some of these patients do not have SCA, they
             will still be followed for events for up to 3 years following participation in the
             protocol. To avoid delays and unnecessary procedures among patients in Group II who
             will have the dynamic imaging protocol studies after SCA, patients will be selected
             for protocol enlistment only if the decision is made by the patient's physician,
             based totally on clinical and social factors, that any considered revascularization
             intervention would not be performed on the day of diagnostic SCA and will be
             performed electively, at least 4 to 7 days later.

          -  Patients found at SCA to have lesions of &quot;borderline&quot; clinical significance,
             preferably in the absence of other associated lesions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cannot give informed consent

          -  Unable or unwilling to return for a second stress imaging study

          -  Cannot cooperate for adequate SPECT or PET supine and/or prone imaging

          -  Pregnant females

          -  Patients under 21 years old

          -  Active bronchospasm - No theophylline for 48 hours prior to study

          -  Heart block more severe than Wenckebach block

          -  Patients with uncomplicated infarction will not be included if they cannot have an
             exercise test later than 8 weeks of the event or a vasodilator pharmacologic stress
             test at least 24 hours or more after the event

          -  Coronary bypass surgery within 8 weeks

          -  Symptoms of congestive heart failure at rest

          -  Has had an event or change in drug regimen since the initial stress test.

          -  Has serious response to or side effect from initial clinical stress test induced ST
             elevation, hypotension, prolonged arrhythmia, bronchospasm.

          -  Has had a clinical event since last coronary angiogram, angioplasty, or coronary
             surgery.

          -  Has had 201Tl rest SPECT MPI prior to dynamic imaging
