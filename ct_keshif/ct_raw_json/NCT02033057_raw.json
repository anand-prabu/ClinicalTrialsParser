Study design: a\n      single center, prospective, randomized trial to be held in the ICU of \" Universitarian\n      hospital La Fe\"  in collaboration with the service of Neurophysiology of the hospital. All\n      patients undergoing sedation and mechanical ventilation (with an expected duration longer\n      than 48h) and without any of the exclusion criteria detailed in the Methodology section will\n      be included in the study. The intervention will consist of a muscular electrostimulation\n      with the Super Pro Excel 70,UltratoneTM. The stimulation will be performed in 10 muscle\n      groups (5 per side) following established protocols, at least 5 days a week.  We will\n      evaluate muscle strength by Medical Research Council scale, functional capacity  by  Barthel\n      scale and Neurophaty Disability Scale,  all clinical events will be collected and\n      electrophysiologic, echographic and histologic parameters will be measured. The process of\n      extubation will be performed following an established protocol, the duration will be\n      collected as the same manner as ICU."
