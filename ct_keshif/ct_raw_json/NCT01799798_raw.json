Efficacy will be assessed by DXA measurements at the lumbar spine of the areal\n      bone mineral density (BMD) which is the most frequently used parameter in trials\n      investigating osteoporosis.\n\n      The hypothesis of the study is:\n\n      Osteoclastic activity which is increased in OI could be reduced by inhibition of osteoclast\n      maturation. Denosumab inhibits maturation of the osteoclasts by inhibiting RANKL. BMD could\n      be increased during a 36 week treatment course with denosumab measured after 48 weeks."
