About a quarter of the adult\n      population suffers the disease.\n\n      Resveratrol is a substance found in many plants, including grapes, nuts and wine, but it's\n      also found in Polygonum cuspidatum. There is evidence that resveratrol consumption has\n      beneficial effects on glucose and lipids metabolism, blood pressure and body weight.\n\n      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on metabolic syndrome,\n      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis was that the administration of resveratrol modifies the\n      metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion."
