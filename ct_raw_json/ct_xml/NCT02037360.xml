      In this study, a pilot phase will be carried out first to test feasibility and engagement of
      the tested intervention. Then in the randomized control trial, subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive one of two treatments: (1) a standard smartphone application to support
      smokers working to become quit-free, or (2) the tested intervention, an app that trains
      mindfulness for smoking cessation. The primary endpoint of interest will be 1-week point
      prevalence abstinence at end of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months follow-up for individuals.

    <description>This is a 3-week smartphone-based training program that trains mindfulness for smoking cessation by helping smokers self-monitor their smoking habits, recognize when and how often they smoke, identify triggers for smoking, and learn methods to become more mindful of triggers, to quit smoking with a target quit date of 3 weeks.</description>

    <description>It is comprised of twenty-two modules of 10-15 minutes each, designed to teach mindfulness for smoking cessation using psychoeducation-based audio and videos, animations to reinforce key concepts, and in vivo exercises. In addition, 5 bonus modules become available upon completion of earlier modules; these may be accessed for additional practices to bolster other modules.</description>
