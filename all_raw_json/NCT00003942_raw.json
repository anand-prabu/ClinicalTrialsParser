Determine the safety of infusion of RevM10 or RevM10/polAS transduced\n      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in addition to high dose chemotherapy and standard peripheral\n      blood stem cell support in patients with HIV-1 related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine\n      gene marking of lymphocytes and myeloid cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and/or lymph\n      nodes after infusion of RevM10-HSC or RevM10/polAS-HSC in these patients. III. Determine the\n      antiretroviral effect of this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive mobilization therapy and undergo\n      leukapheresis according to a standard protocol. High dose chemotherapy is administered on\n      days -7 to -1, also according to a standard protocol. On day 0, autologous hematopoietic\n      stem cells transduced with genes RevM10 or RevM10/polAS are infused. Unmodified autologous\n      peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused on day 1. Patients are followed daily for 2 weeks,\n      weekly for 2 weeks, monthly for 1 year, then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 14\n      months."
