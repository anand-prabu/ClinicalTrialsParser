There is some data to\n      suggest that these types of medications can adversely affect bone healing in adult patients\n      with broken bones or those having spine fusion surgery. There is little data with regard to\n      how these medications effect bone healing in children. With this project, our goal is to\n      determine if NSAIDs delay or otherwise adversely effect bone healing and to demonstrate that\n      these medications adequately control pain in children with broken bones or those who have\n      had an osteotomy."
