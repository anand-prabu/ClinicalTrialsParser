      Primary objective

      To demonstrate that administration of the 9vHPV vaccine induces non-inferior Geometric Mean
      Titres (GMTs) for serum anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, compared to GARDASIL in 16- to
      26-year-old men

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of the 9vHPVvaccine in 16- to 26-year-old men.

        -  To summarise humoral immune responses, including anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45,
           52, 58 GMTs and seroconversion rates at 4 weeks post-dose 3, in 16- to 26-year-old men
           who received 9vHPVvaccine or GARDASIL

             physical examination, and laboratory results.

          -  Subject, or subject's parent or guardian, fully understand study procedures,
             alternative treatments available, the risks involved with the study, and voluntarily

             monoclonal antibody therapies, intravenous gamma globulin, antilymphocyte sera, or
             other therapy known to interfere with the immune response.

          -  Subject has received any immune globulin product or blood-derived product within the
             6 months prior to the Day 1 vaccination, or plans to receive any such product during
             Day 1 through Month 7 of the study.

          -  Subject has received non-replicating (inactivated) vaccines within 14 days prior to
             the Day 1 vaccination or has received replicating (live) vaccines within 21 days
             prior to the Day 1 vaccination.

          -  Subject has received a marketed HPV vaccine, or has participated in an HPV vaccine
             clinical trial and has received either active agent or placebo.

          -  Subject has had a fever within the 24-hour period prior to the Day 1 vaccination.
