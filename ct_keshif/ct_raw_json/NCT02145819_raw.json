            "textblock": "For surplus embryos after fresh IVF-cycles, cryopreservation has become common medical\n      practice. These frozen embryos are mostly replaced in an artificial cycle with exogenous\n      estrogen and progesterone or in a natural cycle. Often, hCG is administered as an ovulation\n      induction agent for scheduling purposes.\n\n      Successful implantation requires a co-ordinated series of events allowing a timely dialogue\n      between a receptive endometrium and the intrusive blastocyst . The period of receptivity is\n      thought to be 3 days in human. It is suggested that blastocyst apposition begins about day\n      LH+6 and is completed by day LH+10\n\n      In general, the aim is to transfer the embryo during the 'window of implantation', what is\n      defined as the period during which the uterus is receptive for implantation of the\n      free-lying blastocyst.  This has been a subject of debate since many years.\n\n      A prospective study by Fatemi et al. (2010) revealed a significantly higher ongoing\n      pregnancy rate after transferring frozen-thawed embryos in natural cycles with a spontaneous\n      LH peak compared with natural cycles controlled by hCG for final oocyte maturation and\n      ovulation (31.1% vs. 14.3%, respectively). In this trial, FrET (frozen embryo transfer) was\n      planned 5 days after the LH surge or 5 days after the administration of 5000IU of hCG.\n\n      In order to optimize the synchronization in the hCG group, and therefore enhance the\n      pregnancy rates, the aim is to plan a FrET 6 days after hCG administration instead of 5\n      days.  The rationale behind is that day 3 frozen embryos are thawed the day before embryo\n      transfer, which means  they are already at day 4 of the embryonic development."
