      This study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial.  Subjects in the study will be adults with New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      Class II-IV heart failure (HF) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;0.40, and secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH).  The
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and effects of tadalafil
      compared to placebo on the subjects' functional capacity / quality of life.
