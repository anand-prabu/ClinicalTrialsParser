            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the clinical usefulness of preoperative irinotecan in patients with\n      high risk, technically resectable metastatic colorectal cancer that is refractory to\n      fluorouracil. II. Evaluate prospectively the relationship between expression of selected\n      molecular determinants of response and clinical responsiveness to irinotecan in these\n      patients. III. Determine the effect of treatment with irinotecan on the expression of\n      putative response determinants in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly\n      for 4 consecutive weeks. Course repeats every 6 weeks. After 2 courses, CT scan is obtained\n      and patients showing evidence of disease that is still amenable to surgical resection\n      undergo surgery. Approximately 4-8 weeks after surgical resection, patients receive 3\n      additional courses of irinotecan in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for years\n      3 and 4.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued into this study."
