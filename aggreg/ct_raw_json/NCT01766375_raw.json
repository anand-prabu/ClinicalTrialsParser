It evaluates the effects and\n      safety of idarubicin 60mg/M2 combined with BUCY pretreatment program or BUCY pretreatment\n      program on acute myeloid leukemia patient in high-risk group. 200 patients were studied with\n      100 patients in each group.\n\n      Patients enrolled were randomly divided into group A (idarubicin 60mg/M2 combined with BUCY\n      group) and group B (BUCY group). SAS randomization software was used to obtain randomization\n      numbers. Patients were recommend to start pretreatment within 7 days after randomization.\n\n      Main objective: 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates.\n\n      Secondary objective: safety evaluation (early complications of transplantation, liver,\n      kidney and heart toxicity, treatment-related mortality, blood recovery time), the median\n      period of disease-free survival.\n\n      Test drugs Idarubicin (Zavedos \u00ae, Pfizer), busulfan, cyclophosphamide.\n\n      Pretreatment plan Drug Group A (IDA 60mg/M2 + BUCY) Group B (BUCY) IDA: 20mg/m2 a day, d-12\n      ~d-10, intravenous infusion for 1 hour.

Unrelated\n      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation used CSA MMF MTX ATG for the prevention\n      of GVHD. 3mg/kg CSA was infused through continuous intravenous drip since day -1 until\n      gastrointestinal function returned to normal when the administration method was changed to\n      oral. 5mg/kg was divided to twice oral intakes maintaining cyclosporine concentrations at\n      200-300ug/L; MTX 15mg/m2, at day +1, 10mg/m2 at day +3, day +6 and day +11 (based on actual\n      situations day 11 can be omitted); MMF 0.5g BID starting from day 0 and continued for 3\n      months (a month later, dose can be reduced according to the hemogram); the total ATG was\n      6mg/kg and was taken in three days, from day -4 to day -2.\n\n      Relapse intervention Routine preventive DLI is not recommended, however, if tendency of\n      recurrence found during monitor, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, secondary\n      transplantation, etc. can be used, and intervention treatment start time should be recorded\n      as the end time.\n\n      The efficacy evaluation time point\n\n        1. 1-3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months after transplantation.\n\n        2. Follow-up evaluation: indicators such as blood routines and bone marrow detection, and\n           minimal residual disease detection after the end of treatment should be done regularly."
