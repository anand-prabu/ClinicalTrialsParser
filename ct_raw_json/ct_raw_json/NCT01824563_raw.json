As a point of interest the investigators would like to evaluate the benefit to\n      patients with low-frequency residual hearing implanted with the HiFocus Mid-Scala Electrode.\n      The HiFocus Mid-Scala electrode array is designed to allow surgeons the flexibility to use a\n      variety of contemporary surgical techniques that have been shown to enable easy insertion\n      and to minimize cochlear trauma (see, e.g., Adunka and Buchman, 2007; Friedland and\n      Runge-Samuelson, 2009; Roland et al., 2007). Temporal bone experiments have shown the\n      HiFocus Mid-Scala electrode array to be straightforward to insert while causing minimal\n      trauma to cochlear structures during and after surgery (Lenarz et al., 2010). In addition ,\n      the HiFocus Mid-Scala has already shown to be a safe electrode and promising post op\n      clinical results in the premarketing study that is now in the final stage."
