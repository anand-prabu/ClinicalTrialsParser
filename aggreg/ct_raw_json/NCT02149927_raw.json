For each level EEG and fMRI connectivity analysis are performed using the recording length of 10 minutes. This results in one outcome parameter for EEG and fMRI connectivity. Furthermore, both modalities are combined resulting in one combined parameter for each level.\nFor EEG analysis permutation entropy as a measure of information content in EEG, and symbolic transfer entropy as a measure of directed interaction in EEG are used. fMRI functional connectivity analysis is based on BOLD ICA and on network analysis of the BOLD time series.",
