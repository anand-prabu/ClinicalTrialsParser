Patients undergo baseline bone densitometry of the femoral neck\n      and lumbar spine to assess bone density prior to starting chemotherapy or within 30 days of\n      the first drug treatment. Laboratory studies and bone densitometry are repeated at years 1\n      and 2. A comparison is made between the study findings at baseline and at years 1 and 2.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
