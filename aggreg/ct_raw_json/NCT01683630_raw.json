            "textblock": "Annual epidemics of influenza are an important public health problem globally and in Canada.\n      Each year, 10-25% of the Canadian population become infected with influenza. Most of these\n      infections are typically asymptomatic or associated with a mild self-limiting illness.\n      However, influenza can cause severe illness leading to hospitalization and death, especially\n      among the very young, the elderly and among those with underlying chronic conditions. It has\n      been estimated that on average about 4,000 influenza-related deaths occur in Canada each\n      year. In addition, the economic burden of influenza is significant because of the high\n      direct costs associated with increased utilization of services and the indirect costs caused\n      by school and work absenteeism.\n\n      This project compares laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B in terms of their\n      epidemiology and clinical outcomes, and describes the comparative epidemiology of\n      laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B cases in Manitoba over the period from 1990 to 2011.\n\n      This analysis compares, by influenza type, the overall and cause-specific incidence rates of\n      physician encounters, hospitalization and death following the diagnosis of a\n      laboratory-confirmed influenza. It also describes multivariate models to assess the effects\n      of influenza type on clinical outcomes (e.g., hospitalization) while accounting for\n      confounding by demographic, socioeconomic, geographic and clinical (e.g., co-morbidity,\n      immune status) characteristics.\n\n      The study also assesses secular and seasonal trends in the incidence rates of influenza A\n      and B cases in Manitoba during the period of 1990-2011, excluding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic\n      period (April 2009-April 2010) and assesses whether these rates vary for different subsets\n      of the population defined by demographic (e.g., age group, gender), socioeconomic,\n      geographic (neighborhood of residence) and clinical (e.g., vaccination, presence of chronic\n      conditions, immune status) characteristics."
