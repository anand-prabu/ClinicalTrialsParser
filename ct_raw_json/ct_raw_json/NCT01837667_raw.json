LB-100 is a\n      small molecule that in laboratory and animal studies has shown activity when used by itself\n      or together with drugs approved to treat some types of cancer (chemotherapeutic agents).\n      Docetaxel is a drug that has been approved for the treatment of some types of cancer; one of\n      the trade names for docetaxel is Taxotere\u00ae. The study is in 2 parts. Part 1: Patients will\n      receive injections of LB-100. Part 2: Patients will receive injections of LB-100 and\n      docetaxel. This is the first study where LB-100 for Injection will be used in humans."
