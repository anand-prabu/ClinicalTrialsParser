  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving arm and hand function after stroke has been difficult to achieve within the
      rehabilitation service provided in the acute stage often due to the limited resource in
      health care. While spontaneous recovery plateaus after 6 months, the prolonged disability
      affects quality of life and social participation in stroke survivors. This study is aimed at
      improving chronic motor impairment arm and hand impairment by providing the intervention
      with intensive training schedule. This study will compare two types of rehabilitation
      intervention using a randomized controlled trial. Measurements also will be taken on various
      brain functions non-invasively to help discover how each of the intervention strategies
      works differently to repair the brain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After unilateral stroke, incomplete recovery of arm and hand movement is common and its
      long-lasting negative effects include increased care giving costs and overall reduced
      quality of life. Recent evidence suggests that a novel behavioral intervention could improve
      motor functions in sub-acute patients with added benefits in cognitive and brain functions.
      However few studies have addressed whether chronic stage patients can also benefit from the
      intervention and how brain plasticity works over the course of rehabilitation. This study
      will investigate the benefits of two types of intervention methods that are extendable for
      community-based intervention services in the future. It also will examine changes in
      integrity of motions before and after the intervention. Further comparisons between brain
      functions and structure will be made using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), non-invasively. These behavioural and physiological measures will
      inform the mechanisms of stroke recovery and training.
