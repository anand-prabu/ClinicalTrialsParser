Patients without CNS disease at diagnosis,\n      achieving a specified early marrow response profile and M1 marrow status of less than 5%\n      blasts in the bone marrow (regardless of the proportion of mature lymphocytes) by day 28 of\n      induction therapy, and remaining event free with favorable bone marrow status and\n      cytogenetics between day 21 and 28 of consolidation therapy are randomized to one of four\n      treatment arms. Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis are assigned to treatment arm II and\n      undergo cranial irradiation. Patients with any of the following unfavorable bone marrow\n      features and/or unfavorable cytogenetic features are assigned to the augmented treatment\n      regimen by day 21 of induction chemotherapy or at the beginning of consolidation\n      chemotherapy:\n\n      NOTE: All T-cell precursor patients that are not more than 4 months past completion of the\n      delayed intensification phase of therapy should be switched to the augmented regimen as of\n      3/8/2004. These patients may be switched to the augmented regimen. The protocol gives\n      specific instructions according to the phase of therapy the patients are actually in.\n\n        -  Unfavorable marrow status:\n\n             -  M2: 5-25% blasts in bone marrow at day 28 of induction chemotherapy (or at day 14\n                of induction chemotherapy if day 7 status is M3) OR\n\n             -  M3: More than 25% blast cell in bone marrow, regardless of the proportion of\n                mature lymphocytes at day 14 of induction chemotherapy\n\n        -  Unfavorable cytogenetics: Must have 1 of the following:\n\n             -  t(9;22)(q34;q11)\n\n             -  t(4;11)(q21;q23)\n\n             -  Balanced t(1;19)(q23;p13)\n\n             -  Hypodiploidy with less than 45 chromosomes\n\n             -  Other 11q23 translocations involving MLL Patients receive standard induction\n                chemotherapy comprising cytarabine (ARA-C) intrathecally (IT) on day 0 or up to 72\n                hours before day 0; oral dexamethasone (DM) twice daily on days 0-27; vincristine\n                (VCR) IV on days 0, 7, 14, and 21; and pegaspargase (PEG-ASP) intramuscularly (IM)\n                once between days 3-5. Patients without CNS disease at diagnosis receive\n                methotrexate (MTX) IT on days 7 and 28. Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis\n                receive MTX IT on days 7, 14, 21, and 28.\n\n      Patients who have achieved M1 marrow status by day 28 of induction therapy and have\n      favorable early bone marrow response and cytogenetics proceed to standard consolidation\n      therapy once blood counts have recovered. Patients with M3 bone marrow status at day 28 of\n      induction therapy are taken off the protocol. All other patients are assigned to the\n      augmented treatment regimen.\n\n      Beginning on day 28 of induction chemotherapy, patients receive standard consolidation\n      chemotherapy comprising VCR IV on day 0 and oral mercaptopurine (MP) on days 0-27. Patients\n      without CNS disease at diagnosis receive MTX IT on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. Patients with CNS\n      disease at diagnosis receive MTX IT on day 7 and cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 2\n      weeks. Patients with testicular disease receive bilateral testicular radiotherapy 5 days a\n      week for 1 week and then for 3 consecutive days during the next week.\n\n      NOTE: As of 3/8/2004, patients with T-cell disease who did not achieve M1 marrow status by\n      day 14 of induction OR who did not receive augmented induction and/or consolidation\n      (regardless of early marrow status) receive cranial irradiation.\n\n        -  Arm I: Beginning on day 28 of consolidation chemotherapy, patients receive interim\n           maintenance I chemotherapy comprising oral DM twice daily on days 0-4 and 28-32; VCR IV\n           on days 0 and 28; oral MTX on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49; oral MP on days\n           0-49; and MTX IT on day 28.\n\n      Beginning on day 56 of interim maintenance I chemotherapy, patients receive delayed\n      intensification chemotherapy comprising oral DM twice daily on days 0-6 and 14-20; VCR IV\n      and doxorubicin (DOX) IV over 15 minutes to 2 hours on days 0, 7, and 14; PEG-ASP IM on day\n      3; cyclophosphamide (CTX) IV over 20-30 minutes on day 28; oral thioguanine (TG) on days\n      28-41; ARA-C IV or subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 28-31 and 35-38; and MTX IT on days 0\n      and 28.\n\n      Beginning on day 56 of delayed intensification chemotherapy, patients receive interim\n      maintenance II chemotherapy identical to interim maintenance I chemotherapy except patients\n      receive MTX IT on days 0 and 28.\n\n      Beginning on day 56 of interim maintenance II chemotherapy, patients receive maintenance\n      chemotherapy comprising oral DM twice daily on days 0-4, 28-32, and 56-60; VCR IV on days 0,\n      28, and 56; oral MP on days 0-83; oral MTX on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70,\n      and 77; and MTX IT on day 0.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive interim maintenance I chemotherapy, delayed intensification\n           chemotherapy, and interim maintenance II chemotherapy as in arm I.

Patients then receive delayed intensification\n           chemotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive interim maintenance II chemotherapy as in\n           interim maintenance I chemotherapy, but with IV MTX starting at 2/3 of the maximum\n           tolerated dose (MTD) attained in interim maintenance I chemotherapy. Patients then\n           receive maintenance chemotherapy as in arm I.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive interim maintenance I chemotherapy as in arm III, delayed\n           intensification chemotherapy as in arm I, interim maintenance II chemotherapy as in arm\n           III, delayed intensification II chemotherapy as in arm II, and maintenance chemotherapy\n           as in arm I.\n\n        -  Augmented Treatment: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising daunorubicin IV\n           continuously for 48 hours beginning no later than day 21; oral DM twice daily on days\n           14-27; and VCR IV on days 14 and 21. Patients without CNS disease at diagnosis receive\n           MTX IT on days 21 and 35. Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis receive MTX IT on days\n           21 and 28.\n\n      NOTE: Patients with T-cell disease should re-start with augmented consolidation and proceed\n      as per the augmented regimen.\n\n      Beginning on day 35 of induction chemotherapy, patients receive consolidation therapy\n      comprising CTX IV over 20-30 minutes on days 0 and 28; oral MP on days 0-13 and 28-41; ARA-C\n      IV or SC daily on days 0-3, 7-10, 28-31, and 35-38; VCR IV on days 14, 21, 42, and 49; and\n      PEG-ASP IM on days 14 and 42. Patients without CNS disease at diagnosis receive MTX IT on\n      days 7, 14, and 21. Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis receive MTX IT on day 7 and\n      cranial irradiation as in the randomized treatment section. Patients with testicular\n      leukemia receive radiotherapy as in the randomized treatment section.\n\n      Beginning on day 63 of consolidation chemotherapy, patients receive interim maintenance I\n      chemotherapy comprising VCR IV on days 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40; escalating doses of MTX IV on\n      days 10, 20, 30, and 40; PEG-ASP IM on days 1 and 21; and MTX IT on days 0 and 30.\n\n      Beginning on day 56 of interim maintenance I chemotherapy, patients receive delayed\n      intensification I chemotherapy comprising oral DM twice daily on days 0-6 and 14-20; VCR IV\n      on days 0, 7, 14, 42, and 49; DOX IV over 15 minutes to 2 hours on days 0, 7, and 14;\n      PEG-ASP IM on days 3 and 42; CTX IV over 20-30 minutes on day 28; oral TG on days 28-41;\n      ARA-C IV or SC daily on days 28-31 and 35-38; and MTX IT on days 0 and 28.\n\n      NOTE: Patients with T-cell disease who are in interim maintenance I chemotherapy with\n      escalating IV methotrexate should continue this phase and then proceed as per the augmented\n      regimen. If these patients are receiving conventional interim maintenance chemotherapy with\n      oral methotrexate, they should stop and restart the interim maintenance as per the augmented\n      regimen. These patients receive cranial irradiation starting on day 28 of delayed\n      intensification II chemotherapy.\n\n      Beginning on day 56 of delayed intensification I chemotherapy, patients receive interim\n      maintenance II chemotherapy as in interim maintenance I chemotherapy, but with IV MTX\n      starting at 2/3 of the MTD attained in interim maintenance I chemotherapy.\n\n      NOTE: Patients with T-cell disease who are in delayed intensification I chemotherapy proceed\n      with this phase, with the addition of 2 vincristine doses on days 42 and 49 and PEG-ASP on\n      day 42.
