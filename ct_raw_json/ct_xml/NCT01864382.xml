  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stroke as cerebrovascular disease is the leading cause of permanent neurological
      disability and the third death in the Western world. Their affected often have motor and
      sensory disturbances in the form of hemiparesis with a possible influence on the balance be
      altered trunk muscles, important components of postural control. The treatment of stroke,
      covers a wide range of different strategies and approaches physiotherapy, including,
      specific exercises on the trunk called &quot;core stability&quot;, performed by the patient with the
      help and supervision of a physiotherapist specializing in neurology, that are based on
      coordination, motor and proprioceptive work, especially the lumbar-pelvic. The effectiveness
      of these last years has been demonstrated empirically, but until now there is no sufficient
      evidence of the effects of these exercises on sitting balance in respect, and standing up in
      the subacute phase post-stroke patients. To prove the evidence raises a randomized,
      multicenter, blinded and where the evaluator will not participate in the analysis and
      processing is done by intention to treat. Patients will be divided into two groups: control
      (usual physiotherapy center made​​) and experimental (made ​​also 15 minutes workout &quot;core
      stability&quot;). The intervention will have a frequency of 5 days a week for 5 weeks and up to
      12 weeks. The expected effect is that the experimental group patients develop better
      postural control at the trunk and this influences the balance in sitting, standing and
      walking.

      The deterioration in the balance sitting and poor sitting ability, clinical problems are
      common after stroke. These patients show a significant decrease in the performance level of
      the trunk, compared to healthy individuals of the same age and sex and present asymmetry of
      the trunk and pelvis.

      Sitting involves the ability to achieve a variety of objects that are in and out of arm's
      length, as personal daily activities, showering, going to the bathroom and dressing. These
      arm movements, triggering postural adjustments in the muscles of the trunk and lower
      extremities, which anticipated the movement always precede the active movement. This
      anticipative control can be altered in subjects with stroke.

      The trunk seems particularly important for balance, as stabilizes the pelvis and spine. Dean
      et al, (1997; 2007) and Ibrahimi (2010) showed a beneficial effect on functional scope of
      practice tasks, sitting in variables dynamic sitting balance, load weight of the affected
      side and standing. Also in the studies of Howe (2005); Verheyden (2009); Saeys
      (2011);Karthikbabu (2011) and Kumar (2011) with specific exercises for the trunk, favorable
      outcomes were obtained compared with standard treatment. However, these studies with few
      patients and without any monitoring, it needs to be confirmed (what is this study intended)
