            "textblock": "Vast majority of breast cancers arise from ductal epithelium. Ductal cells can be collected\n      through the nipple orifice very early in breast cancer development. The nipple aspirate \ufb02uid\n      (NAF) can be used to identify biomarkers that predict risk of breast cancer. To date, the\n      biomarkers identified in nipple aspirate \ufb02uid (NAF) have limited utility due to the large\n      volume of NAF required for data analysis. Recent studies show intranasal oxytocin's utility\n      in enhancing the yield of nipple aspirate \ufb02uid (NAF) among healthy, non-lactating female\n      patients as well as those at high risk for breast cancer. This capability is crucial for the\n      analysis of various markers associated with breast disease and cancer such as microRNAs. The\n      primary aim of the study is to determine whether the microRNA profile characterization is\n      feasible with the collection of tissue, serum and NAF in patients with in situ and invasive\n      breast cancer. Intranasal oxytocin will be used to enhance \ufb02uid yielding of the NAF."
