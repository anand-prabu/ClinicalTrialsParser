            "textblock": "This is a neuroimaging study of changes in brain function associated with trauma-focused\n      cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT)for abused youth suffering from PTSD.  By scanning\n      patients before and after treatment, the investigators will identify mediators (potential\n      mechanisms) of recovery from PTSD.\n\n      Childhood maltreatment is unfortunately common, and can lead to significant problems in\n      school, emotional difficulties, and physical ailments. Frequently, abused children develop\n      symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as re-experiencing aspects of the\n      trauma, avoiding trauma-related situations, and suffering from chronic hyperarousal.  PTSD\n      can inflict significant stress-related damage on the brain at any age, but may be\n      particularly damaging during developmental periods such as adolescence. Therefore, effective\n      treatments for PTSD in youth are critical, and this depends in part on our ability to\n      understand the neural abnormalities underlying pediatric PTSD, and the brain changes\n      accompanying recovery from PTSD.\n\n      TF-CBT is the \"gold-standard\" treatment for this population however, some patients continue\n      to experience symptoms of PTSD following treatment.  Examining neural changes associated\n      with successful treatment may suggest adjunctive or additional steps to enhance recovery in\n      non-responders or partly responsive patients.\n\n      The investigators will assess brain activation in response to an emotion-related task in 40\n      adolescents with PTSD before and after a 12 week TF-CBT treatment, conducted at Stanford\n      University.  The fidelity of TF-CBT treatment will be assured through ongoing consultation\n      between clinicians and treatment co-creator Judith Cohen, M.D. Neuroimaging analyses will\n      assess patterns of activation associated with response to TF-CBT.  Also, the investigators\n      will scan 30 age-matched female healthy controls recruited from the same community, to\n      compare with patients to identify abnormalities in brain structure and function in the PTSD\n      group.  Controls will be scanned before and after a 12-week interval as well, to allow\n      analyses of test/retest reliability of fMRI measures in this age group."
