The objective was to examine the synergistic\n      effect of vitamin B12 in combination of n-3 PUFA on plasma Hcy, ferritin, and other\n      biochemical markers. In a randomized controlled trial, thirty eligible subjects were\n      randomly divided into three groups, and assigned to receive 1000 \u03bcg of vitamin B12, 2g fish\n      oil, or 1000 \u03bcg vitamin B12 and 2g fish oil respectively for 8 weeks. Plasma phospholipid\n      (PL) fatty acids and biochemical markers were determined. we hypothesize that combination of\n      vitamin B12 and fish oil have synergistic effect on lowering plasma concentrations of Hcy\n      and ferritin."
