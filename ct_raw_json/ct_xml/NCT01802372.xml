  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the World Health
      Organization Package targeted at Cardiovascular (CV) risk assessment and hypertension
      control, delivered by Community Health Nurses as part of Ghana's Community based Health
      Planning and Services program, versus provision of health insurance coverage, on blood
      pressure reduction. Findings from this study will provide policy makers and other
      stakeholders needed information to recommend efficient cost-effective policy with regards to
      comprehensive CV risk reduction in patients with hypertension in low resource settings.
