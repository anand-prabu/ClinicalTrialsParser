  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional recovery following SCI in adults is limited. Improvements in the quality of life
      of affected persons are associated with the recovery of functions that allow independent
      living, for example use of the arms and hands. Rehabilitative training has been shown to aid
      upper limb recovery however, there are likely vast differences in the amount of time
      individuals spend actively training (during rehabilitation sessions in the clinic) and what
      they do in their non-training time (during daily life). The activity, or lack of, during the
      non-training period could interfere (positively or negatively), with the specific training
      in the rehabilitation session. However, there is little information available about this.

      Inertial measurement units are increasingly being used in human movement and rehabilitation
      research. The use of such technology is a promising approach to rapidly and discreetly
      collect objective movement information. The investigators plan to introduce a novel,
      long-term, activity sensor into clinical SCI rehabilitation. The investigators use this
      sensor to precisely measure movement of the upper limb over extended periods of time. Upper
      limb activity recordings from these sensors allow us to detail the amount and duration of
      activity during specific periods of upper limb rehabilitation and recovery.

      The investigators aim is to measure upper limb activity. The investigators aim to track
      changes in the activity of the upper limb during recovery and rehabilitation in patients
      with cervical SCI. The recordings from this activity sensor will provide a more detailed
      understanding of how everyday upper limb activity contributes to functional recovery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Tetraplegic and paraplegic subjects.

          -  Males and females aged 18 or older.

          -  Acute (defined here as &lt;90 days after admission of SCI) for the longitudinal
             follow-up study, as well as chronic (defined here as &gt;90 days after admission of SCI)
             for the cross-sectional study, all levels of injury, complete and incomplete,
             traumatic and non-traumatic injuries.

          -  Good enough cognitive ability to be able to follow simple verbal instructions.

          -  Signed informed consent before study onset.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A neurological disease other than SCI, which is expected to affect the upper limb
             function, i.e. plexus paresis.

          -  An orthopaedic or rheumatologic disease, e.g. osteoarthritis, which is expected to
             affect the upper limb function.

          -  Pre-morbid on-going major depression or psychosis.
