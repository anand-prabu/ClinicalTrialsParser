Although general risk factors for infection have been\n      identified, there is still a need to identify specific risk factors for colorectal surgery\n      patients, to try to reduce these numbers. The technique and materials used for wound closure\n      have been considered as interesting variables for study.\n\n      Main question of our study: is subcuticular (reabsorbable, continuous) suture better than\n      skin staples for reducing wound SSIs in colorectal surgery? The study is sponsored by the\n      Surgical Infection Society Europe, and was awarded the SIS-E Fellowship for young\n      investigators (2013)"
