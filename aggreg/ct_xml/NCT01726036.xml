  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two commonly used circumcision clamps (Gomco and
      Mogen) to see which results in less neonatal pain.

      Objective: To compare pain levels assessed by salivary cortisol and standardized neonatal
      pain scale among the two most common infant circumcision techniques in uncomplicated
      pregnancies after a thorough resident-wide education curriculum under attending physician
      supervision.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the operative time, complication rates such as
      infection and bleeding and short term outcomes including need for re-circumcision among
      treatment groups.

      Hypothesis: The Mogen technique of circumcision is less painful, faster, and associated with
      less bleeding for newborns when compared to the Gomco technique after a resident
      circumcision standard teaching curriculum.
