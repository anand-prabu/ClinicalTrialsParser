      Stage 1:First line therapy Sequential therapy of S1+Docetaxel followed by S1 is superior to
      concomitant S1+Docetaxel in the safety and clinical efficiency.

      Stage 2:Second line therapy To explore the feasibility of single drug(S1) maintenance
      treatment for advanced gastric cancer.
