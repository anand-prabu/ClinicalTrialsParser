Recently, a new\n      microscopic technic (Intracytoplasmic Morphologically Selected Sperm Injection-IMSI) allows\n      to make this choice at a 6000x magnification, which permits to identify sperm abnormalities\n      such as nuclear vacuoles not seen in conventional ICSI. This selection may improve ICSI\n      outcome. However only few data from randomised trials, have been published and the\n      indications of IMSI remain to be identified. The present study aims to evaluate the\n      efficiency and the indications of IMSI through a multicentric randomised trial. The patients\n      enrolled in the study must present a male infertility and will have complete sperm\n      examination, including morphology, DNA fragmentation and nuclear immaturity. The main\n      endpoint will be the percentage of delivery."
