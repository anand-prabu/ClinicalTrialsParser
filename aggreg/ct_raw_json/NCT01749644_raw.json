With time, the infection with Pseudomonas becomes chronic and very difficult to\n      eradicate. The standard treatment of chronic Pseudomonas infection is inhaled Tobramycin\n      which is given every other month.. Inhalation of Tobramycin was proven as an effective\n      treatment that improves the respiratory function and reduces the concentration of bacteria\n      in the sputum. However,  inhaled treatment lasts between 15 to 30 minutes twice a day and\n      therefore adherence is a major problem. The effect of switching from inhalation treatment to\n      inhaler treatment on patient's adherence and quality of life has not been studied."
