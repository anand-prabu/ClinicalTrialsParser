Anesthesia for a\n      cesarean delivery frequently causes the patient to shiver and their arm to shake, and\n      sometimes to the extent that blood pressure cannot be measured. A cuff placed on the wrist\n      may be more effective when a patient is shivering because their lower arm moves less and can\n      be more easily stabilized. We will be taking simultaneous blood pressure measurements both\n      just before and during cesarean deliveries in order to compare blood pressure at the upper\n      arm versus the wrist."

            "textblock": "Upper arm non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement is the most commonly accepted\n      method of blood pressure (BP) monitoring. During a cesarean delivery it may be challenging\n      to obtain an accurate measurement from the automated devices in over 50% of the attempts due\n      to arm movement.1 Patients may voluntarily move their arm, but more often neuraxial (spinal,\n      epidural, combined spinal-epidural) anesthesia is known to induce shivering that causes the\n      patient's arm to shake.2 To eliminate the effect of movement of the upper arm, NIBP has been\n      tested on the leg because it is immobilized during neuraxial anesthesia. However, studies\n      monitoring NIBP on an ankle or a calf were unable to accurately detect changes (increase or\n      decrease) in blood pressure in patients undergoing a cesarean delivery.3,4 It seems\n      clinically reasonable that in the case of a shivering patient, the forearm, with less muscle\n      mass, would shake less and could be stabilized more easily than the upper arm (stabilizing\n      the forearm is easily done by holding the patient's hand with a light pressure on the arm\n      rest). Therefore, positioning an NIBP cuff on the forearm (near the wrist) may be useful to\n      obtain an accurate blood pressure measurement in shivering patients.\n\n      Previous studies have found that forearm BP overestimates blood pressure measured at the\n      upper arm in a variety of clinical settings and patient populations under static (patient at\n      rest, not submitted to an intervention that might alter BP) circumstances.5-8  It is unknown\n      whether this overestimation is clinically relevant when blood pressure change occurs\n      rapidly, such as during a cesarean delivery. During neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean\n      delivery, it is important for the anesthesiologist to know both absolute values and\n      clinically significant changes in blood pressure to determine their treatment. The detection\n      of dynamic changes in blood pressure (as when the patient is submitted to an intervention\n      that might alter BP per se, e.g. neuraxial anesthesia) has been studied in obstetric\n      patients. Nevertheless, either due to the location where the BP cuff was placed4 (as on the\n      lower limb with interference of the aorto-caval compression) or to the technology used to\n      measure blood pressure,9 (the penaz technology was not consistent with oscillometric\n      technology in a previous study) the forearm blood pressure was not comparable to upper arm\n      blood pressure when measured using an oscillometric monitor.\n\n      This study will compare the upper arm (the current gold-standard) and the forearm NIBP\n      measurements in patients undergoing an elective cesarean delivery under subarachnoid\n      anesthesia. We hypothesize that the forearm systolic BP measurement values will be within\n      10% (lower or higher) of the systolic BP values measured in the upper arm at the same\n      time-points"
