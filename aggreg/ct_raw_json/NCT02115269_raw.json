One of key findings of The Atlas of Headache Disorders prepared by World Health\n      Organization (WHO) is: headache disorders, including migraine and tension-type headache\n      (TTH), are among the most prevalent disorders of mankind. The fixed combination of\n      indomethacin, prochlorperazine and caffeine (IndoProCaf) showed efficacy and safety in acute\n      treatment of migraine and episodic tension-type headache attacks. IndoProCaf (Difmetre\u00ae) is\n      widely used in common daily practice only in Italy from early 1970s, is available at the\n      Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) pharmaceutical market now. There are limited data\n      regarding IndoProCaf usage from post-marketing settings. This will be a first post-marketing\n      observational study which aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and patients' satisfaction of\n      primary headaches acute treatment in routine clinical settings in Ukraine and Kazakhstan."
