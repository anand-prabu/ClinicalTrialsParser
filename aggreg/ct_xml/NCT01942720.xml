    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the responsiveness of VCE in the assessment of mucosal
      inflammation after 6 months of treatment with either an Immunomodulator (IMM) and\or
      biological drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center (up to 15 sites) study which aims to assess the ability
      of VCE (Video capsule endoscopy) to detect change in the severity of the small bowel mucosal
      disease activity in CD subjects after 6 months of treatment with either an Immunomodulator
      (IMM) and\ or biological drug.

      Up to 75 subjects will participate in this study. An interim analysis will be done after
      study completion with 20 subjects. All subjects to be enrolled in this study will be
      pediatric and\or adult subjects with Crohn's disease who will be treated with an
      Immunomodulator and/or a biological treatment based on standard clinical evaluation

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject ages 2-75 years, inclusive

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of known Crohn disease

          3. Referred to standard-of-care ileocolonoscopy (up to 4 weeks before the CE procedure)

          4. Subjects with a plan to be treated with an immunomodulator and/or a biologic
             medication following the ileocolonoscopy exam including any of the following:

               1. modification of dose or frequency of current therapy

               2. addition of a new therapy

               3. change to a different therapy within-class or out-of-class

          5. Subject has active terminal ileal disease proven by capsule or ileocolonoscopy
             procedure (note that subjects with colonic disease or other disease locations can be
             enrolled as long as they also have terminal ileal disease)

          6. Proven patency by the Agile capsule or another approach deemed clinically acceptable
             by the investigator, e.g. CT enterography, MRE, performed within the 90 days prior to
             enrollment.

          7. Subject or parent agrees to sign consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:

          1. Subjects with change in IBD drug therapy between the baseline ileocolonoscopy and VCE

          2. Subjects with a history of prior ileocecectomy, Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis (IPAA)
             and J pouch or an ostomy

          3. Stricture seen on radiological exam.

          4. Indeterminate Colitis

          9. Suspected GI stricture, followed by PillCamÂ® Patency study or other imaging study
             that could not prove patency of the GI tract.

         10. Subject is expected to undergo MRI examination within 7 days after ingestion of the
             capsule.

         11. Subjects with known or suspected delayed gastric emptying

         12. Subjects with known or suspected delayed Small bowel motility

             of study

         18. Subject suffers from a life threatening condition.

         19. Subject with a history or clinical evidence of renal disease and/or previous
             clinically significant laboratory abnormalities of renal function parameters.

         20. Subject suffers from any condition, such as swallowing problems, which precludes
             compliance with study and/or device instructions.
