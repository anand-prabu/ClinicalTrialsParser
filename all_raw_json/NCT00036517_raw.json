Severe diarrhea, unfortunately, is a side effect of such treatment.\n      Preclinical studies have indicated that the botanical drug PHY906 can reduce such diarrhea\n      without compromising the effectiveness of the chemotherapy.  The primary purpose of this\n      clinical study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and minimum effective dose of PHY906\n      when administered in conjunction with the Saltz regimen."

PHY906 has been shown to reduce the severity\n      of CPT-11\u2013induced toxicity without compromising antitumor efficacy in in vivo animal models.\n      Additionally, there has been a long historical experience in the Far East demonstrating\n      safety of PHY906 in humans. Thus, we are conducting this double-blind, placebo-controlled\n      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PHY906.  This dose escalation study will\n      also examine the effect of PHY906 (1.2, 2.4, and 3.6 g/day) on the pharmacokinetics of\n      CPT-11 and 5-FU after concomitant administration with CPT-11, 5-FU, and LV, and on the\n      severity of CPT-11\u2013induced toxicities such as diarrhea."
