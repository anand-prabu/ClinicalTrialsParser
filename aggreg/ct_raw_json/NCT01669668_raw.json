This will be determined\n             preoperatively and confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.\n\n          -  Liver function of Child-Pugh class A or B\n\n          -  Tumor(s) must be more than 2 cm away from of major biliary duct or major blood vessel\n             defined as the main portal vein and its right and left primary branches and the first\n             1 cm of the secondary branches of the common hepatic duct and its right and left\n             primary branches or the first 1 cm of its secondary branches.\n\n          -  Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Hepatic tumor(s) with satellite lesions.  A satellite lesion is defined as a tumor\n             which is within 2 cm of the tumor being assessed for treatment and which has a\n             diameter of less than 33% of the diameter of the tumor being assessed for treatment.\n\n          -  Evidence of metastatic/extrahepatic disease based on abdominal and chest CT performed\n             within 4 weeks of the procedure.\n\n          -  Extrahepatic disease upon laparoscopy performed at the time of RFA.  If extrahepatic\n             disease is discovered at this laparoscopy, RFA will not be performed, and the patient\n             will be considered ineligible for this study and will be replaced.\n\n          -  Pregnancy.  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test\n             prior to enrollment in the study.\n\n          -  Significant portal hypertension based on evidence of esophageal varices or ascites.\n             Minimal portal hypertension or ascites will not be an exclusion criterion.\n\n          -  Previous history of HCC or any other non-cutaneous malignancy.\n\n        Patients who are found to be ineligible due to intraoperative findings will be recorded as\n        to the cause of ineligibility.
