      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of quinacrine dihydrochloride
      when given together with erlotinib hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating
      patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as quinacrine dihydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      erlotinib hydrochloride together with quinacrine dihydrochloride may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of erlotinib (erlotinib
      hydrochloride) and quinacrine (quinacrine dihydrochloride) in patients with advanced
      non-small-cell lung cancer. (Phase I) II. To determine the recommended phase II doses of the
      combination of erlotinib and quinacrine in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung
      cancer. (Phase I) III. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of erlotinib and
      quinacrine combination or erlotinib alone in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung
      cancer. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the dose limiting toxicity of the erlotinib and quinacrine combination.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the erlotinib and quinacrine combination.

      III. To determine objective response rate (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]) and
      clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+ stable disease [SD]) of the erlotinib and quinacrine
      combination and erlotinib alone.

      IV. To estimate overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine change in nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
      (NF-κB) related genes in the pre and post treatment biopsy samples as a pharmacodynamic
      marker of treatment with quinacrine.

      II. To correlate expression of NF-κB related proteins in the pre-treatment tissue with
      clinical activity of quinacrine and erlotinib combination.

      III. To measure circulating tumor cells and correlate with response and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of quinacrine dihydrochloride followed by
      a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO)daily on days 1-28 and
      quinacrine dihydrochloride PO thrice daily (TID) on days, 1-7 and PO daily from days 8-28.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO and quinacrine dihydrochloride PO thrice
      daily (TID) on days, 1-7 and PO daily from days 8-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women and adults of reproductive potential not employing an
             effective method of birth control are excluded from this study because quinacrine is
             category N agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; these
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients with previously known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
             hepatitis B and C are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
