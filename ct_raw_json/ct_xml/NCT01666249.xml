  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this trial is that the test drug (KamRho-D ® - T) is not inferior to the
      comparator drug (Rhophylac ® - C) for immunization of Rh negative mothers at risk of
      sensitization. The primary aim is to evaluate the clinical non-inferiority of the test drug
      (KamRho-D ® - Panamerican) compared to the comparator drug (Rhophylac ® - CSL Behring) after
      passive immunization in Rh-negative mothers, negative indirect Coombs, whose baby is Rh
      positive, through the incidence of non positivization of the indirect Coombs test 06 months
      after delivery. The secondary objective is to assess aspects of drug safety, such as: type,
      frequency and intensity of adverse events between groups.
