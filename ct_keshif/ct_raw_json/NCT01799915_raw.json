            "textblock": "Studying primary autonomic disorders poses special researches challenges, primarily because\n      these disorders are rare and affect a small number of patients. Because the medical\n      literature often consists of individual case reports or small case series, good clinical\n      descriptions of the features and clinical evolution of many rare autonomic diseases are\n      lacking. The Autonomic Disorders Consortium was established with the objective of combining\n      the medical expertise of leading autonomic sites within the United States to develop a\n      clearer understanding of primary autonomic disorders, with the hope of developing new\n      treatments and providing better guidance and recommendations for patient care to the medical\n      community.\n\n      The first purpose of this project is to create a database that will serve as a phenotyping\n      core. We will use a comprehensive, integrated approach that will combine standardized\n      clinical, physiological and biochemical studies to characterize the autonomic phenotypes of\n      rare autonomic disorders, including both disorders already known and others still\n      undiscovered.  Specifically, we will screen patients with orthostatic intolerance and\n      conduct careful autonomic, medical and neurological evaluations to characterize the features\n      of the rare autonomic disorders. This database will also allow us to identify adequate\n      candidates for the therapeutic trials and natural history study of the Autonomic RDCRC.\n\n      The second purpose of this project is to identify patients with neurogenic orthostatic\n      hypotension that will be followed in a longitudinal observational study with yearly visits\n      to map the natural history of the different types of primary autonomic failure and better\n      characterize how these diseases evolve over time. As part of the natural history study, we\n      will determine whether the neurodegenerative process always damages neurons in the brain\n      (resulting in a movement disorder and/or signs of dementia) or can, in certain cases, remain\n      confined to the autonomic neurons outside the brain. We will also develop biological markers\n      that can distinguish between the different disorders that cause chronic autonomic failure.\n\n      Study Hypothesis: There are a number of unclassified autonomic disorders yet to be\n      discovered. There is a group of patients with a neurodegenerative disorder who have\n      autonomic failure but do not develop a movement disorder or cognitive problems. These\n      patients may have some genetic \"advantage\" that protects their brain from progressive\n      neuronal damage.\n\n      Comparison(s): Based on the final diagnosis established after 5 years, we will compare\n      disease biomarkers in patients with various different types of autonomic disorders in order\n      to determine their predictive value.\n\n      2. Objective and Research Questions\n\n      SPECIFIC AIM 1. THE FIRST SPECIFIC AIM IS TO CREATE A PHENOTYPING DATABASE TO DEFINE THE\n      CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PRIMARY AUTONOMIC DISORDERS.  The overall goal of specific aim 1\n      is to conduct detailed standardized autonomic, clinical and neurological evaluations to\n      create a phenotyping database that will define the clinical characteristics of the different\n      autonomic disorders that are associated with orthostatic intolerance.  We also hope to\n      discover novel types of rare autonomic disorders, as we have done in the past with\n      dopamine-beta-hydroxylase deficiency, norepinephrine transporter deficiency and autoimmune\n      autonomic ganglionopathy. To avoid duplication of efforts, the phenotyping database will\n      also function as an enrollment database that will identify patients who are eligible for\n      inclusion in the natural history study of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and therapeutic\n      clinical trials that will be conducted in collaboration with other members of our Autonomic\n      RDCRC.\n\n      SPECIFIC AIM 2. THE SECOND SPECIFIC AIM IS TO DETERMINE THE NATURAL HISTORY OF NEUROGENIC\n      ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION AND IDENTIFY PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS OF AUTONOMIC DISORDERS. The\n      second specific aim will focus exclusively on patients with neurogenic orthostatic\n      hypotension using a longitudinal observational study that will define the natural history of\n      chronic autonomic failure. To determine whether autonomic function progressively worsens\n      over time in patients with isolated autonomic failure, we will measure blood pressure and\n      heart rate responses to a battery of standardized autonomic function tests at yearly office\n      visits. To determine which patients with primary autonomic failure develop end-organ target\n      damage we will monitor organ function with a series of routine clinical tests, including\n      creatinine clearance. We will also define the prevalence of sleep disorders such as REM\n      behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome and sleep apnea (obstructive or central) using\n      questionnaires and sleep studies in selected patients. In addition, the natural history\n      study will test the hypothesis that there is a group of patients with primary autonomic\n      failure in whom the accumulation of alpha synuclein and the neurodegenerative process\n      remains confined to the peripheral autonomic nervous system and does not develop into a\n      motor or cognitive disorder. By banking DNA and looking at the genes that may promote\n      neuronal sprouting or impede alpha synuclein aggregation, we will ascertain whether patients\n      with the pure autonomic failure (PAF) phenotype have some genetic \"neuro-protective\"\n      advantage that prevents the disorder from spreading to the striatal or other cortical\n      structures. Within the natural history project we will also develop predictive biomarkers\n      that can distinguish between the different types of autonomic failure. After baseline\n      phenotyping, selected patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension will undergo a series\n      of biomarker measurements. At the end of the 5-year follow-up a final diagnosis will be\n      established and based on this diagnosis, we will determine which biomarkers have the best\n      predictive value and are the most useful in the differential diagnosis of patients with PAF\n      from those with early (i.e., \"pre-motor\") MSA, PD or autonomic failure as a result of\n      another disorder."
