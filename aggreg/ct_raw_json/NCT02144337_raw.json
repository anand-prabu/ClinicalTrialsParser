The STAK programme promotes physical activity in children who have a chronic\n      condition, low levels of physical activity, are overweight or who lack confidence to take\n      part in physical activity. The intervention involves an Activity Diary, circuit training,\n      pedometer step  counting, daily physical activity monitoring and goal setting to promote\n      long-term increases in physical activity and its associated health benefits. This randomised\n      single-centre feasibility study will test whether the STAK programme is feasible for\n      children with T1DM, in terms of acceptability, attractiveness and compliance and a\n      qualitative process evaluation will aid the assessment of feasibility."
