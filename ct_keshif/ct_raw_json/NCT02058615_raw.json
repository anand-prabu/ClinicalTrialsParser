MaTT is a website based application that is designed to help male spouses of women with breast cancer to increase their awareness of the transitions and experiences they have as a husband and caregiver as well as to stay organized and seek help and resources as needed. To do so it consists of six sections: about me; common changes to expect; frequently asked questions; resources; calendar; and, important health information. These sections contain activities and exercises, as well as fillable templates (i.e., resources, calendar) that users can download at their convenience, from their home computer, tablet, or smart phone. They will be asked to use the MaTT for one month."

The\n      specific aims are to:  a) evaluate the Toolkit for ease of use, acceptability, and\n      feasibility, and; b) collect preliminary data to determine potential effectiveness of the\n      Toolkit in increasing hope, general self-efficacy and quality of life, and its potential\n      effectiveness in decreasing guilt scores for male partners of women with breast cancer\n      (stages 1-3)."
