  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess how effective starting buprenorphine treatment of
      opioid dependence directly on the buprenorphine/naloxone combination OX219 is, compared to
      starting treatment on buprenorphine only. The hypothesis is that starting directly on OX219
      works equally well (e.g. not significantly worse) as starting on buprenorphine only and
      switching to OX219 on day 3.

      Patients will be screened and eligible patients will be randomized within 0-14 days after
      screening, and followed for 28 days of treatment. Effectiveness of treatment will be
      assessed, including:

        -  How long patients retain in treatment

        -  Assessment of opioid withdrawal symptoms

        -  Assessment of cravings for opioids

        -  Assessment of urine drug screens negative for opioids
