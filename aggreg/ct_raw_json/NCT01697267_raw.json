            "textblock": "Rituximab is now established as an effective drug for  anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\n      (ANCA) vasculitis following major European and US trials reported in 2010. After a time, its\n      effect wears off and the disease can return. This occurs in at least half of patients within\n      2 years of receiving Rituximab. A preliminary study in Cambridge has suggested that\n      repeating rituximab every six months stops the disease returning and is safe.\n\n      The RITAZAREM trial will find out whether repeating rituximab stops vasculitis returning and\n      whether it works better than the older treatments, azathioprine or methotrexate. It will\n      also tell us how long patients remain well after the repeated rituximab treatments are\n      stopped, and if repeated rituximab is safe. We should also learn useful information about\n      the effects of rituximab on quality of life and economic measures. The trial results will\n      help decide the best treatment for future patients who have their vasculitis initially\n      treated with rituximab.\n\n      RITAZAREM aims to recruit patients with established ANCA vasculitis whose disease has come\n      back 'relapsing vasculitis'. All patients will be treated with rituximab and steroids and we\n      anticipate that most will respond well. If their disease is under reasonable control after\n      four months, further treatment with either rituximab (a single dose ever four months for two\n      years) or azathioprine tablets will be chosen randomly. The patients in the rituximab and\n      azathioprine groups will then be compared. Patients will be in the trial for four years.\n\n      The study has been designed by members of the European Vasculitis Study group (EUVAS) and\n      the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC). It will include 190 participants from 30\n      hospitals in Europe, the USA, Australia and Mexico.\n\n      RITAZAREM is being funded by Arthritis Research UK, the U.S. National Institutes of Health\n      and by Roche/Genentech."
