After returning home, stroke patients face new\n      challenges and also need to assume more responsibility for daily activities. Without\n      continuing rehabilitation training or proper support, the patients can easily fall into a\n      sedentary lifestyle and lead to declines in functional ability.However, providing home-based\n      exercise by therapists directly would increase the health care cost and may not be practical\n      for chronic stroke patients. Hence, the objective of the present study was to determine\n      whether a caregiver-mediated, home-based intervention program is effective for improving\n      stroke patients' functional ability and social participation."
