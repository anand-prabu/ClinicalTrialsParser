    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, and controlled clinical study over
      6 months of treatment to evaluate the metabolic and clinical efficacy as well as the safety
      of DLBS3233 alone, metformin and combination of both, in improving metabolic and
      reproductive parameters.

    <textblock>
      There will be 3 groups of treatment (N = 186), each consist of 62 subjects, as the
      following:

        -  Treatment I : DLBS3233 100 mg once daily

        -  Treatment II : Metformin XR 750 mg twice daily

        -  Treatment III : DLBS3233 100 mg once daily and Metformin XR 750 mg twice daily.

      Laboratory examination to evaluate metabolic efficacy parameters will be performed at
      baseline, Month 3rd, and end of study (Month 6th).

      Clinical and laboratory examination to evaluate the reproductive efficacy parameters using
      trans-vaginal USG and biomarkers (such as reproductive hormones) will be performed at
      baseline to the end of study.

      Safety examination will be performed at baseline and end of study. Occurrence of adverse
      event will be observed along the study conduct.
