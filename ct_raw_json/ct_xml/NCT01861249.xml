      The total duration of study period is 68 weeks, broken down as follows:

        -  1 week for screening (Week 8 assessment in the ACT12688 study)

        -  62 weeks for treatment

        -  6 weeks for the post treatment safety follow-up A post-study long term safety follow-up
           will be performed in the form of a phone interview at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months from
           the last administration of the study medication.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) who were previously randomized and have
             completed the 8-week treatment in ACT12688 study with an acceptable safety profile.
             Patients who for administrative reasons could not be enrolled in the LTS12593 study
             right after completion of the 8-week treatment in the ACT12688 study must be enrolled
             within 3 months from the end of the ACT12688 study

          -  Signed written informed consent for Study LTS12593

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patient with any adverse event leading to study drug (active or placebo) treatment
             discontinuation from ACT12688 study.

          -  Patient with any abnormalities or adverse events that per investigator judgment would
             adversely affect patient's participation in the long-term extension study.

          -  Use of any immunosuppressant (if patient is on immunosuppressant he or she must
             discontinue immunosuppressant before starting the LTS12593).

          -  If the patient started biological treatment for UC while waiting to be enrolled in
             the LTS12593, then he or she must stop the biological treatment and must have 8 weeks
             of wash out period before starting treatment with SAR339658 (only anti-TNFs are
             allowed)

          -  Patients exposed to an anti-integrin or any investigational drug administered after
             the end of treatment in ACT12688

          -  Positive pregnancy test

          -  Breast feeding woman

          -  Women of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective contraceptive
             method of birth control and/or who are unwilling and unable to be tested for
             pregnancy.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
