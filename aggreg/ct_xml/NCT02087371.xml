  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional, observational study of a cohort with
      a biological plasma and urine samples collection for the study of prognosis factors of
      cardiac complications after liver transplantation
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is the standard treatment for chronic or acute hepatic
      insufficiency with 87% of one-year survival. Cardiovascular complications are common after
      LT with an incidence at 6 months ranging between 25 and 50 %. These complications are
      associated with significant morbidity and represents the third cause of post LT mortality.
      Myocardial perfusion imaging or stress echocardiography, used for preoperative
      cardiovascular evaluation, are not enough efficient to predict the risk of post LT
      cardiovascular complications. However, to improve the prediction capacity of cardiovascular
      disease is fundamental in order to better select the candidates for LT or to develop
      preventive strategies. Such a strategy could reduce the morbidity and mortality from
      cardiovascular diseases after LT and improve the results of LT. Cardiovascular biomarkers
      such as troponin or natriuretic peptide are known to be predictive factors of postoperative
      cardiovascular complications in non cardiac surgery. The use of biomarkers in combination
      with conventional tests could improve the preoperative prediction of post LT cardiovascular
      complications.

      Hypothesis: The preoperative biomarkers dosage could improve the prediction of
      cardiovascular complications occurring in the year after LT.
