      To  record diaphragm excursion in brainstem lesion patients with dysphagia during coughing
      and compare them to those with non-brainstem lesion patients with dysphasia and  those with
      no dysphagia at a university affiliated rehabilitation department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous work has shown that stroke patients with dysphagia have impaired diaphragm
      excursion in comparison to those with no dysphagia.  It has been postulated that respiratory
      and cough function are primarily controlled by respiratory and swallowing centers located in
      the brainstem.We postulated that those with brainstem lesions would have more impaired cough
      and respiratory function than those with non-brainstem lesions.

      However there has been no studies whether those with brainstem lesion have more impaired
      cough function and decreased diaphragm excursion than those with non-brainstem lesions.
