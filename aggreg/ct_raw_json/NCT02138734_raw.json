The anti-tumor activity of\n      BCG+ALT-803 will also be assessed. In addition, the study will characterize the molecular,\n      immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic profile of BCG+ALT-803.\n\n      The study includes a dose escalation phase (Phase Ib) and a dose expansion phase (Phase II).\n      The dose escalation phase is concluded when the MTD is determined. A dose level (RD) will be\n      designated for the expansion phase of the study. The expansion phase consists of a\n      noncomparative randomized design of patients receiving ALT-803 at the RD level in\n      combination with BCG  or BCG alone."
