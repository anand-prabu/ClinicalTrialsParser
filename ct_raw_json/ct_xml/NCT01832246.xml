  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The accurate prediction of depth of tumor invasion in early gastric cancer is essential for
      the proper selection of candidates for endoscopic resection. Conventional endoscopy and
      endoscopic ultrasonography have been useful diagnostic method for depth of invasion in early
      gastric cancer. However, there has been no prospective comparative study on the accuracy
      between the 2 methods. Therefore, the investigators prospectively compare the accuracy
      between the 2 methods regarding prediction of depth of invasion.
