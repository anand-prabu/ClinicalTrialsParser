            "textblock": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) within the thalamocortical\n      basal ganglion (BG) complex is an effective neurosurgical approach for treating motor\n      symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, because the nature of its underlying\n      mechanisms and clinical effects are not fully understood, precision targeting, decreasing\n      adverse effects, and improving clinical outcomes represent major clinical and scientific\n      challenges in PD and other disorders treated by DBS. Our goal is to investigate the\n      inter-relationships between site-specific neural activation and clinical outcomes during STN\n      DBS. To do so, we will perform non-invasive functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to\n      investigate DBS-mediated activation of thalamocortical BG network circuitry. Our proposed\n      protocol involves the addition of intraoperative fMRI to the standard DBS protocol in order\n      to determine the major sites of activation in the thalamocortical BG complex during\n      application of clinically effective DBS to the dorsal and ventral regions of the STN (dSTN\n      and ventral subthalamic nucleus (vSTN), respectively). Patients will undergo clinical\n      assessment using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to determine the\n      relative efficacy of dSTN and vSTN DBS, applied during the fMRI and at every standard follow\n      visit post-surgery. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify fMRI-activated brain regions by\n      vSTN and dSTN DBS in PD patients and (2) correlate fMRI activation with clinical outcomes\n      (UPDRS) and side effects. With the goal of improving DBS electrode targeting for optimal and\n      reproducible clinical outcomes, these experiments will be the first attempt to relate\n      site-specific DBS with functional in vivo imaging data and quantitative longitudinal\n      clinical outcome measures in PD patients."
