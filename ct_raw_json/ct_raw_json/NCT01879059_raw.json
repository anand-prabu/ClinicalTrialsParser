            "textblock": "The effects of physical inactivity on variations in blood glucose and vascular health are\n      not fully understood.  The purpose of this study is to determine if an acute transition from\n      physical activity to inactivity alters blood glucose homeostasis and measures of vascular\n      health. Specifically, the investigators wish to examine in healthy, lean physically active\n      individuals (obtaining greater than 10,000 steps/day) if decreasing physical activity\n      (obtaining less than 5,000 steps/day) will alter blood flow following a meal, glycemic\n      control, and a marker of vascular health.  Since the investigators know that high blood\n      glucose or large changes in blood glucose following a meal is associated with decreased\n      vascular health, the investigators also wish to determine if the changes in vascular health\n      occur before or after changes in blood glucose following a meal.  Furthermore, the\n      investigators wish to examine if a one day return to physical activity (obtaining >10,000\n      steps/day) can restore the detrimental effects on glycemic control, vascular health, and\n      blood flow following a meal.  The investigators anticipate that physical inactivity will\n      decrease glycemic control, vascular health, and blood flow following a meal.  Further, the\n      investigators anticipate that with physical inactivity, the investigators will see\n      impairments in glycemic control before the investigators see impairments in vascular health.\n       Finally, the investigators expect that a one day return to physical activity will restore\n      glycemic control, vascular health, and blood flow following a meal back to pre-inactivity\n      levels."
