  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an internet-based contingency
      management program for smoking cessation in persons who are homeless. Thirty homeless
      smokers will be enrolled in the study.  Participants will receive payment based on their own
      low carbon monoxide readings, which indicate being quit from smoking. Participants will be
      prescribed nicotine replacement (patches and either gum or lozenge)and bupropion. All
      participants will receive a four sessions of smoking cessation counseling, and will be
      trained to perform carbon monoxide monitoring with a device provided by the study. They will
      also be provided with a mobile phone equipped with a video camera, and will use this
      equipment at home to monitor their carbon monoxide . Participants will record videos of
      themselves taking a carbon monoxide reading and displaying the results, and will upload the
      videos to a secured website that is only accessible by the research team members and the
      participant. Payment will be based on providing carbon monoxide readings that indicate
      abstinence.

      The study is designed to address the following aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate whether it is feasible to use internet-based contingency
      management for helping smokers who are homeless stop smoking.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate how effective internet-based contingency managementis on
      decreasing smoking in smokers who are homeless.
