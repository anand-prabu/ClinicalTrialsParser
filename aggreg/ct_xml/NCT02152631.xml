        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participants must have confirmed diagnosis of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer
             (NSCLC) according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Handbook.

          -  Determined to have detectable mutations in codons 12 or 13 of the KRAS oncogene by an
             investigational assay at the study JPBK central laboratory.

          -  The participant must have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy (with or
             without maintenance therapy)  AND have received one other prior chemotherapy for
             advanced and/or metastatic disease OR is judged by the physician as ineligible for
             further standard second-line chemotherapy.

          -  Have measureable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST 1.1).

          -  Have a performance status (PS) of 0 to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) scale.

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer (including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and investigational therapy) for at least 21 days for
             myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents prior to receiving
             study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any
             indication within 14 or 21 days of the initial dose of study drug for a
             nonmyelosuppressive or myelosuppressive agent, respectively.

          -  Have a personal history of any of the following conditions: presyncope or syncope of
             either unexplained or cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia (including but
             not limited to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden
             cardiac arrest.

          -  Have the presence of unstable central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. History of CNS
             metastasis or stable CNS metastases are allowed (no longer requiring active therapy
             such as steroid medications).  Participants with a history of CNS metastases must
             have a brain scan (for example, magnetic resonance imaging) within 28 days of
             randomization to document stability, even if there have been no changes in symptoms.
