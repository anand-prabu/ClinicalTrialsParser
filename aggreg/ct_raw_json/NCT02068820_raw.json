The following\n      three specific aims would be addressed in this research proposal:\n\n      Specific Aim 1: To determine the ability of mapping bilaterally pelvic SLN in women with\n      endometrial cancer undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic staging comparing two different\n      methods (i.e., comparing the combination of colorimetric analysis-ISB dye + fluorescence\n      imaging-ICG dye vs. colorimetric analysis-ISB dye alone).\n\n      Specific Aim 2: To estimate the negative predictive value (NPV) of pelvic SLN in endometrial\n      cancer with respect to predicting nodal metastasis.\n\n      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the ability of sentinel lymph nodes to increase the detection of\n      metastatic disease through ultra-sectioning and immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining by\n      comparing IHC results and standard hematoxolin and eosin (H&E) results."
