Thereafter, the participant will perform meditation by following a series of MM recordings during the first half of each hemodialysis session for the next 4 to 8 weeks.The MM instructor will also meet with the participants weekly to provide continued instruction. Participants will also be encouraged to perform MM using the MP3 player at home, on non-dialysis days, and asked to keep a log of these sessions."

Monitoring of adherence will be same as above."

Those with paradoxical increases in blood pressure (BP) during\n      hemodialysis (HD), defined as intradialytic hypertension (IDH), are at even greater risk of\n      cardiovascular mortality. This study seeks to determine the mechanisms that underlie IDH,\n      and whether mindfulness meditation might improve BP during dialysis in these patients. The\n      investigators will first determine if increased adrenaline levels during volume removal\n      contributes to IDH. The investigators will then determine lack of suppression of adrenaline\n      levels in the setting of a high BP also contributes to IDH. This will be done by\n      manipulating blood pressure by using small amounts of vasoactive drugs, and determining if\n      an appropriate response in adrenaline levels occurs. Lastly, the investigators will\n      determine if an intradialytic mindfulness meditation program improves BP and adrenaline\n      levels in ESRD patients with IDH."
