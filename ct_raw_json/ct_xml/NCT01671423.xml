  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellulitis is the medical term for an infection of the skin, with symptoms including
      redness, swelling, warmth, and pain. This group of symptoms is called inflammation, and is
      caused by the body's immune system responding to the infection. Standard care for cellulitis
      is using antibiotics to destroy the infection, but the inflammation can persist and cause a
      great deal of pain. The hypothesis of this study is that adding a single dose of an oral
      steroid (prednisone), which tempers the immune response, will reduce inflammation, reduce
      pain, and speed recovery. This hypothesis will be examined by recruiting a group of patients
      with cellulitis, and randomizing them to two sub-groups: one group will receive a dose of
      prednisone, while the other group will receive a placebo. Neither group will know what they
      received unless there is a problem. These subjects will be followed up at the 48 hour mark
      and the 7 day mark, and will have their results compared.
