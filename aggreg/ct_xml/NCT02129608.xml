  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently in the United States about 97 million adults are considered obese, accounting for
      about 33% of the American adult population (compared to 22.9% in 1988).  Obesity, defined as
      a body mass index of 30.0 or higher,  is accountable for 44% of the diabetes, 23% of the
      ischemic heart disease and between 7% and 41% of certain cancers.  The Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0
      Laser (which will be used in this study) has been approved by the FDA (K123237) as a
      non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment which can be used by individuals intending
      to reduce circumference of hips, waist, and thighs.  Lorcaserin is a selective serotonin 2C
      (5-HT(2C)) receptor agonist. The exact mechanism of action is not known, but lorcaserin is
      believed to promote satiety and decrease food intake by activating 5-HT(2C) receptors on
      anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamus.  Lorcaserin was approved by
      the FDA on June 2012 for weight management in people with a BMI of &gt; 27 kg/m2 (overweight)
      when accompanied by a weigh-related condition such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure
      or in people with a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 (obese). The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain
      preliminary data on: 1) effectiveness of the combination of LLLT and lorcaserin for reducing
      abdominal subcutaneous fat in overweight/obese individuals; 2) impact of LLLT on
      inflammatory biomarkers, blood sugar, and cholesterol.

      This study is being done to find out how effective Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT - Erchonia®
      Zerona™ 2.0 Laser)  is compared to Lorcaserin (Belviq®) in helping overweight people reduce
      their weight gain - especially in the central body region.  Subjects will undergo 2
      screening visits in which the investigators will take their medical and weight concern
      histories; and if found eligible, they will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) 12
      weeks of LLLT, 2) 12 weeks of Lorcaserin, and 3) 12 weeks of a combination of both
      Lorcaserin and LLLT.  Full study participation will last approximately 6 months and consists
      of 10 visits- 9 clinical and 1 phone call.  During this study subjects will be provided with
      weight prevention counseling and be asked to complete 3 additional fasting blood draws.
      There will be one urine pregnancy test (for females only) at the beginning of the study.
