      The purpose of this study is to determine whether apremilast is safe and effective for
      treating patients with psoriatic arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast monotherapy in
      subjects with active psoriatic arthritis.

      Approximately 214 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either apremilast 30 mg BID
      (twice a day) or identically-appearing placebo, with approximately 107 subjects per
      treatment group.

      This is a 113-week study.  The subjects will spend 24 weeks in the double-blind,
      placebo-controlled treatment phase, followed by 28 weeks of active treatment phase (ie, up
      to Week 52 visit).  The original treatment assignments (apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day)
      or placebo) will remain blinded until all subjects have completed their Week 52 visit (or
      have discontinued).  After the Week 52 visit, all subjects in the extension phase will
      continue to receive treatment with apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day) until the end of the
      study (ie, up to Week 104 visit) or until early discontinuation from the trial.

      The study will consist of 5 phases:

        1. Screening Phase - up to 5 weeks

        2. Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double Blind Treatment Phase - Weeks 0 to 24

        3. Active Treatment Phase - Week 24 to Week 52

        4. Open-label Extension Phase - Week 52 to Week 104

        5. Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase

                  below while on investigational product and for at least 28 days after
                  administration of the last dose of the investigational product.

        At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a female subject of
        childbearing potential's contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the
        investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and the correct and
        consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent
        pregnancy.

        Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
        Baseline.  All FCBP subjects who engage in activity in which conception is possible must
        use one of the approved contraceptive options described below:

        tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2:  Male or female condom (latex condom
        or non latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane];
        PLUS one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b) cervical cap with
        spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide.

        17. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in
        which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or nonlatex
        condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on
        investigational product and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational
        product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - 1. History of clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) cardiac,
             endocrine, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic, renal, hematologic,
             immunologic disease, or other major uncontrolled disease.

             2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places
             the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

             3. Clinically significant abnormality on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at
             Screening.
