            "textblock": "Background: Esophageal cancer is one of the leading malignancies in Taiwan. Accuracy tumor\n      staging can direct to appropriate therapy planning and provide prognostic implications.\n      Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has been shown\n      to have better N staging and prognostic stratification abilities than conventional imaging\n      modalities, such as endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and CT.\n\n      Purpose: This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET in the initial\n      staging, therapy planning, and therapeutic response monitoring for esophageal cancer\n      patients.\n\n      Method:  Patients with pathological proven esophageal cancer, age 20-90 year-old, will be\n      included in this study. Each patient will receive a baseline PET study. For those patients\n      who received pre-operative CCRT, another PET will be performed 1-4 weeks after completion of\n      CCRT.\n\n      Primary outcome: 1. The incremental staging information by using 18F-FDG PET 2. The impact\n      of the PET results on the patients' subsequent therapy planning 3. To compare treatment\n      response using RECIST criteria and FDG PET results.\n\n      Secondary outcome: To correlate the PET response rate and the patients' disease free\n      survival and overall survival."
