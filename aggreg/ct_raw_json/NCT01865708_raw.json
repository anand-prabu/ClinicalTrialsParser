Children that are anticipated to have an indwelling\n      urinary catheter for >48 hours will be included.  For this pilot study, the investigators\n      will enroll 10 patients. Subject ages will range from 6 months to 17 years. Children who are\n      on a service other than Critical Care Medicine will have clearance from the primary team\n      prior to approaching for enrollment.  The consent process will take place prior to or during\n      the initial 24 hours of urinary catheter placement."
