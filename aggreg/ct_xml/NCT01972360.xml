  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SPECT is currently the dominant clinical test for diagnostic and prognostic purposes as well
      as therapeutic decision-making.  Given the shortage of nuclear reactor-produced Tc,
      advancing the use of non-isotope based imaging modalities has the potential to change the
      standard of care for patients with CAD as each one of these technics (CMR, CT, Stress
      echocardiography) has its own distinct potential advantages over SPECT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obtain a better understanding of the clinical utility of advanced non-isotope-based imaging
      modalities to detect relevant CAD as potential alternatives to SPECT. 450 subjects enrolled
      in total.  Three groups of about 150 patients per group.  Each group will undergo imaging
      with 2 modalities; Group 1: 99mTcSPECT plus CMR, Group 2: 99mTcSPECT plus CT, Group
      3:99mTcSPECT plus stress echocardiography.All 450 patients will undergo standard invasive
      coronary angiography following completion of non-invasive imaging, except for patients in
      whom both nuclear and non-nuclear imaging modalities reveal a normal result confirming the
      absence of significant coronary artery disease (i.e invasive angiography would not be
      clinically indicated and FFR would be considered to be above 0.8). Thrombolysis in
      Myocardial Infraction (TIMI) flow will be measured in all patients undergoing angiography,
      and fractional flow reserve (FFR) will be measured in all patients except those with TIMI
      flow =0, 1 and 2. All imaging procedures must be completed within 6 weeks.  All patients
      will have a follow-up visit at 6 months after enrolment.During the 6 month follow-up visit
      major adverse cardiovascular events will be collected and adjudicated by an clinical
      endpoint committee (CEC).

    <description>During the 6 month follow-up, major adverse cardiovascular events will be collected and adjudicated by a clinical endpoint committee.  Events will be evaluated considered to have been caused by myocardial ischemia leading to modification of medication. Health-related costs, quality of life and exposure to radiation will be assessed. Using these data a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed comparing the 3 non-isotope-based imaging to 99mTc SPECT for the detection of significant coronary artery disease.</description>

        450 patients accross Canada. Patients will be identified after a clinically indicated
        SPECT for evaluation of myocardial ischemia.The investigator will assign the patient in
        one of the three groups based on his medical assessment and availability of equipment at
        the center.
