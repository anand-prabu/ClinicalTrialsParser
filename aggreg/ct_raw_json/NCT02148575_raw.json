The intervention group will receive the MCC, and the\n      attention-control group will receive a symptom management toolkit. Participants' family\n      caregivers will also be enrolled to provide information on patients' self-management.\n      Investigators hypothesize that users of MCC, as compared to attention-control participants,\n      will demonstrate improved knowledge, feelings, and behaviors related to self-management of\n      their cancer care. This innovative research can help to establish palliative care as a\n      mainstay of self-management interventions that target serious illnesses."
