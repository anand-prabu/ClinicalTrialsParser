Drugs such as paclitaxel stop the growth of tumors by blocking\n      cancer cell division. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 inhibits some of the enzymes needed for cell\n      growth and may improve the response of endocrine resistant tumors to treatment. Giving\n      paclitaxel and PI3K inhibitor BKM120 before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce\n      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed."
