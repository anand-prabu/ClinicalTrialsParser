            "textblock": "The integrity of the meniscus is pivotal to the distribution of joint reaction forces and\n      shock absorption across the knee and meniscal damage can lead to secondary degenerative\n      joint disease.  This has lead to treatments directed towards repairing and preserving the\n      meniscus to alter the progression of joint degeneration.  Although success rates of meniscal\n      repair are greater when performed in association with anterior cruciate reconstruction,\n      healing rates remain in the 70-80% range for isolated repairs.\n\n      Therefore, techniques such as the use of fibrin clots, trephining and rasping of the\n      tissues, have been incorporated to improve healing results of meniscal repair.  There has\n      been a surge of enthusiasm for the use of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) to improve healing\n      rates of soft tissue injuries. Therefore, it may be reasonable to surmise that applying\n      blood products, such as thrombin and platelet rich plasma, to the meniscal repair bed may\n      induce more complete and possibly faster healing."
