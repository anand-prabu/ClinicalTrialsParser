The immune\n      system is unable to generate antibodies neutralizing Tat. We develop a synthetic nano\n      vaccine called Tat Oyi able to generate neutralizing antibodies against Tat variants\n      representative of the five main HIV-1 subtypes. Vaccination with Tat Oyi vaccine showed that\n      macaques could resist to a virus inducing immunodeficiency (SHIV) and eliminate virus\n      infected cells."

            "textblock": "Hypotheses: Tat Oyi vaccination on seropositive patients could help their immune system to\n      recognize and neutralize Tat. The neutralization of extra cellular Tat should help the\n      cellular immune response to eliminate  HIV-1 infected cells.\n\n      Methods : The protocol got a favorable judgment from an ethic committee (CPP SudMed 2) on\n      November 9th, 2012 and was authorized by the French drug agency (ANSM) on January 24th,\n      2013. It will be proposed to HIV-1 infected volunteers to participate to a phase I/II\n      clinical trial to test the Tat Oyi vaccine. Volunteers will have an undetectable viremia\n      (lower than 40 copies/ml) and a level of CD4 cells higher than 350 /mm3 since at least one\n      year under Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART). It will be a randomized double blinded clinical\n      trial with placebo. The first step will be a Phase I/IIa carried out on 48 volunteers\n      divided in four groups (n=12). Groups 1, 2 & 3 will have three injections (M0, M1 and M2) of\n      a vaccine having respectively 10, 33 and 100 \u00b5g of the Tat Oyi vaccine. Group 4 will have\n      three injections of a placebo with no active principle. Volunteers will stop their antiviral\n      treatment for two months from M5 to M7. The treatment interruption will make possible to\n      evaluate the optimal vaccine dose to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in a phase IIb.\n      Phase IIb will be carried out on 80 patients who did not participate to the phase I/IIa.\n      They will be divided in two groups (n=40), Group 1 will have the optimal dose of vaccine\n      vaccine and group 2 will have a placebo. We expect that at least 30% of volunteers from\n      group 1 (versus no more 5 % in group 2) can maintain their viremia undetectable (inf 40\n      copies/ml) after interruption of ART.\n\n      Main Objective: No undesirable events due to vaccination and viremia remaining undetectable\n      (inf 40 copies/ml) after interruption of ART for two months.\n\n      Secondary objective: An immune response against Tat characterized by the cross recognition\n      of Tat variants representative of the five main HIV-1 clades.\n\n      Main parameter of evaluation: Plasma viremia. Secondary parameter of evaluation:  Detection\n      with ELISA of antibodies able to recognize Tat variants representative of the five main\n      HIV-1 clades."
