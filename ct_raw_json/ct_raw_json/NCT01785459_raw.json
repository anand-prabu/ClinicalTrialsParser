The subjects will complete a validated pain scale before, and 20 minutes\n      after injection. At twenty minutes post-injection, the subject will be reevaluated for\n      symptoms. The subject will then be eligible for discharge or standard treatment at the\n      discretion of the treating physician.\n\n      Subjects will be followed for 72 hours after enrollment for headache recurrence. Subjects\n      will be monitored for immediate and post-discharge complications."

Treatment of\n      benign headache varies between providers, often including systemic medications with a\n      multitude of possible side effects. Additionally, most headache cocktails require prolonged\n      duration of treatment, occupying valuable bed space in increasingly busy emergency\n      departments.\n\n      In recent years, there has been preliminary investigation into anesthetic injections for the\n      undifferentiated headache patient presenting to the emergency department. It has been\n      proposed that these patients presenting with benign headache might benefit from this novel\n      treatment. Since 2003, paraspinal muscle injections of bupivacaine have been used in\n      emergency department patients with encouraging results. The mechanism of action is not\n      clearly understood; however, it has been proposed that these injections affect the\n      trigeminocervical complex hypothesized to play an integral role in headache physiology,\n      similar to the same mechanism behind greater occipital nerve blocks used by neurologists.\n\n      To the best of the investigators knowledge, there has never been a prospective\n      double-blinded randomized control trial addressing this novel approach to headache\n      management. Even so, the topic of using bupivacaine to inject the paraspinal musculature of\n      the cervical spine has gained wider recognition over the past year. The topic has been\n      discussed heavily on emergency medicine blogs and podcasts. Additionally, online videos have\n      been posted to educate emergency medicine providers on the injection technique. According to\n      retrospective literature, clinical efficacy was observed with a significant proportion of\n      the patients receiving therapeutic effect. These studies, along with anecdotal experience\n      with the procedure at the investigators institution, have led to great excitement concerning\n      the possibility of a new approach to emergency department headache management. However, the\n      topic still needs investigation with a well-designed prospective clinical trial to determine\n      true clinical utility."
