No research was\n      specifically designed to study the corneal taking with these swabs. Nevertheless, numerous\n      reasons would motivate it, because of the peculiarities in ophthalmology: the corneal\n      sampling has to be made with the slit lamp rather than in a macroscopic manner; the corneal\n      lesion are often millimetre-length and confined; the histology of the cornea is unique and\n      compares only imperfectly with other structures of the human body like the nasal mucosa. In\n      these circumstances, the properties of the stalk (rigidity, length) and of its extremity\n      (roughness, textures, absorbance) can influence the quality of the sampling  and the final\n      result of the culture."
