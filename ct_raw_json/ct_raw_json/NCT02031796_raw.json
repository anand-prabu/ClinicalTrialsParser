CAVAREC utilizes the\n      same x-ray projection images as currently acquired for clinical DynaCT.  X-ray image\n      acquisition to allow CAVAREC will occur during the TAVI procedure both before and after the\n      TAVI device is implanted.  The CAVAREC image processing algorithm will be implemented on an\n      off-line workstation after the TAVI procedure is complete.  After the TAVI procedure,\n      CAVAREC images will be quantitatively and qualitatively compared to Siemens DynaCT and\n      cardiac CT images from Radiology.  The results of this study will be used to direct further\n      development of CAVAREC toward the end goal of providing improved imaging capabilities to\n      guide TAVI procedures."
