Combining hormone therapy with chemotherapy and androgen\n      suppression may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more\n      effective for prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus\n      hormone therapy versus androgen suppression alone as initial therapy in patients with\n      prostate cancer that is metastatic or that cannot be removed surgically."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients are treated with medical or surgical castration followed by an\n           anti-androgen therapy with either flutamide, bicalutamide, or nilutamide.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive chemo/hormonal therapy for 3 eight week courses, followed by\n           total androgen blockade. Each course consists of 6 weeks of cytotoxic therapy with\n           doxorubicin, ketoconazole, vinblastine, and estramustine followed by 2 weeks of rest.\n           These patients are also maintained on hydrocortisone both during treatment and during\n           rest.\n\n      Patients in arm II have a long-term central venous access device inserted.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 368 patients will be accrued for this study."
