      The purpose of this study was to investigate various potential factors that affected the
      outcome of treatment of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction is a common condition during the first few years of
      childhood. Most cases may resolve spontaneously, but the remaining children whose blockage
      does not resolve may require primary probing. Controversy remains regarding the optimal
      timing of the probing procedure. Another controversy is related to the setting of surgery.
      Therefore, we try to investigate the factors that affected the outcome of treatment of
      congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction under the same surgical doctor during the past 13
      years in our hospital.

    <description>Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a quite common condition among the infants. An imperforate membrane at the distal end of the nasolacrimal duct is the main cause of occlusion. Children with the signs of NLDO presenting with epiphora and/or mucous discharge were included in this study. Intervention with probing under topical anesthesia was performed on the same surgeon. And success rate was evaluated.</description>

    <description>A punctal dilator was used for dilating the punctum. The nasolacrimal system was irrigated through either the lower or upper punctum with a hollow 23-gauge irrigating cannula attached to a syringe. A #0 (or #00) Bowman probe was passed through either the lower or upper canaliculus into the lacrimal sac and then directed downward through the nasolacrimal duct into nasal cavity. A &quot;Hard&quot; resistance could be felt as the probe touched the end of the nasolacrimal duct. A &quot;Pop&quot; tactile sensation might be noted while the probe passing through an obstruction at the valve of Hasner.</description>
