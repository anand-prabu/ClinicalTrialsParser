UCN-01 may increase the effectiveness of a chemotherapy drug by\n      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus UCN-01 in treating\n      patients who have advanced or refractory solid tumors."

Patients receive an\n      initial dose of UCN-01 IV over 72 hours beginning on day 2 during course 1 and then\n      maintenance UCN-01 IV over 36 hours beginning on day 2 during subsequent courses. Treatment\n      repeats every 4 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fluorouracil until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-48 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 14 months."
