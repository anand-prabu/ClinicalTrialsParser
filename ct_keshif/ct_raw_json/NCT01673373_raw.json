            "textblock": "This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial that will take place at up to\n      25 US/ Outside US (OUS) sites. Primary endpoints have been determined to show the safety,\n      effectiveness, and clinical outcomes of the iCAST\u2122 RX Stent System. Safety and effectiveness\n      will be evaluated based on the primary patency rate at 9-months on a per lesion basis\n      evaluated against a performance goal of published studies with bare-metal stents. The\n      primary clinical endpoint will assess the improvement in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) at\n      9-months as compared to baseline Systolic Blood Pressure.\n\n      Eligible subjects will undergo a two-week Medical Documentation Screening period to confirm\n      resistant hypertension (SBP \u2265 155mmHg) while on maximum tolerable doses of \u2265 three\n      anti-hypertensive medications from at least three distinct classes of drugs, one of which\n      must be a diuretic.\n\n      There must be documented clinical evidence to support likelihood of angiographic findings >\n      80% whether it is Duplex Ultrasound (DUS), Computed Tomography angiogram (CTa), Magnetic\n      Resonance angiogram (MRa) or other medical evidence. After meeting screening and clinical\n      eligibility criteria, subjects will undergo a baseline assessment for angiographic\n      eligibility. After angiographic documentation of a \u2265 80% renal artery stenosis or Fraction\n      Flow Reserve (FFR) < 0.8 is confirmed, the subject may be enrolled in the trial by placement\n      of the investigational device.\n\n      The 9-month visit will include a follow-up DUS of the target renal artery. If the DUS is\n      non-diagnostic due to an imaging problem, such as overlying bowel gas or body habitus, a\n      second DUS may be attempted. If the DUS is indicative of \u2265 60% stenosis as determined by the\n      core laboratory, or the second DUS remains non-diagnostic, a contrast angiogram will be used\n      to assess the degree of restenosis of the covered stent(s).\n\n      Clinical follow-up visits will be required for all enrolled subjects at 30-days, 9-months,\n      12-months, 24-months, and 36-months.  A 6-month and 18-month visit will occur via telephone\n      to collect medication usage and Adverse Events (AEs) only.  The 36-month clinic office visit\n      will be required as the final safety visit."

Subject or subject's legal representative have been informed of the nature of the\n             trial, agrees to participate, and has signed an Institutional Review Board\n             (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved Informed Consent Form (ICF).\n\n          3. Subjects that have bilateral kidneys or a solitary functioning kidney with Renal\n             Artery Stenosis in at least one kidney and an average Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) \u2265\n             155mmHg.\n\n          4. Subject has a history of maximum tolerable dose of \u2265 3 anti-hypertensive medications\n             of different classes, one of which must be a diuretic (for at least two weeks prior\n             to Medical Documentation Screening period).\n\n             a. A documented history for a minimum of 3 months showing reasonable and aggressive\n             efforts to manage hypertension prior to consent. This must include the use of a broad\n             variety of medications that have been used and failed or not tolerated.\n\n          5. Subject must have documented clinical evidence to support likelihood of angiographic\n             findings > 80% whether it is DUS, CTa, MRa or other medical evidence.\n\n          6. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, II, or III the time of trial enrollment.\n\n        NOTE: When a subject has bilateral Renal Artery Stenosis both of which require stenting,\n        it is recommended to treat both kidneys with an iCAST\u2122 RX Stent System during the index\n        procedure. In the event that a subject needs a renal stenting procedure staged for renal\n        protection, it is important that the Investigator treats the second renal artery with an\n        iCAST\u2122 RX Stent System after 30 days of the index procedure. If subjects with bilateral\n        stenosis have only one lesion that meets protocol inclusion criteria that lesion should be\n        treated per protocol. The recommendation is to NOT treat the second non-qualifying lesion,\n        however if the operator feels strongly it is indicated, then they should treat per\n        standard of care after 30-days post index procedure in order to comply with exclusion\n        criteria #10.\n\n        Subjects with flash pulmonary edema are allowed into the trial should they meet all other\n        Inclusion and Exclusion criteria.\n\n        Angiographic Anatomic Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.

Subjects with 60-79% angiographic stenosis who have confirmed FFR < 0.8 may be\n             enrolled.\n\n          2. Renal pole-to-pole length > 8cm (per visual estimate).\n\n          3.
