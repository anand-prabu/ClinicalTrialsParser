Carbon dioxide infusion restores the blood flow\n      in chronic wounds of the lower limbs."

Carbon dioxide infusion was performed with\n      the needle pointed toward the granulation tissue, 5cm distant from each one at intervals of\n      4 days. Biopsies were collected from the wounds before carbon dioxide infusion and after the\n      3rd, 5th and 10th application. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using\n      Wilcoxon's test and Friedman's variance analysis and multiple comparisons test."
