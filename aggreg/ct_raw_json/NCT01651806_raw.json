The patient\n      and the independent reviewer will be blinded as to the dose of TA utilized during the\n      surgery. This information will be linked to a confidential database for later review by the\n      principal investigator.\n\n      Treatment allocation:\n\n      All eligible patients (i.e., meeting inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria) will be\n      treated and observed per the research protocol. All patients will maintain the right to\n      refuse participation and receive a specific treatment of the study if desired.\n\n      Trial Population\n\n      Target population:\n\n      The target sample size is 60 patients of each of the uniform and weighted dose groups (120\n      total) with each group split evenly between males and females. There will be one actively\n      enrolling surgeon (Dr. Brett Levine). The goal is to enroll a total of 120 subjects\n      experiencing joint pain that warrants a TKA. The specific diagnosis for the joint pain will\n      not direct the subjects' assignment or eligibility at the time of surgery. All 120 patients\n      will be enrolled from the office of the primary investigator (Dr. Brett Levine). All\n      indications for TKA will be included unless one of the exclusion criteria is met."
