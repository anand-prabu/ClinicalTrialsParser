If it a blood pregnancy test\n      is performed, a portion of blood will be used from routine blood draws that are collected as\n      part of your standard of care surgery.\n\n      During your standard of care surgery, the radiologist will take images and videos with an\n      ultrasound machine before you are given the contrast agent. This is done to learn if cancer\n      has spread around the kidney.\n\n      You will then receive the DEFINITY by vein over about 1 minute. After you receive the\n      injection of DEFINITY, the radiologist will take more images and videos of the tumor and\n      kidney(s) to compare to those recorded earlier.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Your active participation in this study will be over after you have completed the follow-up\n      visit.\n\n      Follow-Up Phone Call:\n\n      You will have a follow-up phone call 30 days after your standard of care surgery is complete\n      to review any side effects you may be having. This call should take about 10 minutes to\n      complete.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  DEFINITY is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      use in contrast enhanced echocardiography.  It is not FDA approved or commercially available\n      for use in radiology.\n\n      Up to 11 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
