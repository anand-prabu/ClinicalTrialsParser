  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (individuals will be assigned in a random order to study treatment
      sequences), open-label (identity of assigned treatment sequences will be known), single
      dose, 2-cycle, crossover (patients will receive both treatments in a random order)
      bioequivalence study of DOXIL/CAELYX (doxorubicin HCL) in patients with advanced or
      refractory solid malignancies (including patients with ovarian cancer). This study has an
      adaptive 2-stage design. Bioequivalence based on encapsulated doxorubicin will be tested at
      the end of Stage 1 using data from at least 24 ovarian cancer patients. An interim analysis
      of free doxorubicin will be performed at the end of Stage 1 using data from 42 patients of
      all cancer types. The study may continue into Stage 2 with additional patients of all cancer
      types; and final evaluation of bioequivalence for free doxorubicin will be performed at the
      end of Stage 2. The study will include a screening phase followed by an open-label treatment
      phase consisting of 2 doxorubicin treatment cycles and an end-of-treatment visit on Cycle 3,
      Day 1. Participants may enter an optional extension phase after 2 cycles. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be obtained
      from all participants at specified times over 29 days after starting each study drug
      administration in Cycles 1 and 2 for determination of plasma concentrations of encapsulated
      and free doxorubicin.

             verapamil) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital,
             phenytoin, rifampin and St John's wort) from at least 4 weeks before the first dose
             of doxorubicin in Cycle 1 and until after completion of all pharmacokinetic sampling
             in Cycle 2

          -  Has any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make participation
             not be in the best interest (eg, compromise the well-being) of the patient or that
             could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments

          -  Woman who is pregnant, or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant or is a man
