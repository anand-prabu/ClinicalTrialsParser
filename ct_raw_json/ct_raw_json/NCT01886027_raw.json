In this randomized, controlled trial, the investigators will\n      compare EAET to a standard intervention that teaches the conceptually opposite\n      approach\u2014relaxation training (RT)\u2014and test how both of these interventions compare to a\n      wait-list control condition. The investigators hypothesize that individuals in the EAET\n      group will demonstrate greater improvement in their IBS symptom severity, psychological\n      functioning, quality of life, and health care utilization at 4 and 12-week follow-up time\n      points, compared to individuals in the wait-list control group. It is also expected that\n      both of the active interventions (EAET and RT) will be more efficacious than the wait-list\n      control condition."
