The shorter life expectancy is caused by natural and unnatural\n      death. In general, patients with a mental disorder tend to have a more unhealthy lifestyle,\n      than the general population, characterized by e.g. lack of exercise and smoking.\n\n      Hypothesis\n\n      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is underdiagnosed in psychiatric inpatients\n      There is a higher prevalence of COPD in psychiatric inpatients compared to the general\n      population Screening of patients with one respiratory symptom and a smoking history, has the\n      same sensitivity regarding to diagnosis of COPD, as screening all patients with a smoking\n      history\n\n      Method:\n\n      80 psychiatric inpatients will undergo spirometry with reversibility test and COPD\n      Assessment Test (CATest). Furthermore, patient history regarding respiratory symptoms and\n      smoking will be taken into account."
