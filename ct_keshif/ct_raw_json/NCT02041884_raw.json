            "textblock": "Approximately one-third of children with ADHD continue to be fully symptomatic into\n      adulthood and many of the remainders often retain some residual problems that require\n      treatment. Thus ADHD is a prevalent and chronic disabling disorder. Drugs provide first line\n      treatment for adults with ADHD but are not enough for everybody, while we still lack proper\n      evidence for promising psychological treatment. In addition to core symptoms of ADHD\n      including regulatory difficulties of attention, activity level and impulses, difficulties\n      with emotional regulation are common.\n\n      Follow-up studies of adults with ADHD have shown that only a few patients were offered\n      sufficient treatment and support after the neuropsychiatric assessment and testing. The\n      majority of adults diagnosed with ADHD are offered pharmacological treatment (stimulant\n      medication) as the sole treatment. However, stimulant medication is not effective for up to\n      20-50 percent of adults as they may not experience symptom reduction or they are unable to\n      tolerate the medication.\n\n      Consequently, the possible benefits of identifying and treating individuals with ADHD are\n      extensive. Treatment of ADHD is preferably multimodal, i.e. consisting of more than one\n      intervention.\n\n      Although literature regarding psychological treatment is relatively limited, studies of\n      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) show that\n      structured short-term therapies are promising in reducing ADHD related symptoms and\n      increasing life quality.  The main treatment focus is to enhance executive and\n      organizational skills, improvement of consequence thinking and impulse control as well as\n      emotion regulation skills.  However, the range of trained psychologist in this field is\n      rather limited.  Using internet for delivering evidence-based psychological treatment can\n      therefore be a innovative treatment alternative in order to make inaccessible treatment\n      available to a large group of patients with ADHD.\n\n      The actual treatment project aims to evaluate if adults with ADHD can benefit from\n      psychological treatment delivered through Internet. About 150-200 patients will be recruited\n      through several outpatient clinics in Stockholm. They will be randomized to one of three\n      conditions - active psychological treatment (based on CBT and DBT), an active alternative\n      treatment  where they undergo a psychoeducational support program (based on CBT) or to\n      treatment as usual (TAU) / waiting list. The patients in the treatment conditions will have\n      a personal contact via the internet with a psychologist within the 12 week treatment period.\n      Assessments will be done before, during and after treatment, and after 3 and 12 months. The\n      patients in the TAU condition will be offered iCBT treatment after they have filled out the\n      post assessments (after 12 weeks and at 3rd month after treatment)."
