A report of the patients' visit and tests, along with suggestions or\n        recommendations will be sent to each referring physician.  There is a wide spectrum of\n        neuromuscular diseases to be studied, among them are: peripheral neuropathies, myopathies,\n        dystrophies, myasthenia, stiff person syndrome, muscle cramps, myotonias, motor neuron\n        diseases, post-polio syndrome, and certain demyelinating disorders affecting both the\n        central and the peripheral nervous system."
