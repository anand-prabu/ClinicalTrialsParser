      This observational study will evaluate the use and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) in monotherapy in routine clinical practice in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis. Eligible patients initiated on RoActemra/Actemra treatment according to the
      approved label will be followed for 6 months.
