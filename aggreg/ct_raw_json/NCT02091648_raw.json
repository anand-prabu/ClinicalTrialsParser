The investigators aim (1) to establish feasibility of this approach by recruiting\n      from different schools and (2) to learn whether individuals assigned to receive the\n      intervention show improvements in psychological function, decreases in lung inflammation,\n      and related improvements in asthma health when compared with disease severity-matched peers\n      who receive education-only or standard care."
