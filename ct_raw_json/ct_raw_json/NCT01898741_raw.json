In this study, we want to evaluate safety and\n      technical feasibility for cone beam CT guided stereotactic radiotherapy for locally advanced\n      pancreatic carcinoma."

Radiotherapy will be delivered in three fractions of 8 Gy on\n      an outpatient basis.\n\n      Primary study outcome:\n\n      The main study endpoint will be safety of the procedure, expressed in proportion of patients\n      experiencing treatment-induced toxicity grade 3 or more according to the CTC-AE 4.0 due to\n      the complete procedure within 90 days of the last radiation.\n\n      Secondary study outcome:\n\n      Other study parameters will be technical feasibility, treatment response, quality of life,\n      overall survival, progression free survival, and rate of possible secondary resections\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group\n      relatedness:\n\n      Increased severe toxicity may occur due to the intervention, but treatment related toxicity\n      should be limited due to strict dose constraints to the organs at risk (e.g. duodenum,\n      stomach). Potential benefits may be pain relief, due to local control of the tumor, and a\n      prolonged survival."
