In the study, the spermatic cord of particpants will be\n      injected with either Botox or a placebo of saline.  Botox is currently used to treat other\n      urological conditions like overactive bladder and lower urinary tract problems.  For these\n      conditions, Botox works by relaxing muscles in the affected areas.  The investigators\n      believe that Botox will act similarly in the treatment chronic testicular pain."
