  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators assume that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy can reduce the
      mortality, stroke rate and secondary coronary surgery in CAD with obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass
      grafting (CABA) during postoperative follow-up of 3 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators observe whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy can reduce
      the mortality, stroke rate and secondary coronary surgery in CAD with OSA patients after
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABA) during
      postoperative follow-up of 3 years. During the 3 years, we randomize all enrolled patients
      to 2 groups separately beginning CPAP or Sham-CPAP intervention after sleep monitoring.
      Guidance for all patients during follow-up 1 week, 2 week, 1 month, 3 month. The follow-up
      procedure includes clinical assessments at three months, one year, two and three years
      respectively.The primary outcome variables are prospectively being documented and are not
      subject to observer bias.Baseline comorbidity data, results of the sleep recordings,
      compliance with CPAP device, scores of the questionnaires as well as results of the blood
      analysis are performed and/or documented consecutively in separate files by research
      personnel blinded to the allocation of the study groups and/or unaware of the results of the
      concomitant outcomes.
