            "textblock": "Irreversible damage to immature permanent teeth as a result of noxious infection or local\n      trauma before normal physiological closure of the apical structure represents a real\n      clinical challenge. The conventional therapeutic approach is to consider the use of\n      synthetic biocompatible materials, such as calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] and mineral trioxide\n      aggregate (MTA), to induce apical closure, or apexification, by forming a hard tissue\n      barrier across the root apex. However, neither MTA nor calcium hydroxide are currently able\n      either to induce or stimulate pulp regeneration, or to ensure that conventional root\n      development continues once damage has taken place, so that the inherent risk of root\n      fracture remains. Along with the development of new regenerative protocols to resolve\n      clinical deficiencies, continuing advances in the discovery and characterization of stem\n      cells of dental origin\u2014able to differentiate into multiple tissue types\u2014have recently\n      broadened possible therapeutic horizons towards pulp tissue regeneration and apexogenesis.\n      Some studies have suggested that the recent discovery and characterization of stem cells\n      from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) form the cell source of apexogenesis in\n      immature teeth with periradicular periodontitis of endodontic origin. The purpose of this\n      clinical trial is to both clarify the efficiency of autologous SHED to regenerate pulp and\n      apical tissue in the patients with immature permanent teeth and pulp necrosis to confirm the\n      safety of using autologous stem cells in clinical endodontic regenerative medicine. This is\n      a single-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled study. This study has been approved by the\n      ethical committees of School of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University. The study\n      will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki."
