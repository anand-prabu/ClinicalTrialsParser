Once these treatments have failed, different alternative procedures can be\n      applied to relief pain. Thermal treatment of the intervertebral disc (Percutaneous Cervical\n      Nucleoplasty; PCN) is the most often applied technique on the neck with a low risk of\n      thermal damage. A variety of published studies have demonstrated this treatment to be both\n      safe and effective. However, treatment of the nerve root (Pulsed Radio Frequency; PRF) is\n      also a popular type of pain treatment. The application of PRF is also a safe and useful\n      intervention for neck pain. Although these treatment types are described in the literature,\n      the available evidence for efficacy is not sufficient to allow definitive conclusions on the\n      optimal therapy to be made. The purpose of this study is to investigate which technique is\n      the most effective in terms of pain relief on short term in patients with contained cervical\n      disc herniation: PCN or PRF?"

If in the correct position, the stylet is withdrawn and the Perc DC SpineWand (ArthroCare Co., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is introduced. The procedure relies on so-called Coblation technology which involves removing a portion of the nucleus tissue by using radio frequency energy. More specific, it results in ablation of a portion of nucleus tissue, not with heat, but with a low-temperature (typically 40-70\u00b0 C) plasma field of ionized particles.",

The position is checked radiographically and by motor and sensory nerve stimulation. When the needle has been placed correctly an electrode is introduced, which conducts short bursts of radio frequency energy to nervous tissue. It is known as a non- or minimally neurodestructive technique, alternative to radio frequency heat lesions using so-called thermocoagulation. No nerve damage takes places as the temperature of the tip of the needle does not exceed 42\u00b0C. This is achieved by relatively long pauses between pulses which allow generated heat to dissipate and prevent the development of any thermal lesion.",
