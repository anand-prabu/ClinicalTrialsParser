Many patients seen in the ED\n      report they were unaware of past or future outpatient appointments for which they had been\n      scheduled. These patients are clearly in need of primary care, yet fail to attend 30% of all\n      scheduled outpatient appointments. Patients most often report that they failed to attend\n      scheduled appointments as a result of forgetfulness or confusion regarding dates, times, or\n      locations. National data confirmed by our previous work in the LAC+USC ED demonstrates that\n      > 80% of this population reports using a text-capable mobile device. The investigators\n      believe a system of text message appointment reminders has tremendous potential to\n      facilitate clinic attendance among these patients in desperate need of primary care."
