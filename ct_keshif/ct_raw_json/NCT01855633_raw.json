The effects of rehabilitation therapy\n      are limited. The development of new treatment strategies is essential. Repetitive\n      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive method to stimulate the focal\n      area of the brain for restoring brain function.  The aim of this study is to investigate the\n      therapeutic effect of rTMS on the motor recovery in patients with hemiplegic stroke."
