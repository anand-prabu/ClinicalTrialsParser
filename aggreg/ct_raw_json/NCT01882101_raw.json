The efficacy of biofeedback therapy for incontinence has not\n      been proven on the randomized controlled trials. Sacral nerve stimulation is too expensive\n      although some prospective studies showed the therapeutic potential. Recently, posterior\n      tibial nerve stimulation has been reported to be effective with lower cost in comparison\n      with sacral nerve stimulation. This study is designed to show the efficacy of posterior\n      tibial nerve stimulation compared with biofeedback therapy for fecal incontinence."
