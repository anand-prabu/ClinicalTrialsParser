Within 4 weeks of hematologic recovery, patients\n      achieving remission after induction receive consolidation chemotherapy with cytarabine IV\n      over 1 hour every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Subsequent courses of consolidation\n      chemotherapy begin within 2 weeks of documentation of hematologic recovery from the prior\n      consolidation course. Consolidation chemotherapy continues for 4 courses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional\n      patients are accrued to receive induction chemotherapy at the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years,\n      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients (phase I) and then an additional 24-27 patients\n      (phase II) will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
