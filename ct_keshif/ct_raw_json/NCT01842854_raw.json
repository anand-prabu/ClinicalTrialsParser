            "textblock": "Previous studies indicate that activated macrophages secrete Galectin-3, a molecule that is\n      involved in the development of fibrosis and tissue rearrangement  in the liver, kidney and\n      the heart. Its plasmatic levels are increased on patients with acute decompensated heart\n      failure. These observations suggest that measuring levels of Galectin-3 in patients with\n      cardiac diseases can be useful to determine their prognosis. To investigate the role of this\n      new biomarker in Chagas Disease, we will study a Chagas Disease  population (including\n      patients with the indeterminate and cardiac form of the disease). The assessment of the\n      prognostic value of Galectin-3 will be done through the comparison between its plasmatic\n      levels and each patients's clinical evaluation, disease severity, inflammatory biomarkers\n      and cardiac function tests.\n\n      The patients included in the study must at first sign the written consent. They shall be\n      accompanied in the specialized outpatient clinics for Chagas disease - Hospital S\u00e3o Rafael -\n      Centro de Biotecnologia e Terapia Celular. They will be submitted to several tests,\n      including:\n\n        -  Collection of Blood samples for biochemical analysis;\n\n        -  Electrocardiogram;\n\n        -  Holter Electrocardiogram;\n\n        -  Echocardiogram;\n\n        -  Treadmill Test;\n\n        -  X-Ray Imaging;\n\n        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging;\n\n        -  Evaluation of the quality of life through the application of questionnaires (SF 36 and\n           the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire)."
