Stem cells are\n      \"seed cells\" necessary to make blood cells. Researchers want to see if using less radiation\n      and less chemotherapy with new immune suppressing drugs will enable a stem cell transplant\n      to work. Researchers are hoping to see a mixture of recipient and donor stem cells after\n      transplant. This mixture of donor and recipient stem cells is called \"mixed-chimerism\".\n      Researchers hope to see these donor cells eliminate tumor cells. This is called a\n      \"graft-versus-leukemia\" response."
