        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients from age 5 - 16 years with a clinical picture
             (see below) consistent with Ullrich CMD or MDC1A (LAMA2/merosin deficient CMD)

          -  Under regular review at a neuromuscular centre

          -  On adequate double-barrier contraception (if of child-bearing potential)

          -  Stable on any allowed concomitant medications for 1 month prior to run in phase

          -  FVC &lt; 80% of the predicted value at Screening and Baseline visit(s)

        For patients with Ullrich CMD - required clinical picture:

        • Muscle weakness: inability to walk or, if patient is still ambulatory, inability to run
        and &gt; 5 s for 10 m walk

        Genetics and Pathology:

          -  Molecular diagnosis of collagen VI related myopathy, defined by one dominant or two
             recessive COL6A1, COL6A2 or COL6A3 mutation(s) known to cause the clinical picture,
             OR

          -  Histological diagnosis showing (i) absent or significantly decreased  expression of
             collagen VI in muscle (overall reduction or basal lamina specific) or (ii) absent or
             significantly abnormal matrix in skin fibroblast culture

        For patients with LAMA2 deficient CMD (MDC1A) - required clinical picture:

        • Muscle weakness: Inability to walk; if patient is still ambulatory, inability to run and
        &gt; 5 s for 10 m walk.

        Genetics and Pathology:

          -  Either: 2 identified pathologic or probable pathologic mutations in LAMA2 gene OR

          -  1 identified pathologic or probable pathologic mutation in LAMA 2 gene with evidence
             of decrease in laminin alpha 2 staining on muscle or skin biopsy OR

          -  Evidence of decrease in laminin alpha 2 staining on muscle or skin biopsy with
             matching clinical phenotype and no suspicion of aDG-RD

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational drug other than the study medication within 3 months of
             study start.

          -  Recurrent hospitalisation for chest infections in previous 2 years (≥2 per year)

          -  Patients with respiratory parameters currently affected by concomitant medications or
             conditions (conduct baseline assessments when the patient has recovered and no longer
             taking acute medication)

          -  Any need for surgery (scoliosis, gastrostomy, other) in the preceding 6 months or
             foreseen during the course of the study.

          -  Any intercurrent significant medical condition which in the opinion of the
             Investigator or the study Medical Monitor is suspected of potentially affecting the
             patient's safety or compliance with the study procedures

          -  Failure to thrive, defined as:

               -  Falling 20 percentiles (20/100) in body weight in the 3 months preceding
                  Screening/Baseline

               -  In patients below the 3rd percentile, any further drop in body weight percentile
                  in the 3 months preceding Screening/Baseline

          -  Weight less than 17kg at Baseline

          -  Morbidly obese or grossly overweight (≥86 percentile BMI in children)

          -  History of epilepsy or on antiepileptic medication at Screening/Baseline

          -  Diabetes

          -  FVC% predicted &lt;30%

          -  On Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) Expectation of non-compliance with study procedures
             (i.e. study medication intake and/or PK blood sampling) excluding exploratory
             efficacy assessments

          -  Intake of prohibited medication (as listed in Appendix A of the protocol)

          -  Patients with renal impairment defined as urinary protein concentration ≥ 0.2 g/L

          -  Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment
