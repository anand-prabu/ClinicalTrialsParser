  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional diagnostic, international, multicenter and non-comparative
      study of EGFR mutation status in aNSCLC patients (locally advanced and/or metastatic
      disease) with adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma histologies. This study will be
      conducted in Japan and Europe and will assess the concordance of EGFR mutation status
      derived from tumour samples and blood based circulating free DNA.  The data generated will
      inform the use of less-invasive sample types in diagnostic practice. The study also aims to
      assess the current status of EGFR mutation testing across Japan and Europe and gaps in
      currently available data including EGFR mutation frequency in particular populations and
      demographic subgroups, EGFR mutation frequency in histological subtypes of NSCLC, EGFR
      mutation test process and methodology, utility of multiple sample types in the assessment of
      EGFR mutation status, and impact of EGFR mutation status on therapy choice. The data may be
      used to drive improvements to the EGFR mutation testing process, ensuring that patients have
      access to testing and are treated appropriately on the basis of the molecular features of
      their disease.
