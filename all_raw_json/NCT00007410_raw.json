            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Abnormalities in the plasminogen activator system have been implicated in the pathogenesis\n      of arterial and cerebral thrombosis. In particular, elevated plasma levels of plasminogen\n      activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and t-PA/PAI-1\n      complexes have been found to correlate with increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI)\n      and/or stroke. Vascular fibrinolytic balance is, to a large part, determined by the\n      competing effects of t-PA and PAI-1, and reflects a complex interplay between genetic and\n      environmental factors. The present collaboration focuses on the common hypothesis that the\n      association between activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and\n      atherothrombotic events derives from an interaction between the RAAS and the fibrinolytic\n      system.\n\n      The study is part of an initiative \"Thrombosis of the Arterial and Cerebral Vasculature: New\n      Molecular Genetic Concepts for Prevention and Treatment\" which was released in April 1999.\n      The objective of the initiative is to establish collaborative teams of closely interacting\n      investigators with diverse, complementary areas of expertise to elucidate the molecular\n      genetic mechanisms of thrombosis in the arterial and cerebral vasculature.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The investigators will use two population-based samples of unrelated individuals to address\n      their aims: 1) study subjects in the PREVEND study in Groningen, The Netherlands in whom DNA\n      and plasma samples and clinical data have already been collected and 2) an estimated 2000\n      unrelated study subjects from Ghana, Africa in whom data need to be collected. The\n      collaborative study focuses on the common hypothesis that the association between activation\n      of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and atherothrombotic events derives from\n      an interaction between the RAAS and the fibrinolytic system."
