  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remembering how to travel from one location to another is critical in everyday life, yet
      this vital ability declines with normal aging and can be further affected by conditions that
      disproportionately affect the elderly, such as vision loss or progressive dementia. Human
      and animal research has shown that two distinct memory systems interact during navigation.
      The first, referred to as allocentric navigation, is very flexible and uses spatial
      knowledge of key features or landmarks to develop and use a mental map of the environment.
      This approach involves brain regions that are critical for new learning and memory but that
      decline with age. The second, referred to as egocentric navigation, is inflexible and relies
      on &quot;habit&quot; memories that link specific features with specific directions. This approach
      relies on brain regions that are critical for &quot;automatic&quot; responses and that are relatively
      unaffected by age.

      The main problem is that allocentric navigation declines with age and is accompanied
      increased dependence on egocentric navigation. This change increases the risk of becoming
      disoriented or &quot;lost&quot; when traveling in unfamiliar areas or even when traveling new routes
      in familiar areas. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to examine whether
      non-invasive brain stimulation, specifically transcranial direct current stimulation, can
      improve allocentric navigation in healthy older adults.

      Participants will complete three functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions while
      learning new environments. Before two of these sessions, older adults will receive brain
      stimulation that is designed to improve or reduce allocentric navigation, which should
      improve functioning in the related brain regions. The expectation is that egocentric
      navigation will demonstrate the opposite response to stimulation. The older adults will also
      be compared against a group of healthy young participants to examine whether stimulation
      reduced age-related impairments in allocentric memory and associated brain functioning.

      Ultimately, this approach could be used in combination with cognitive rehabilitation
      techniques or external memory aids, like physical maps, and benefit a wide range of older
      adults both with and without additional age-related diseases that affect cognitive
      functioning.
