  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate a new imaging modality, 3-dimmensional sonographic
      volumetric analysis, and compare it to the conventional 2-dimmensional analysis that is
      currently in place.  Those patients who are scheduled to have an ultrasound as part of their
      infertility treatment will be offered the opportunity to have additional measurements done
      at the time of their ultrasound; these additional measurements will take less than 2 minutes
      and do no require any additional sonograms, tests, or interventions.  All patients are
      eligible (oocyte donors and autologous oocyte patients) and only patients with a serum
      estradiol &gt; 2000pg/ML will be enrolled in the study.  After the additional measurements are
      obtained, the results will be digitally stored.  The results of the 3D sonographic
      volumetric analysis will then be correlated with the patients' IVF performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of the study is that 3-dimensional sonographic volumetric analysis may be a
      superior imaging modality for sonographically assessing oocyte maturity and may lead to
      change in clinical practice.  The lone risk of the study is rooted in protecting the
      patients' protected health information.
