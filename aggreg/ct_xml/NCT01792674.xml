  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Care for pregnant is a field where unexpected emergencies occur, however emergencies are
      rare and hence competences difficult to learn. Therefore, it can be relevant to use
      simulation-based medical education. Many questions on how simulation can optimise learning
      remain unanswered.  A major question is how simulation settings as 'in situ simulation'
      (i.e. in the actual patient care unit) versus 'off site simulation' (i.e. in training rooms
      or simulation center) impact learning.

      Objectives: To study the effect of  'in situ simulation' versus 'off site simulation' on
      learning outcome, safety-attitudes, team performance and clinical performance in the
      simulated setting plus stress and motivational  inducing effect of simulation settings.

      Design: Randomised trial. Primary outcome: Written knowledge-test. Exploratory outcomes:
      Safety Attitudes Questionnaire, team- and clinical performance score, validated stress
      inventory, salivary cortisol, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and questionnaire on
      perceptions of the simulation and organisational changes needed.

      Perspective: To provide new knowledge on contextual effects of different simulation
      settings.

      Background: Care for pregnant and delivering women is a field where unexpected emergencies,
      as for example emergency caesarean sectio, postpartum bleeding or severe preeclampsia, that
      may potentially harm both mother and baby, occur. Obstetric emergencies are rare and hence
      by nature difficult to learn in real life. Therefore, it can be relevant with
      simulation-based medical education, i.e., training with mannequins and scenarios. In
      non-systematic reviews it is concluded that repetitive medical simulations are associated
      with improved learner outcomes. However, many questions on how simulation can optimise
      learning in emergencies remain unanswered; e.g., how different kinds of simulation settings
      as 'in situ simulation' versus 'off site simulation' impact learning at the individual and
      the team level.

      Objectives: In a randomised trial on authentic obstetric-anaesthesia teams to study the
      effect of 'in situ simulation' versus 'off site simulation' on participants learning
      outcome, safety-attitudes, team performance plus motivational and stress inducing effect of
      different simulation settings and the potential association with learning and performance.

      Interventions: The experimental intervention is training in 'in situ simulation' which means
      training in the actual patient care unit, in this situation the labour suite and operation
      theatre. The control group will receive the same training 'off site simulation', i.e., in
      training rooms away from the actual patient care unit. In the two different simulation
      settings, the same scenarios will be conducted and the participants will comprise of
      authentic teams of specialised obstetricians or obstetric trainees in their final training
      year, trainee obstetricians, midwifes, auxiliary nurses, specialised anaesthetists or
      anaesthesia trainees in their final training year, trainee anaesthetists, anaesthesia
      nurses, and surgical nurses.

      Design and trial size: Single-centre investigator-initiated randomised superiority trial. We
      have chosen to calculate the required sample size based on experiences about knowledge
      tests. We assume a standard deviation at 24%, and a difference in the experimental and
      control means at 17%. With alpha set at 0.05, beta set at 0.80 and intraclass correlation at
      0,05 the sample size added up to 93 participants. It is planned to include 100 participants.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome: 1) Knowledge by written test as multiple choice questions.

      Exploratory outcomes: 1) Safety Attitudes Questionnaire SAQ). 2) Team performance score
      measured by Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM). 3) Clinical performance in the
      simulated setting. 4) Salivary cortisol. 5) Validated stress inventory (Stress-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI-1) and cognitive appraisal). 6) Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). 7)
      Questionnaire to evaluate participants' perceptions of the simulation, the debriefing, and
      changes needed at the organisational level.

      Time schedule: 2 years with start planning 1st of April 2012. Randomisation will start after
      approval from the Regional Ethics Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The
      intervention with 'in situ simulation' versus 'on site simulation' described in this
      protocol will be scheduled spring 2013.
