The purpose of this study is to determine the difference between\n      temperatures measured by a temporal artery thermometer (Exergen TAT-5000) and a rectal\n      thermometer (OMRON MC-341-E) in patients presenting to the Emergency Department at\n      Copenhagen University Hospital: Bispebjerg. The investigators hypothesize that there will be\n      an average difference of at least 0,3 degrees centigrade between those two types of\n      measurements (Bland-Altman). Based on a significance of 5% and a power of 80% the number of\n      patients was calculated to 385, including an estimated 10% dropout."
