            "textblock": "Elevated blood pressure (BP) and related cardiovascular complications are the leading causes\n      of morbidity and mortality in the modern world. In routine clinical practice, the\n      haemodynamic status is commonly assessed by measuring heart rate and blood pressure at rest,\n      which provides only limited information about functional haemodynamic status. In addition,\n      the haemodynamic changes resulting in similar elevations of BP may differ substantially\n      between patients and disorders.\n\n      Therefore, we investigated the haemodynamic changes in primary and secondary hypertension\n      and in the control subjects with non-invasive radial pulse wave analysis and whole-body\n      impedance cardiography. The method includes the determination of peripheral and central BP,\n      cardiac function, vascular resistance, arterial compliance and indices of pulse wave\n      reflection. Besides the measurements performed in the supine position, passive orthostatic\n      challenge is included to the protocol to assess functional haemodynamic status. In addition,\n      the effects of single doses of two largely endothelium-dependent agents, inhaled salbutamol\n      and intravenous L-arginine, and one endothelium-independent agent, sublingual nitroglycerin,\n      were investigated. The repeatability and reproducibility of the protocol was first examined\n      with a double-blind, randomized protocol in 35 subjects (methodological study group), and\n      after that the administration of research drugs has been open-label. The study population\n      consists of 7 subgroups, as described below. The study protocol of each subgroup has been\n      approved by the ethics committee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District (Ethics committee ID's\n      above), and the administration of research drugs has also been approved by the Finnish\n      Agency for Medicines (EudraCT-numbers above)."
