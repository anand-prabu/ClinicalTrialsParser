Our out-of-hospital study aims to demonstrate on one hand the superiority\n      of lorazepam compared with clonazepam and on the other hand the efficacy at least equivalent\n      of lorazepam in comparison with the association clonazepam + fosphenytoin. If these\n      hypotheses are demonstrated, the out-of-hospital treatment of the status epilepticus by\n      lorazepam in monotherapy would then be strongly recommended, considering its efficacy and\n      the simplicity of administration in the context of the pre-hospital emergency.Objective: To\n      compare the efficacy of Lorazepam with that of Clonazepam and its association with\n      Fosphenytoin for the treatment of out-of-hospital status epilepticus.\n\n      Participating centers:  38 prehospital emergency services employing mobile intensive care\n      units and located in urban areas in France participated in this study. In France, the\n      management of out-of-hospital medical emergencies is under the responsibility of the Service\n      d'Aide Medicale Urgente (SAMU). Mobile intensive care units are staffed by an attending\n      emergency physician or anesthesiologist, a nurse, and an ambulance driver. The study is\n      coordinated by the prehospital emergency service of Lariboisiere Hospital, University Paris\n      7 (Paris, France)\n\n      Number of patients: 522 patients; 174 patients by group.\n\n      Duration of the study: The total duration planned is of 24 months Intermediate analysis: An\n      intermediate analysis is planned while 261 patients will be included (50 % of the\n      inclusions).Duration of participation of every patient: 24 hours Data collection:\n      prehospital data recording during the 60 min period of the study, and intrahospital data\n      recording by the medical report of hospitalization.\n\n      Methodology: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial with 3 arms.\n\n      Main criteria of evaluation: the cessation of the status epilepticus and the absence of\n      recurrence from T20 minutes until T60 minutes after the beginning of the treatment.\n\n      The cessation of the status epilepticus is defined by the stop of any motor activity and any\n      seizures or convulsive movements. The absence of recurrence is defined by the not occurrence\n      of a new seizures after a period of cessation."
