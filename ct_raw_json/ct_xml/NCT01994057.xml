  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients of advanced NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer) , Individualized cancer therapy
      has been widely accepted since the success of crizotinib administration based on EML4-ALK
      fusion gene detection and gefitinib and erlotinib administration based on EGFR-TKIs
      sensitive mutations.From clinical points of view ,individual differences often occur between
      different patients, leading diverse effect in ADR and drug effect.Meanwhile ,the drug effect
      and adverse drug reaction was significantly influenced by the pharmacokinetic factors and
      pharmacodynamic factors.In this research ,we try to establish a more sensitive method to
      detect sensitive mutations in plasma and discover the correlation between somatic and
      germline mutations , trough concentration and EGFR-TKI drug effect, the association between
      ADME-associated SNP ,trough concentration and EGFR-TKI adverse effect .Furthermore, in vivo
      and in vitro research is also crucial for rational explanation for these clinical
      phenomenon.

      The ADME-associated SNPs included are CYP3A4,CYP3A4,CYP1A1,CYP2D6, ABCB1,ABCG2 and so on
      .The somatic mutations included are EGFR ,K-RAS ,ALK and so on

      1. FFPE samples of tissue needle biopsy were used for EGFR mutation detection.

        2. EDTA-whole blood was centrifuged at 4000rpm*10min,plasma was separated within four
           hours for somatic mutation detection.The remaining samples were used for germline
           mutation detection. All the blood samples were frozen in -80℃ until analysis.
