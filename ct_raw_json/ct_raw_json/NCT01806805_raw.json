            "textblock": "In \"dystonia\", the involuntary abnormal movements cause a driving handicap and a change of\n      the quality of life. A particular shape of dystonia, the Myoclonus Dystonia, is\n      characterized by the ascendancy of myoclonias (abrupt and brief movements) associated with\n      the abnormal dystonia. Myoclonus is an additional source of handicap in the movements of the\n      everyday life, because they distort the precision of movements. Response to oral medications\n      may be incomplete and the tolerance poor, such that deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is\n      useful for the major forms but it is also an invasive therapeutics which the operating risk\n      is not totally estimated in the absence of controlled study. Therefore, it is necessary to\n      investigate other pharmacological therapeutic tracks which present a good ratio profit /\n      risk.\n\n      Zonisamide is usually used in France in the epilepsy's treatment. It showed its efficiency\n      in the progressive myoclonus epilepsy, not only on the seizure but also on the myoclonia.\n      Therefore, it showed its efficiency on post-anoxic and propriospinal myoclonus. So, we make\n      the hypothesis that this medicine could bring a therapeutic profit in the Myoclonus\n      Dystonia.\n\n      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficiency of the zonisamide on the severity of\n      myoclonus (UMRS) at those patients. The others outcomes are to estimate the impact of the\n      treatment on the myoclonus's neurophysiological characteristics, the dystonia's severity\n      (BFM score), the quality of life (SF-36 and CGI scores), but also to investigate the\n      tolerance of the treatment.\n\n      We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period cross-over design to\n      evaluate the effect on severity of myoclonus in response to placebo or zonisamide (until 300\n      mg) in 32 patients.\n\n      The study includes an evaluation at the beginning and at the end of every period (4\n      evaluations at all). Each period includes a phase of titration (six weeks) followed by a\n      phase of fixed dose (three weeks). Those two periods are separated by a period of wash-out\n      (3 weeks) preceded by a phase of progressive decrease of doses (two weeks)."
