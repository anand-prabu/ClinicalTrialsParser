  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer often leads to lower levels of sexual desire,
      decreased sexual arousal, painful intercourse, and difficulties achieving orgasm, and thus
      adversely impacts sexual functioning and intimacy.  Despite the overwhelming evidence that
      many couples experience sexual distress following breast cancer, very few interventions have
      been designed exclusively to address these concerns. The purpose of this study is to develop
      and evaluate an online psychosexual program geared to the unique needs of couples
      experiencing sexual distress after breast cancer.  This study will utilize a web-based
      approach, allowing couples to participate in the program from the privacy and comfort of
      their homes, and providing a resource to couples who may not otherwise be able to readily
      access support.  Accordingly, this project has the potential for widespread positive impact
      for couples affected by breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many couples experience sexual problems following breast cancer treatment, and difficulties
      with intimacy and sexuality tend to extend past the 1 year post-treatment point. Given that
      resources available for couples who experience sexual distress after breast cancer are
      virtually non-existent, there is a need to develop and empirically evaluate psychosexual
      interventions for breast cancer patients and their partners.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, process, and outcomes of an
      online, couples-based intervention designed to address sexual problems encountered by many
      couples facing breast cancer. The intervention will take place in the form of six E-therapy
      sessions delivered via secure, encrypted videoconferencing software commonly used by health
      care providers practicing telemedicine.  Each session will be supplemented by
      psychoeducational materials (i.e. reading and/or video) available through a privately
      accessed homepage for the study.

      Twenty-five couples will participate in the intervention, and a repeated measures analysis
      of covariance will be undertaken to assess the treatment effect over time.  In addition to
      completing standardized questionnaires, couples will participate in pre- and post-treatment
      interviews, which will be analyzed thematically in order to improve the intervention and its
      delivery.

      The proposed project builds upon existing research pertaining to the sexual health
      implications of female cancer survivorship, and will fill a gap both in the literature and
      support available to breast cancer survivors experiencing sexual distress.  Given that
      sexual distress is such a crucial concern for women with breast cancer, and that the
      majority of couples experiencing sexual difficulties may not receive adequate support in
      this regard, the goal of the proposed project will be the creation of an accessible,
      cost-effective, empirically validated tool that could help improve the quality of life of
      couples affected by breast cancer.

Each session will focus on areas relevant to sex therapy and sexual dysfunction in couples facing breast cancer (e.g. education, communication, body imagery, sensate focusing, and problem solving).  Sessions will be one hour in length (Note: Session 1 will be 1.5 hours), during which couples will meet with a facilitator via videoconferencing.</description>
