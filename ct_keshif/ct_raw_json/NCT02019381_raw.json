Compare the effects above mentioned two intake guidelines on Vitamin D metabolism\n           [25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D] and bone turnover.\n\n      Participants will be randomly assigned to Group A or Group B based on different dosages of\n      study medications.\n\n      Group A:   10,000 IU (International Units)Vitamin D + Placebo (sugar pill) 600IU Vitamin D +\n      Two pills Calcium containing 600mg calcium each.\n\n      Group B:  600 IU Vitamin D + Placebo (sugar pill) 10,000 IU Vitamin D\n\n      + Two pills Calcium containing 600mg calcium each.\n\n      In addition to the calcium supplements, they will guide to include approximately 800mg of\n      calcium in their daily diet.\n\n      At visit 2, fasting blood and spot urine will be collected. A urinal will be dispensed for\n      collection of 24-hour urine for urinary calcium to be brought in next day. Study medication\n      will be dispensed and participants will be asked not to discard unused medications and to\n      bring all study medications next study visit.\n\n      Visit 3, 4, 5, 6 will essentially be the same as visit 2, with subjects returning unused\n      study medication and given new tablets each visit. Except on visit 6 no further study\n      medications will be dispensed, after collecting the previous supply.\n\n      Food frequency questionnaires will be filled out at the initial visit and final visit.  Diet\n      will be assessed using 3-day diet history form and Nutrition Pro analysis software.\n      Patients will be asked to refrain from taking other Vitamin D supplements and to continue\n      their usual calcium intake."
