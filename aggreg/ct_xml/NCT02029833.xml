  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to examine the health benefits of dietary canola oils on
      body composition, specifically on android fat, and weight management. COMIT II will also
      include analysis of FAEs to elucidate the mechanisms by which canola oil may be modifying
      body composition. Measurement of endothelial function using flow mediated dilation (FMD),
      and measurement of inflammatory, endothelial function, adiposity, and insulin sensitivity
      biomarkers will be done to determine the positive health impact of the changes in body
      composition achieved through canola oil consumption.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed multi-center clinical trial would engage the same collaborative team that
      successfully operationalized COMIT I, namely, the Richardson Centre for Functional Foods and
      Nutraceuticals (RCFFN) at the University of Manitoba, the L'Institut Des Nutraceutiques et
      des Aliments Fonctionnels (INAF) at Laval University in Quebec, the Department of
      Nutritional Sciences at Pennsylvania State University (PSU), the Risk Factor Modification
      Centre (RFMC) at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, as well as St. Boniface Research Centre
      at the University of Manitoba. The proposed COMIT II research program will proceed as a
      double blind, randomized crossover study consisting of three treatment phases of six weeks,
      each separated by a 6-week washout period. Participants will consume a fixed composition of
      a precisely controlled basal, weight-maintaining diet (35% energy from fat, 50% carbohydrate
      and 15% protein) supplemented with the following treatment oils: (a) regular canola oil, (b)
      high stability/ high oleic canola oil and (c) a typical &quot;Western diet&quot; fat intake as a
      control treatment comprised largely of saturated fat with substantial levels of omega-6
      linoleic acid, common to current North American intakes. Treatment oils will be
      isocalorically incorporated into fruit smoothies made with milk and consumed at breakfast
      and supper. The clinical segment of COMIT II is expected to be completed by the mid to end
      of the second year, with sample analyses to be completed by the end of year three.
