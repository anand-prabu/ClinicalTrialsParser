Treatment\n      continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. After 12 months, patients with responding or stable disease may continue\n      treatment.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for 2 years, every 3 months for the third and fourth\n      years, every 6 months for the fifth and sixth years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
