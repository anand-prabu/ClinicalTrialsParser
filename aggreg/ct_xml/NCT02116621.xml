  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain is an important problem, and treatments are often prescribed in
      a &quot;trial and error&quot; fashion. Clinicians prescribe a treatment to a patient and then wait and
      see if the treatment is successful. If the treatment is unsuccessful, they will try a
      different treatment. The disadvantage to this method is that it may take a long time to find
      a successful treatment.

      The purpose of the PREEMPT Study is to test whether using a mobile phone application
      (&quot;Trialist app&quot;) that allows patients and their health care providers to run personalized
      experiments comparing two pain treatments is more effective than usual care. Patients
      download the app, and working with their clinicians, set up a personalized trial that makes
      sense for them.  Every day they answer questions to track levels of pain and side effects of
      treatment, such as fatigue and constipation.  Once the personalized trial has ended, the
      responses to these daily questions on each treatment will be compared. During a regular
      clinic visit, the patient and the clinician will review visual displays of the results to
      facilitate treatment decision-making.  Approximately 250 patients will be enrolled in the
      study. Half the patients will use the app and review results with the clinician, and half
      the patients will continue with their regular care (i.e., will not use the app). The two
      groups will be compared to see if using the app is successful in improving long term pain
      outcomes. The goal of the intervention using the Trialist app is to help patients engage
      actively and collaboratively with their clinicians and identify effective treatments more
      quickly.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic musculoskeletal pain (e.g., neck, back, extremities) operationalized as pain
             present for 6 weeks or more and a pain score of 4 or higher (on a 0-to-10 scale) on
             at least one of three items from the PEG pain scale

          -  Age 18-75 years

          -  Own web-enabled Android or iOS phone with data plan

          -  In judgment of treating clinician, pain potentially amenable to treatment with
             acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose opioids, a
             complementary/alternative treatment such as massage or meditation, or a simple
             combination of these treatments

          -  Ability to speak and read English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treated with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy for cancer in past 5 years

          -  Other medical conditions that in clinician's judgment would limit life expectancy to
