Approximately 180\n      subjects will be treated with either Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols (120 subjects) or\n      Bovine Thrombin JMI\u00ae (60 subjects).  Subjects will be evaluated for identification of a\n      target bleeding site (TBS) in which control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques is\n      ineffective or impractical and requires an additional treatment to stop the bleeding.  The\n      Investigator (surgeon) will rate the intensity of bleeding at the TBS. Topical Thrombin\n      (Human) Grifols or Bovine Thrombin JMI will then be applied to the TBS and the amount of\n      bleeding at the TBS will be examined."
