  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate different dosages of risperidone ISM, a new
      long-acting injectable form.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will try to characterize and document the pharmacokinetics of
      risperidone ISM in schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients after one intramuscular
      injection at different dose strengths.Likewise, the safety and tolerability of risperidone
      ISM will be evaluated in the above mentioned population.

      Following confirmation of eligibility and a washout period for study-prohibited drugs, a
      total of 33 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular
      (IM) injection of one of the following dosages of study drug:

      Group 1: 50 mg risperidone ISM Group 2:  75 mg risperidone ISM Group 3: 100 mg risperidone
      ISM Several blood samples for plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be obtained
      pre-dose and post-dose. Safety assessments will be conducted at each pre-specified time
      points.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of an uncontrolled, unstable, clinically significant medical condition that
             in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the interpretation of safety
             and PK evaluations
