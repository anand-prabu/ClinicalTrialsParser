Each visit will be a\n      nutritional assessment including anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance, biochemical tests,\n      Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) and Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF).\n\n      Anthropometric measures to be taken are weight, height and arm circumference average.\n\n      Bioelectrical impedance will be using a single frequency impedance meter (425 to -50 KHz,\n      Range 0 to 10,000) Bioelectrical Body Composition Analyzer Quantium II RJL Systems. The team\n      measured the subjects' impedance, resistance, reactance and phase angle by Lean Body program\n      provided by the manufacturer.\n\n      Hepatic encephalopathy be evaluated by testing PHES and was measured CFF, also also be\n      measured ammonium, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, renin angiotensin aldosterone."
