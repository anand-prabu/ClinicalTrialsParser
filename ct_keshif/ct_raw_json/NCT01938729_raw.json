Both drugs are approved by the food\n      and drug administration (FDA) for treatment of liver cancer, but the two drugs have only\n      been combined in a few patients.\n\n      That means that in this trial we also want to find out if this combination is safe.\n\n      The study will also evaluate if this treatment works in delaying or stopping the cancer from\n      coming back after surgery."
