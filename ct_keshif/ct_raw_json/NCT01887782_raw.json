The Left dorsolateral\n      prefrontal cortex will be the site of stimulation in both treatment conditions.  The site of\n      stimulation will be targeted using MRI co-registration. The study seeks to determine if the\n      two treatment protocols have similar effectiveness in treating major depression."
