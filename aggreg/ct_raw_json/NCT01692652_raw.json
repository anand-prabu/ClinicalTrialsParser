These changes add to corneal damages and exacerbate ocular\n      symptoms, which are all associated with the constant release of inflammatory mediators. To\n      our knowledge, there has been no study on tear cytokine levels in MGD patients treated with\n      topical loteprednol etabonate. The investigators, thus, evaluated both inflammatory tear\n      cytokine levels and corresponding clinical outcomes for analyzing the efficacy of topical\n      loteprednol etabonate in moderate and severe MGD. The aim of this research was to determine\n      the concentration of inflammatory tear cytokines in patients with MGD and to compare the\n      changes in tear cytokine levels between topical loteprednol etabonate and warm compress\n      treatment group and warm compress only treatment group."

Briefly, 20 \u03bcL tear fluid was thawed and added to a 50 \u03bcL mixture containing each capture antibody-bead reagent and 50 \u03bcL detector antibody-phycoerithrin (Ab-PE) reagent. The mixture was subsequently incubated for 3 h at room temperature, and washed to remove unbound detector Ab-PE reagent before flow cytometry. Data were acquired and analyzed using BD CBA software that calculates the cytokine concentration based on the standard curves and a four-parameter logistic curve-fitting model. Flow cytometry was performed using the BDTM LSRII system (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA).",
