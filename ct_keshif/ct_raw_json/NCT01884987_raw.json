However,CRN was once regarded as a progressive and irreversible disease, no standard\n      therapy has been suggested for CRN. In our clinical practice, we have used\n      monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1)to treat CRN, and found that GM1 can successfully\n      reverse CRN. So we carried out this prospective study to test the efficacy of GM1 for CRN."
