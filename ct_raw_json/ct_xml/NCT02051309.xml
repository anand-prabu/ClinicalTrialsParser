    <textblock>
      Adult daily smokers motivated to quit smoking will be randomized to extended-release
      guanfacine (6mg/day) or placebo and will enroll in an 8-week treatment period combining
      medication with brief behavioral support. The investigators hypothesize that the active dose
      of guanfacine compared to placebo will increase rates of prolonged smoking abstinence at the
      end of the 8-week treatment phase.
