            "textblock": "The results of phase I Namisol\u00ae study (Klumpers et al. Br J Clin Pharmacol, 2012), implicate\n      that Namisol\u00ae may have a favorable PK and PD characteristics and is safe to use in people.\n      However, the study included only young adults with a mean age of 21.4 years. In a previous\n      THC study, subjects age has been associated with treatment response and tolerance of adverse\n      reactions. This association was not supported by Lane et al. and Volicer et al.\n\n      There is concern about the safety and tolerability of THC in the elderly population. This is\n      because, elderly persons in general have higher risk of adverse drug reactions due to a\n      combination of physiological factors such as decreasing in lean body mass, the reduction of\n      renal and hepatic clearance, and medical comorbidity which can lead to polypharmacy and\n      drug-drug interactions.  Therefore, data from the phase I trial cannot be translated\n      directly to an elderly (and likely more vulnerable) population. This makes it important to\n      evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles of different Namisol\u00ae doses in the elderly. In\n      our study in progress \"Delta-THC in Behavioral Disturbances in Dementia\", the Namisol\u00ae doses\n      of 0,75 mg and 1,5 mg are, until now, well tolerated by elderly subjects. These doses are,\n      however, very low in comparison with the doses used in phase I study with young adults (5\n      mg, 6,5 mg and 8 mg). The current study on the safety and tolerability of relatively high\n      doses of Namisol\u00ae will help us in the future to provide broad advice on the therapeutic\n      index and safety profile of Namisol\u00ae in the elderly population."
