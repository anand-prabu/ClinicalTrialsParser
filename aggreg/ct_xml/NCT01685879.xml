  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain types of rice have more dietary fiber than others.  This type of rice is known a
      &quot;high amylose rice.&quot;  This study hypothesizes that high-amylose rice, will decrease blood
      glucose and insulin responses after consumption compared to conventional rice in healthy
      adults, ages 18-40. Eighteen healthy men and women will participate in this study.  This
      study will determine how high blood glucose and insulin values rise after eating a portion
      of rice.  This study will also evaluate hunger ratings after consuming rice. The results of
      this study will help researchers better understand how diet can influence diabetes
      management.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess glucose response in humans to a rice sample prepared with
      high amylose rice (high amylose rice 1 and high amylose rice 2), compared to conventional
      rice and a glucose test beverage.

      Study Design: The proposed study is a randomized single-blind crossover design with repeated
      measures using human subjects (clinical study).

      Treatment:  The amount of resistant starch, a type of dietary fiber, is greater for high
      amylose varieties of rice than conventional varieties of rice. High amylose rice is
      commercially produced in Louisiana and Arkansas, USA. This specific rice has been bred to
      contain more amylose than ordinary (conventional) rice.  This food is not genetically
      modified.

      Brief Methods:  Study subjects (men and women) aged 18-40 years old will be recruited from
      the UH-Manoa campus and Honolulu area via flyers.  Interested individuals will be screened
      by telephone for initial eligibility (nonsmoker, non-vegetarian, habitual breakfast eater,
      able to fast for 12 hours, available 7:00am-10:00 am on weekdays, willing to participate in
      study).  Based on the initial phone screening, eligible study subjects will attend an
      enrollment visit to complete the consent form, obtain study materials, and confirm health
      status and eligibility based on subject inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Individuals who
      do not meet study eligibility will have all records destroyed.  18 healthy subjects (9 men
      and 9 women) will attend 4 morning study visits at the RMATRIX CRC at The Queens Medical
      Center.  Subjects will complete a 24-hour food record for the 24 hours prior to the study
      visit. Subjects will be fasted for 12 hours at the time of the study visit. Upon arrival,
      subjects will have an IV inserted for serial blood draws, fasting blood samples will be
      obtained (time = 0).  Subjects will then be presented one of four treatments in random
      order: high amylose rice-1, high amylose rice-2, conventional rice or glucose beverage.
      Subjects will be instructed to consume the sample or beverage within 15 minutes.  Blood
      samples will be taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.  Subjects will complete an
      appetite survey after each blood draw.  Upon completion of the study visit, subjects will be
      offered a snack and juice and monitored for safety.

      Study staff:  A graduate research assistant in the Nutrition graduate program will
      coordinate the clinical study.  Undergraduate research assistants will assist with study
      visits.  All students will be working under Dr. Stewart's supervision.  All study staff will
      complete UHM biosafety training, UMH blood borne pathogens training, and UMH or NIH human
      subjects training.

      Clinical Support:  The study will be supported by nursing staff from the RMATRIX PCR to
      perform IV catheter insertion, collect serial blood samples and monitor for adverse events.
