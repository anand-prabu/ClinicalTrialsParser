Unresectable advanced HCCs\n      are not suitable for other curative therapies. For these patients, the optimal treatment\n      remains largely controversial. As a palliative treatment, the benefit of transarterial\n      chemoembolization (TACE) had been shown in patients with unresectable HCC by several trials.\n      Recently,transarterial radioembolization (TARE) has been introduced for the treatment of\n      advanced HCC. However, the efficacy of TARE compared to TACE is uncertain.\n\n      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of conventional transarterial\n      chemoembolization(TACE) and transarterial radioembolization in patients with unilobar\n      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma."
