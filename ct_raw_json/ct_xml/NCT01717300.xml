    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of 2 different dose levels of anacetrapib on
      low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
      in participants with hypercholesterolemia  when added to an existing statin-modifying
      therapy.
