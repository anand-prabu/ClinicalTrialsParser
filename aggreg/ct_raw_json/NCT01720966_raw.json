            "textblock": "Rationale: Adhesion formation is a frequent complication after abdominal surgery. Adhesion\n      formation might be reduced by laparoscopic surgery, however sound evidence is lacking.\n      Colorectal surgery would be a good clinical model to investigate adhesion formation between\n      open and laparoscopic surgery because of the adhesion formation propensity of colorectal\n      surgery. However, a randomized controlled study to provide direct evidence is unlikely\n      because of large numbers of patients needed for such a trial and the difficulty to check for\n      adhesion formation at second surgery. Therefore we investigate adhesion formation after\n      laparoscopic and open colorectal surgery for malignancy at liver surgery for metastases.\n\n      Objective: The aim of our study is to compare the incidence of adhesions after laparoscopic\n      versus open surgery for colorectal malignancies during liver resection for colorectal\n      metastases.\n\n      Study design: The study is designed as a prospective observational cohort study.\n\n      Study population: All consecutive, adult patients undergoing laparotomy or laparoscopy for\n      intended liver resection or radio frequency ablation for liver metastases of a colorectal\n      malignancy in whom inspection of the middle and lower abdomen is possible to map adhesions.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints:\n\n        -  Primary endpoint is incidence of adhesions to the ventral abdominal wall around the\n           site of the original incision.\n\n        -  Secondary endpoints are episodes of bowel obstruction between index surgery and liver\n           surgery; total incidence of adhesions; extent of adhesions; Z\u00fchlke classification of\n           adhesions; performance of adhesiolysis; duration of adhesiolysis; peroperative\n           complications: enterotomy, seromuscular injury, inadvertent organ injury during\n           adhesiolysis; postoperative complications: delayed diagnosed perforation, SAE's.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group\n      relatedness: This study is an observational study. The existence of adhesions will be\n      assessed during laparotomy or laparoscopy for the treatment of liver metastases. The\n      laparotomy is indicated for medical treatment and should not be enlarged solely for the\n      assessment of adhesions nor will the operating time be influenced for this purpose.\n\n      Adhesions and peroperative complications have to be scored by the operating surgeon during\n      or directly after surgery. The postoperative complications have to be scored during the\n      postoperative course by the doctors on the ward. These assessments do not interfere with the\n      treatment of the patients."
