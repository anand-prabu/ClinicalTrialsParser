Compared\n      with general fatigue, CRF have the characteristics of long duration and generally cannot\n      alleviate by rest or sleep, serious impact on the patient's work, study, entertainment and\n      family life, and thus greatly affect the recovery, self-care ability and life quality of\n      patients. Many dates showed that 70%~100% of cancer patients experienced cancer-related\n      fatigue.For cancer-related fatigue there is no good treatment and intervention, in recent\n      years, many clinical trials are carried out; central nervous stimulant, such as\n      methylphenidate; acupuncture, aerobic exercise. All those measures may have certain\n      therapeutic effect for CRF, but don't have exact evidences from massive RCT to confirm.\n\n      Thymosin-\u03b11 (T-\u03b11), a synthetic 28-amino acid peptide with multiple biological activities\n      primarily directed towards immune response enhancement, this drug is used for the treatment\n      of HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, and being developed for the treatment of\n      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma, AIDS and malignant melanoma.\n      T-\u03b11 is able to potentiate the action of cytokines and also reduce the hematological\n      toxicity of cytotoxic drug therapy, such as cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, dacarbazine.\n\n      In this studies, we want to demonstrated that the effectiveness of Thymosin-\u03b11 for\n      cancer-related fatigue in cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy."
