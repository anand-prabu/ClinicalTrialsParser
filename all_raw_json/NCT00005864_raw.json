Assess the antitumor activity and toxicities of chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide\n      in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide IV over\n      1 hour weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed for at least 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months."
