  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate whether prophylactic oxytocin administered in the third stage of
      labor via intravenous (IV) infusion or IV bolus reduces the rate of postpartum hemorrhage
      compared to intramuscular (IM) injection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the effect of IV infusion or IV bolus to IM oxytocin administration
      with respect to mean blood loss and the proportion of women who experience blood loss
      greater than or equal to 500 ml, women who experience blood loss greater than or equal to
      350 ml, side effects, adverse events and change in hemoglobin pre- to post-delivery.
