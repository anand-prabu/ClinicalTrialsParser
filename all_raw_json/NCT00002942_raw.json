Combining chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow\n      transplantation or peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher\n      doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare bone marrow transplantation with peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation following carboplatin in treating patients with breast cancer."

Compare engraftment rates using G-CSF primed autologous bone marrow vs PBCP\n      as hematopoietic support following high dose CTCb for patients with poor prognosis breast\n      cancer. II. Compare the complications of these two methods of hematopoietic progenitor cell\n      collections. III. Compare Stage IV patients with bone or bone marrow involvement (assigned\n      to PBPC collections) with Stage IV patients randomized to PBPC collections relative to the\n      number of leukaphereses needed to collect the required number of progenitor cells as well as\n      assess engraftment rates between these two groups. IV. Assess the response to high dose CTCb\n      in this group of patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients will receive G-CSF priming therapy for 5 consecutive days. Patients\n      will then be randomized into two treatment arms: Arm 1 consists of autologous PBPC\n      collection Arm 2 consists of autologous bone marrow collection Within 2 weeks after\n      progenitor cell collection, all patients will receive high dose CTCb therapy by continuous\n      infusion for 5 days, followed by autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell infusion at least\n      three days later. G-CSF will also be given after infusion until ANC count is over 5,000 or\n      over 1,000 for 3 consecutive days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 66 patients will be accrued at a rate of 24 per year."
