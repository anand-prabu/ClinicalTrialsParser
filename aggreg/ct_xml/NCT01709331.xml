      This study will assess if MK-8962, when administered in combination with human chorionic
      gonadotropin (hCG), will increase testicular volume in men with HH who remain azoospermic
      after treatment with hCG alone.

             than the study medication, drugs that are known to impair testicular function, agents
             known to affect sex hormone secretion and/or drugs that are known or suspected to be
             teratogenic

          -  Used any investigational drugs within three months or actively participating in
             another study
