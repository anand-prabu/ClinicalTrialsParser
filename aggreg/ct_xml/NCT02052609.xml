      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term exposure to KHK4827
      in subjects with plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic erythroderma) who have
      completed Study 4827-003 (Study 003)and in subjects with pustular psoriasis (generalized) or
      psoriatic erythroderma who have completed the Study 4827-004 (Study 004).
