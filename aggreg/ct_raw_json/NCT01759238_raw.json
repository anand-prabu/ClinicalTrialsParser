            "textblock": "Combining chemoradiation with an antiangiogenic agent has a strong biological rationale, and\n      preclinical studies consistently show an increase in radiosensitization with combined\n      treatment. It is well described that hypoxia or HIF-1 expression is associated with a lower\n      radiation response and progression in solid tumors. Radiation itself induces transient tumor\n      hypoxia, which in turn stimulates VEGF production and VEGFR-2 expression what may also serve\n      as a paracrine proliferative stimulus that promotes out-of-field growth. The combination of\n      radiotherapy with an antiangiogenic agent (e.g. bevacizumab) thus offers the potential to\n      enhance the effect of radiation, and avoid further spread of disease. Furthermore, targeting\n      tumor vasculature improves the delivery of cytotoxic drugs (e.g. capecitabine) leading to\n      increased efficacy of chemoradiation. Combination with cytotoxic drugs could additionally\n      limit treatment-induced hypoxia (Senan and Smit 2007; Mazeron, Anderson et al. 2011)."
