It is aimed at helping patients re-engage with several\n      life areas that they may have lost in the course of depressive illness.  The intervention is\n      centred on behavioural activation (BA) with complementary interventions including recreation\n      activities, and behavioural modifications. The study question is: in patients with\n      depressive disorder attending a specialized hospital based mood disorders clinic, does the\n      addition of behavioural activation program delivered in a group format improve depressive\n      symptoms and quality of life compared to treatment as usual after 18 weeks of treatment?\n      Study investigators hypothesize that behavioural activation is an effective treatment for\n      depressive disorder in patients with depression."

Based on the analysis of qualitative data\n      pertaining to the first topic, the behavioural activation program may be modified for the\n      main trial, to respond to patient needs and feedback, in the spirit of delivering truly\n      patient centered care. The qualitative study will involve multiple interviews and focus\n      groups which will take place before, during, and after the pilot intervention period."
