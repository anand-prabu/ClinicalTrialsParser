What the investigators do not know is how\n      this process is affected when the dose of the metformin is increased or changed.\n\n      Currently the same doses of metformin are often used in both children and adults, but it is\n      possible that the dose of metformin should be based on age and weight.  Understanding how\n      CBP works could potentially help us to tailor metformin treatment individually for patients\n      based on their age, weight and CBP response."
