            "textblock": "Flupirtine is a centrally acting analgesic drug. Its mechanism of action differs obviously\n      from opiates because flupirtine antagonizes the morphine-induced tail phenomenon in mice in\n      relatively low doses. The drug exerts no relevant anesthetic activity and it has only slight\n      inhibitory effect on prostaglandin formation in animals. As major action mechanism,\n      activation of descending noradrenergic neuronal pathways is discussed, thereby inhibiting\n      afferent nociceptive stimuli on spinal, subcortical and cortical brain areas. Recently has\n      been shown, that flupirtine exhibits functional NMDA receptor antagonistic properties by\n      selective opening the neuronal potassium channel.\n\n      The anticonvulsant drug retigabine, which chemical structure only slightly differs from\n      flupirtine (aromatic ring instead of the pyrimidine ring), is subjected to intensive\n      glucuronidation and N-acetylation in man. In-vitro, retigabine is a substrate of the\n      recombinant uridine glucoronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1, 1A3, 1A4 and 1A9. Disposition of\n      retigabine, however, was not influenced by the frequent UGT1A1*28 polymorphism\n      (Gilbert-Meulengracht syndrome) whereas the polymorphism of the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2)\n      resulted in significant changes in retigabine disposition.\n\n      Similar to retigabine, the carbamate group of flupirtine is hydrolyzed by carboxyl\n      esterases. The decarbamylated product undergoes N-acetylation to form the major metabolite\n      D13223. This acetylation is catalyzed in-vitro both by recombinant human NAT2 and NAT1.\n      Furthermore, relatively stable quinone diimines for flupirtine and D13223 as catalyzed by\n      peroxidases were detectable in in-vitro experiments. After repeated oral administration of\n      flupirtine in man, quinone diimines and glutathione adducts of them in the form of\n      mercapturic acid conjugates were detected.\n\n      Therefore, we hypothesize, that highly reactive diimine radicals may appear as intermediates\n      which are detoxified by conjugation with glutathione via a glutathione S-transferase (GST).\n      Diimine intermediates are known to have high cell toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity\n      as shown for the intermediates of acetaminophen. By analogy to acetaminophen, the GSTP1\n      might be the isoform that is involved also in detoxification of flupirtine intermediates.\n\n      According to our hypothesis, the net appearance of toxic intermediates with diimine\n      structure in hepatocytes is dependent on the activity of NAT1/NAT2, UGTs and GSTP1. Because\n      NAT2, UGT1A1 and GSTP1 are highly polymorphic enzymes, the risk of flupirtine hepatotoxicity\n      may be dependent on the genotype of the subjects that are treated with the drug.\n\n      Our clinical study was initiated to confirm, whether polymorphisms of NAT2, UGT1A1 and GSTP1\n      may significantly influence disposition and analgesic effect of flupirtine and whether the\n      genetic background is of risk for the appearance of toxic intermediates and its stable\n      terminal conjugates."
