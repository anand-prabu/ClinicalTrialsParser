  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women with breast cancer who are treated with aromatase inhibitor medications develop
      difficulty sleeping and fatigue during treatment. Some examples of aromatase inhibitor
      medications include anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara).
      Frequently, sleeping pills do not work very well to improve sleep. Cyclobenzaprine
      (Flexeril) is a medication that was originally developed to treat muscle spasms. It may also
      improve sleep in patients with chronic pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia. In this study
      we are testing to see if cyclobenzaprine at bedtime will help improve sleep in women treated
      with aromatase inhibitors.
