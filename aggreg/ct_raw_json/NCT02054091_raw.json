            "textblock": "Feeding preterm infants is of great challenge in the NICUs. Mother's own milk is considered\n      as the best for the digestive system followed by donor milk. Preterm infant formula is\n      related to more feeding problems and other gut complications in these babies, such as\n      necrotizing enterocolitis. Bovine colostrum contains higher amounts of protein, growth\n      factors and immuno-regulatory components (e.g. immunoglobulins), which has been used in many\n      other situations to promote health. The investigators plan to give bovine colostrum to\n      preterm infants with birth weights between 1000 and 1800 g, in order to promote feeding and\n      intestinal health in these babies. This current study is a feasibility pilot study and the\n      investigators hypothesized that Supplementing BC to MM (if available) is safe and tolerable\n      when used within the first 10 days of life in preterm infants with birth weights between\n      1000 and 1800 g."

            "textblock": "Preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) occurs in 10% of all pregnancies worldwide and the\n      optimal way to feed a newborn preterm infant, when breast-feeding is impossible, is not\n      clear. Excessive enteral feeding predisposes to various complications and necrotizing\n      enterocolitis (NEC) that occur in 7% of preterm infants born with less than 1500 g body\n      weight. Minimal enteral nutrition (MEN) is a widely used method where small volumes of milk\n      are fed within the first few days after birth with the purpose to promote GIT maturation and\n      add some nutrients and energy. It is assumed that MEN feedings allow more rapid advancement\n      to full enteral feeding (EN, e.g 120-160 ml/kg/d) and weaning from parenteral nutrition\n      (PN). This is important to reduce PN-related complications (e.g. sepsis) and to better\n      stimulate body and organ (e.g. gut, brain) development. However, it remains unclear what is\n      the best milk diet when mother's own milk is not available. Infant formula (IF) and banked\n      human donor milk (DM) are the most frequently used alternatives to mother\u00b4s own milk (MM).\n      MM is superior to IF in promoting feeding tolerance, body growth, intestinal function, and\n      NEC resistance in preterm infants. Feeding with DM is also believed to be beneficial,\n      relative to IF, although this pasteurized milk obtained from mothers later in lactation may\n      less beneficial, relative to the first MM, colostrum. There are differences in the amount\n      and composition between human colostrum and bovine colostrum (BC), but relative to mature\n      human milk, BC contains higher amounts of protein, growth factors and immuno-regulatory\n      components (e.g. immunoglobulins). Large amount of protein in BC provides higher enteral\n      protein intake and may enable a reduction in the use of PN and central venous catheters, and\n      hereby reduced risk of infection. Also this may lead to reduced weight loss and improved\n      growth of the brain and the body. In addition, maturational and NEC-protective effects of BC\n      have repeatedly been documented in preterm pigs when BC is used as the first diet after\n      birth. The investigators therefore plan to investigate whether using BC as MEN for preterm\n      infants is safe, tolerable, and helps to provide nutrients and gut maturation in preterm\n      infants, when MM is not in sufficient amounts or not available."
