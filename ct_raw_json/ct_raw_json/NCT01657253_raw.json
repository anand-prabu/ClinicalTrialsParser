Artificial tears are one of the primary treatments for dry\n      eye; it is mainly palliative and focuses on reducing the symptoms of discomfort to improve\n      quality of life for a patient.\n\n      A phase III randomized double-blind clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate efficacy\n      and safety of the ophthalmic solution PRO-148 in the ocular surface of patients with mild to\n      moderate dry eye compared with ophthalmic solution Systane\u00ae. Patients will be randomized to\n      receive one of the treatments for 60 days. Efficacy and safety measures will be performed at\n      baseline and at 60 days after treatment"
