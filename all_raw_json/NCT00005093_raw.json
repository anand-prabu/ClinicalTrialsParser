Patients\n      are stratified according to performance status and are randomized to one of two treatment\n      arms. Arm I: Patients receive CI-994 orally on days 1-21 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes\n      on days 1, 8, and 15. Arm II: Patients receive placebo capsules orally on days 1-21 and\n      gemcitabine as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 28 days as long as medically appropriate\n      (absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity).\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 176 patients will be accrued for this study."
