  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients suffering from non valvular atrial
      fibrillation is derived from studies regarding recurrences of atrial fibrillation after
      catheter ablation. Prospective studies in european countries are stil lacking. Furthermore
      the impact of metabolic syndrome on cardiovascular events in patients with non valvular
      atrial fibrillation is still unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia that is associated with a
      high risk of cardiovascular events and increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular
      events are prevalently localized in the cerebral circulation in which AF is responsible for
      ischemic stroke. Clinical characteristics of ischemic stroke from AF are almost severe and
      thromboembolism is considered the most important cause. Thus, ischemic stroke is deemed to
      origin from thrombus formation generated in the left atrium with ensuing  embolism in the
      cerebral circulation.

      Patients with AF are typically associated with different risk factors of atherothrombosis
      including, overall, hypertension which may be detected in about 70-80% of the population;
      other risk factors are diabetes and  dyslipidemia. This accounts for instrumental evidence
      of systemic atherosclerosis associated to AF.  Thus, signs of atherosclerosis have been
      detected in the thoracic aorta, as represented by aortic plaque assessed by trans-esophageal
      echocardiography; patients with complex aortic plaque had fourfold increased rate of stroke
      compared to plaque-free patients.

      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of atherosclerotic risk factors including,
      according to the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III
      (NCEP-ATPIII), hypertension, low HDL, impaired glycaemic control, hypertriglyceridemia  and
      central obesity as assessed by waist circumference; the presence of MetS is associated with
      an increased risk of developing cardiac and cerebral ischemic events.

      An higher risk to develop atrial fibrillation (AF) has been well recognized in patients with
      MetS.  In a prospective, community-based, observational cohort study with annual health
      check-up 28449 subjects without AF the age-adjusted rates of AF were higher in subjects with
      compared  to those without metabolic syndrome during a mean follow-up of 4.5 years.

      Few studies reported on the  prevalence of MetS in AF population are still lacking. Some
      data can be inferred from studies  regarding recurrence of AF after catheter ablation
      reporting a prevalence  ranging from 18.8% to 49.4% . The only population study so far
      published included 741 chinese patients and reported a  prevalence of the MetS in AF  of
      46.3%. Taking into account  the different thresholds of waist circumferences recommended by
      international societies for different ethnic groups, it is unclear if such prevalence can be
      extrapolated to population of western countries. Furthermore the impact of MetS on the
      incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with non valvular AF (NVAF) taking oral
      anticoagulant therapy (OAT) has never been investigated.

      Therefore, our aim has been to investigate the prevalence of MetS in a population of NVAF
      patients under oral coagulation treatment and its impact on cardiovascular events during a
      prospective study.
