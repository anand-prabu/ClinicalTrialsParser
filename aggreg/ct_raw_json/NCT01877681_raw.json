The chronic wound care by skilled personnel is key to healing and\n      management of these injuries. An inter-clinical telematic program for PU in Primary Care\n      (PC) can improve the effectiveness of interventions and cost savings.\n\n      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and costs reduction after the implementation in PC\n      setting of a chronic wounds reference nurse and a teleconsultation program aimed to nurses\n      for the management of PU in patients in home care setting.\n\n      Methodology: A prospective controlled clinical trial in which 46 primary care nurses in\n      Osakidetza will be randomly assigned to two parallel groups: experimental group and control\n      group. Each nurse will recruit from2 to 4 new patients in home care with PU in stage II-III.\n      The intervention will consist of a telematic advice from the reference nurse regarding\n      chronic wound management in relation to a specific PU. Patients will be monitored for 16\n      weeks with a minimum of 8 repeated measurements of the Resvech Index 2.0. To evaluate the\n      effectiveness of the intervention, multilevel models or linear mixed models to take into\n      account the auto-correlation at the individual level and nurse, will be used"
