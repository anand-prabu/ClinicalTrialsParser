  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will elucidate how the parental origin of the X-chromosome influences health
      status as well as metabolic fate in Klinefelter patients. Epigenetics and
      transcriptome-research will be directly linked to the metabolic and inflammatory pattern of
      actual patients to improve care for them. The Klinefelter Syndrome is one of the most common
      genetic disorders in men. The patients have one supernumerary X-chromosome, which is partly
      active and disturbs a normal male development. Testosterone deficiency in form of primary
      hypogonadism is a common feature in these men. Such a condition promotes clinically relevant
      metabolic patterns related to a pro-inflammatory status and diabetes mellitus type 2
      (insulin resis-tance), cardiovascular disease as well as infertility. However, the variety
      of pathologies is pro-nounced between patients and low testosterone concentrations cannot
      fully explain the wide scope of pathologies in these men. Some patients become clinically
      obvious during puberty and adoles-cence, some in their thirties or later and all exhibit a
      huge variation in phenotype. Switching on and off of specific genes on the X-chromosome is
      differential, depending on the origin either from the maternal or paternal side. Hence, an
      influence on the clinical picture is hypothesised. Thus, key targets are clarification of
      the parental origin of the supernumerary X chromosome and elucidation of methylation and
      expression profile of pivotal X-chromosomal genes. These will be related to clinically
      relevant metabolic and inflammatory patterns as well as fertility to identify individual
      risks as well as treatment strategies for Klinefelter patients.
