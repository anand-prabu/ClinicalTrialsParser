(Phase I of this study\n           closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.)\n\n        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n        -  Assess the activity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n        -  Estimate peripheral blood carmustine levels in these patients treated with this\n           regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive carmustine in ethanol (DTI-015) intratumorally over 5 minutes during\n      stereotactic biopsy or open craniotomy.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of DTI-015 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I of this study closed to accrual as of\n      01/15/2002.)\n\n      Additional patients then receive treatment with DTI-015 at the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and then every 1-3 months until disease\n      progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients were accrued for phase I of this study and\n      approximately 14-18 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study. (Phase I of this\n      study closed to accrual as of 01/15/2002.)"
