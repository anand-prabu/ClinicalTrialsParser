Determine\n      whether the degree of inhibition of FTase activity and farnesylation of lamin-B, H-, K-, and\n      N-RAS in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor tissue correlates with tumor response\n      in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine whether the presence of activating RAS\n      mutations in myeloma cells predicts treatment response in patients treated with this\n      regimen. IV. Correlate R115777 plasma levels and RAS mutation status with tumor response in\n      patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed\n      for at least 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 25\n      months."
