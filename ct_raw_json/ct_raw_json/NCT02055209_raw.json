This resource will\n      enable our team to test the working hypothesis that race-ancestry differences in the burden\n      of cardiovascular disease (CVD) reflects the influence of a unique interplay between the\n      distinct genomic variation characteristic of African-Americans (AA) and the    exposome\n      of social determinants and environmental factors that influence the pathogenesis of CVD in\n      AA. The specific aims are:\n\n      AIM I. To examine the associations between common or ancestry-related DNA variants and CVD\n      risk factors (e.g. hypertension) and phenotypes (e.g. coronary artery calcification) in\n      African-Americans (AA).\n\n      AIM II. To examine the associations between health behaviors or social-environmental factors\n      and CVD risk factors and phenotypes in AA.\n\n      The study is designed to create a cohort amenable to nested case-control analyses based on a\n      community-based sampling frame with a target size of approximately 1800 self-identified,\n      U.S. - born, African-American (AA) men and women (ages 21-65) to be recruited over the next\n      5-6 years from the metropolitan Washington DC, Montgomery County (MC) and Prince George   s\n      County (PG) areas. The participant recruitment strategy will involve two complementary\n      approaches: 1) we will contract with a well-established survey group (Southern Research\n      Group) to conduct a random-digit telephone screening survey targeting study-eligible AA that\n      will be consented and invited to an evaluation visit in the NIH Clinical Center; and 2) we\n      will conduct a community outreach effort to recruit participants into the Clinical Center by\n      leveraging the engagement of community-based leaders, organizations and faith-based\n      institutions in the area. Given the high burden of CVD among AA, this approach will yield a\n      sample with normal individuals as well as a high proportion of AA with CVD risk factors such\n      as obesity and hypertension that predispose to the eventual clinical signs and symptoms of\n      CVD (e.g. heart attack and stroke). Based on previous epidemiology studies, this protocol\n      s participant ascertainment approach and the target demographic profile; it is anticipated\n      that the prevalence of clinically manifest CVD (history of angina, heart attack or stroke)\n      will be less than 10-15% of the sample. All participants (either ascertained by random\n      telephone survey or community outreach) will undergo extensive evaluation in the Clinical\n      Center that includes: medical evaluation (e.g. anthropometrics, blood pressure), laboratory\n      tests (e.g. lipid levels, kidney function), social determinants profiles (e.g. socioeconomic\n      status (SES), perceived stress, discrimination, depression, perceived neighborhood\n      characteristics), blood/urine collection for deep-sequencing based    omic    analyses\n      (whole exome sequencing, and RNA-Seq), as well as testing for    pre-clinical   , biomarkers\n      of the pathobiological processes of CVD or    CVD phenotypes    (e.g. coronary artery\n      calcification, microalbuminuria, leukocyte telomeres, or vascular dysfunction). It is\n      anticipated that these deep sequencing efforts will yield novel ancestry-related DNA\n      variants associated with the CVD phenotypes; yet with unclear biological significance in\n      elucidating racial disparities in CVD. Accordingly, our protocol also includes a\n      Genotype-to-Phenotype    (G2P) component that re- contacts subsets of the cohort based on\n      their genotype (e.g. APOL1 chronic kidney disease risk alleles) for a    call-back    visit\n      for more in-depth phenotyping and characterization of the potential effect of the DNA\n      variant of interest on human systems biology. In some cases family members of the proband\n      may also be invited to participate in these G2P studies to further characterize the\n      biological significance of these putative functional DNA variants of interest.\n\n      The primary outcome variables involve well established CVD phenotypes: 1) CVD risk factors\n      (e.g. hypertension, dyslipidemia), 2) markers of pre-clinical CVD (i.e. coronary artery\n      calcification, coronary plaque burden by cardiac CT angiography (CTA), carotid plaque burden\n      by 3D ultrasound, vascular dysfunction, microalbuminuria, C-reactive protein, Vitamin D\n      levels). The protocol will assess exposures associated with CVD and relevant covariates\n      including: 1) social determinants (SES, perceived stress, discrimination, and depression);\n      2) environmental factors such as neighborhood characteristics (geospatial features of\n      healthy lifestyles [e.g. walkability]) and 3) behavioral factors (e.g. diet, physical\n      activity).
