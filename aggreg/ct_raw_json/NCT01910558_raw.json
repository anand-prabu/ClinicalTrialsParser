The purpose of the research is to evaluate this effect of \u03b1-\n      cyclodextrin. It is hypothesized that alpha cyclodextrin supplementation will increase fecal\n      fat on a high saturated fat diet compared to the same diet supplemented with a digestible\n      carbohydrate control"

In humans, supplementation with \u03b1-cyclodextrin has been\n      shown to lead to a significant weight loss regardless of whether energy intake was\n      maintained or increased.The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of a 72 hour fecal\n      fat test using stool markers on the last three days of each of three six-day feeding\n      periods. Subjects will be served a weight maintaining diet containing 40% fat (of which 40%\n      will be saturated), 30% protein and 30% carbohydrate for 18 days.  Subjects will also\n      consume 1 gram alpha cyclodextrin with 1 gram of starch, 2 grams of alpha cyclodextrin, or 2\n      grams of starch in capsule form before breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day in each of the\n      three six-day feeding periods. At this dose, alpha-cyclodextrin is recognized as safe by the\n      FDA. All stools will be collected over a 72 hour period at the end of each feeding period\n      and analyzed for fecal fat excretion."
