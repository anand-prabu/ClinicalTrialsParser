            "textblock": "Denmark has a higher incidence of cervical cancer than other Nordic countries, although all\n      Danish women (aged 23-65) are screened regularly to identify possible cervical dysplasia or\n      asymptomatic invasive cancer.\n\n      Annually 40 000 women receives an abnormal or inadequate test result and a follow-up\n      recommendation.\n\n      However problems with delayed follow-up may threaten the effectiveness of the Danish\n      Cervical Cancer Screening Program, as 20% of women are delayed and dysplasia potentially can\n      progress into cancer.\n\n      Delayed follow-up is found in situations where women either consciously or unconsciously\n      postpone follow-up, or because of organizational aspects of the screening program, where\n      communication regarding test results can fail either in content or with delay.This study\n      will evaluate two interventions designed to increase follow-up:\n\n        1. A letter with the test result and potential recommendation for follow up will be sent\n           to the women (RCT). The intention is to ensure that all women will be notified about\n           the test result, quickly, homogenously and in layman's written language, still with the\n           opportunity to contact or be contacted by the general practitioner, if there is special\n           needs. Furthermore, it is assumed that general practitioner consultations regarding\n           delivery of normal test results will decrease, so that cost savings is a potential side\n           benefit\n\n        2. Electronic reminder to the general practitioner if women have not had the recommended\n           follow up, giving the general practioner\u00b4s an opportunity to remind the women (retro\n           perspective cohort study).\n\n      The results will be of great importance to the future organisation of cervical and\n      colorectal cancer screening programmes in Denmark, but will also have international interest\n      because of their similar challenges."
