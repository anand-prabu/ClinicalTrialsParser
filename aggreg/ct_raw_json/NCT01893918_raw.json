Each patient will perform pulmonary\n      function test, including reversibility to inhaled bronchodilator (400 mcg albuterol), and\n      6-minute walk test.

In addition, each patient will undergo chest X-ray, thorax\n      CT scan, echocardiography, and carotid ultrasonography.\n\n      At enrollment, all patients will be in stable condition (no changes in medication dosage or\n      frequency, no COPD exacerbation or hospital admissions in the previous 4 weeks).
