          -  Prior therapy (&gt; 28 days) with exemestane in the metastatic setting (Patients

             1 year after treatment discontinuation are eligible);

          -  Requires treatment for tuberculosis or HIV infection;

          -  Radiation therapy within 7 days before randomization;

          -  History of another invasive cancer within 5 years before randomization;

          -  Treatment with any oral anticancer or  with any non-hormonal anticancer agent within
             14 days before randomization;

          -  Treatment with any approved or investigational agent that blocks androgen synthesis
             or targets the androgen receptor;

          -  Treatments with any  of the following medications within 14 days before
             randomization: Estrogens, Androgens, or Systemic radionuclides;

          -  Hypersensitivity reaction to exemestane.
