Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to\n      kill cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy with interleukin-2 and GM-CSF may be a more\n      effective treatment for kidney cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of low-dose interleukin-2, vinblastine,\n      and GM-CSF in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer."

Determine the effect of sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage\n      colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) in combination with interleukin-2 and vinblastine on the\n      response rate of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. II. Assess the potential\n      toxicities of this treatment combination in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a single arm, nonrandomized study. Patients receive vinblastine as an IV\n      bolus once every 2 weeks. Interleukin-2 is administered by subcutaneous injection on days\n      1-5 each week for 9 weeks. Sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor;\n      GM-CSF) is administered by subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 each week for 9 weeks. Each 9\n      week cycle is followed by 3 weeks of rest. Patient may continue treatment for a maximum of 5\n      cycles in the absence of disease progression. Patients are assessed every 12 weeks for the\n      duration of treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20-35 patients will be accrued into this study."
