A retrospective chart review of dialysis patients including referred cases, receiving\n           surgical PTX, which was performed by one surgeon at the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital,\n           a 1084-bed tertiary-care medical center in northern Taiwan will be performed.\n\n        2. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone were routinely\n           measured for three consecutive post-operative days and subsequent laboratory values\n           were checked during out-patient follow-up period. Patients with postoperative 6-month\n           laboratory data are included in the short-term group and those with more than 6-month\n           available data are in the long-term one.\n\n        3. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-K/DOQI\u2122)\n           Clinical Practice Guidelines provided recommended target values for serum intact\n           parathyroid hormone (iPTH)(150-300 pg/ml), phosphorus (3.5-5.5 mg/dl), calcium (8.4-9.5\n           mg/dl) and the calcium-phosphorus product (<55 mg2/dl2). The Kidney Disease: Improving\n           Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines suggested maintaining serum\n           calcium in the reference range (8.5-10.5 mg/dl), phosphorus (2.7-4.5 mg/dl) and PTH\n           values in the range of two to nine times the upper reference limit (130 - 585 pg/ml) in\n           dialysis patients.\n\n        4. The investigators evaluated the impact of subtotal PTX on the control of bone and\n           mineral parameters in dialysis patients with secondary HPT as the percentages of cases\n           achieving the recommended K/DOQI and KDIGO targets."
