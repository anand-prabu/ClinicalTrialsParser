Combining chemotherapy with a peripheral stem cell transplant\n      and immunotherapy may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells. Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system\n      and stop cancer cells from growing.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving chemotherapy together with a peripheral stem\n      cell transplant followed by immunotherapy to see how well it works in treating patients with\n      chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia."

Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected by leukapheresis when blood cell counts\n      have recovered.\n\n      Approximately 2-3 weeks later, high-dose chemotherapy begins. Patients receive gemcitabine\n      IV over 100 minutes on day -5, carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2, followed 6 hours later\n      by gemcitabine IV again, and melphalan IV over 20 minutes on day -1. CD34 selected PBSCs are\n      infused on day 0, at least 18 hours after melphalan administration. Patients receive GM-CSF\n      SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood cell counts recover.\n\n      Patients then receive ex vivo expanded autologous T cells on day 14 after\n      autotransplantation. Interferon alfa is administered three times a week starting about 3\n      months after transplantation.\n\n      Patients who only receive expanded T cells, without high-dose chemotherapy and\n      autotransplantation, but show no response after 3 months, may proceed to autotransplantation\n      followed by a second ex vivo expanded T-cell infusion.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-22 patients will be accrued for this study."
