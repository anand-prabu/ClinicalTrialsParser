    <description>The IGA score is a static evaluation of the overall or &quot;average&quot; degree of severity of a subject's disease, taking into account all of the subject's psoriatic lesions. &quot;Treatment success&quot; is defined as a score of 0 or 1 representing &quot;cleared&quot; or &quot;almost cleared&quot; at Day 15 with at least a two grade decrease in severity score relative to Baseline. IGA is measured on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe/very severe).</description>

    <description>A static assessment of the overall or &quot;average&quot; degree of severity of each of three key characteristics present within all of the subject's psoriatic lesions. &quot;Treatment success&quot; is defined as a score of 0 or 1 representing &quot;cleared&quot; or &quot;almost cleared&quot; at Day 15 with at least a two grade decrease in severity score relative to Baseline.

    <description>Pruritus scale will be used to assess the subjective and multidimensional experience of the subject's pruritus (itching) during the previous two weeks at Baseline and Day 15. Possible scores range from 5 (no pruritus) to 25 (most severe pruritus).</description>

    <description>The investigator will use the assumption that 1% BSA is approximately equal to the surface area of the subject's palm and fingers, with the fingers extended yet grouped together, creating a flat oval-like surface area.</description>
