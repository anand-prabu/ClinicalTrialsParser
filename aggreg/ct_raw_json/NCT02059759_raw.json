Co-occuring functional changes will also be described, as\n      well as effects on T-cells and pNFH serum levels for exploratory purposes.\n\n      This is a phase II study on ld-IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for ALS which aims at defining\n      the activity and safety of a range a doses for subsequent use of the best dose in a phase\n      II/III trial. For ethical reasons, ld-IL-2 must be tested as an add-on therapy to riluzole\n      hence all patients will need to be treated with riluzole for at least three months prior to\n      entry. A randomized (1:1:1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial will\n      be carried out to assess ld-IL-2 activity on regulatory T cells and immuno-inflammatory\n      markers in ALS patients treated for 3 months (5 days per month).\n\n      Follow-up will last for 6 months. Blood will be drawn for laboratory analyses regularly\n      throughout the trial. Safety will be assessed via the recording of all adverse events .\n      Certain adverse events commonly found in the scientific literature will be queried directly\n      by participating investigators at follow-up visits. Patients will also be asked to maintain\n      an adverse event journal throughout the study.\n\n      \"Day 1\" refers to the day of the first injection."
