The present protocol is designed to improve survival in the high risk\n      group by using alternating non-cross resistant drug regimens.  We plan to determine whether\n      using granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in this group would increase\n      dose-intensity and ameliorate myelotoxicity.  We also plan to study the effect on survival\n      of decreasing the duration of treatment to three months from the present year-long therapy\n      in low-risk patients."
