Assess the toxicity and\n      pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Assess the\n      response to this regimen by patients with measurable disease.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive lurtotecan liposome\n      (NX211) IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, and 3. Courses are repeated every 3 weeks.\n      Treatment continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. The dose of NX211 is escalated in cohorts of 3-6 patients until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and every\n      3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15\n      months."
