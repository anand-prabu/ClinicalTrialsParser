To further\n      determine the effect of COX-2 inhibition in primary breast cancer, we aimed at studying the\n      changes in breast cancer tissues of patients treated with the selective COX-2 inhibitor\n      celecoxib.\n\n      In a single-centre double-blinded phase II study, breast cancer patients were randomised to\n      receive either pre-operative celecoxib (400 mg) or placebo twice daily for two to three\n      weeks. We collected fresh-frozen pre-surgical biopsies (before treatment) and surgical\n      excision specimens (after treatment) to assess the tumor changes by use a cDNA microarray,\n      which allows to study the genome-wide changes at the transcriptional level."
