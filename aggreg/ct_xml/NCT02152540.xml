  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will study 40 Veterans identified with symptoms understood to characterize mild
      to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
      Following screening and informed consent, veterans will be randomly assigned to treatment
      with repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) or sham rTMS (placebo). Additional
      examinations will compare brain imaging (structural and functional MRI scans at rest) across
      participants at baseline, after acute rTMS treatment, and at 6 month followup. The VA
      population differs significantly from populations that have been included in prior trials of
      rTMS for many conditions such as depression, chronic pain, and PTSD. Many returning OEF/OIF
      personnel and Veterans with concussion histories report cognitive problems, such as impaired
      attention, verbal fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental flexibility.
      The investigators hope to show the efficacy and durability of rTMS in treating these
      symptoms safely in Veterans with co-morbidities.

    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and durability of benefits of
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a promising non-invasive therapeutic
      treatment for executive function deficits reported in Veterans with mild to moderate
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients. Although much progress has been made towards
      understanding the various deficits following TBI, progress has yet to be made towards
      identifying and assessing therapeutic treatment options that are responsive to TBI symptoms.
      Many returning OEF/OIF Veterans with concussion histories report cognitive symptoms that may
      last for months or years, and affect every day function. Symptoms faced by Veterans with
      mild to moderate TBI include executive function deficits such as impaired attention
      (including shifting sets), verbal fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental
      flexibility. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of rTMS in Veterans with mild
      to moderate TBI in improving executive functioning.

      A recent VA study reported improvements in PTSD and related symptoms in Veterans with PTSD
      who received rTMS (Watts et al., 2012). Repetitive TMS is a method of delivering
      therapeutic, non-invasive brain stimulation that is currently being used at the VA Palo Alto
      and Stanford University in a number of clinical trials.

      For this pilot study the investigators propose to enroll 40 Veterans diagnosed with mild to
      moderate TBI (age range 20-65). Inclusion Criteria: mild and moderate TBI will be defined
      as: post-traumatic amnesia (PTA &lt; 1 day for mild; 1 day&gt; x &lt; 7days for moderate). Because of
      the extensively documented co-occurrence of TBI with PTSD, (Veterans with TBI with and
      without PTSD will be enrolled). PTSD will be assessed using standard clinical measures.
      Exclusionary criteria: patients will be screened for TMS and MRI safety. The duration of the
      study will be two years, with a 1.5 year enrollment period, and a final half-year of
      follow-up completion. Following a preliminary telephone screen, Veterans will be scheduled
      for onsite informed consent, screening, and baseline assessments. Using an electronic
      randomization form, participants will be enrolled into two groups: active rTMS or sham rTMS.
      As this is a double blind placebo controlled study, only the subject ID number is provided
      to the nurse administrating the rTMS treatment. After randomization, the rTMS nurse will
      test the motor threshold (MT) for rTMS.  Each participant will be in the trial for a total
      of approximately (28) weeks: 1-2 weeks screening, (2) weeks acute treatment phase (including
      MRI pre and post rTMS) and 24 weeks (6 month) follow-up phase (with MRI, neuropsychological
      testing and self-report measures). Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) will be the
      stimulation site as it is shown to be affective in treatment of depression and approved by
      FDA. All participants will receive a minimum of 20 treatments before being evaluated for
      change in executive function (primary outcome measure).

      The primary hypothesis is that Veterans receiving active rTMS will show improvement more
      than sham treated Veterans in (performance between baseline and last assessment of &gt;1 SD on
      either the Trail Making Test part B, D-KEFS Verbal Fluency and/or D-KEFS Color-Word
      Interference Test). Additional analysis will include: Sustained Improvement on executive
      function composite score; secondary consequences of TBI scores on Quality of Life (QOL)
      scale, moderators of response such as age, severity of symptoms at baseline, type of
      comorbidity (e.g., PTSD); and, functional brain activity changes with rTMS treatment. This
      pilot study will be one of the first to demonstrate rTMS as a treatment for executive
      function deficit in Veterans with mild to moderate TBI. Additionally, it would also report
      on the efficacy of using fMRI as a biomarker to capture this improvement in executive
      function.
