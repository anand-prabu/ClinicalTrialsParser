Male or female patients living or deceased, aged 18 years or older at the time of\n             first ablation for thyroid cancer.\n\n          2. Diagnosed with a well-differentiated T4 tumour (defined as a primary tumour of any\n             size that extends beyond the thyroid capsule [this may be referred to as TNM\n             classification T4, N0-1, M0-1]). This excludes unusual histological types such as\n             oncocytic (Hurthle cell carcinoma), tall cell, sclerosing or cribriform thyroid\n             cancers.\n\n          3. Undergone a near-total or total thyroidectomy on or after 01 January 2000\n\n          4. Undergone first ablation of thyroid remnants with high activity 131I (\u226528 mCi or \u2265\n             1.036 GBq).\n\n          5. Undergone first 131I ablation for the T4 tumour using either Thyrogen (0.9 mg IM on 2\n             consecutive days) or THW stimulation. This excludes use of non-standard Thyrogen\n             regimens (i.e., had a regimen of Thyrogen other than the standard 0.9 mg IM on 2\n             consecutive days or received Thyrogen in combination with THW).\n\n          6. Historical records are available confirming ablation results by:\n\n               -  DxWBS using small activity (\u22652 mCi or 74 MBq) of iodine 131I (or 123I) performed\n                  at least 6 months after administration of the first ablation activity of 131I\n                  and/or\n\n               -  Stimulated Tg measured at least 6 months after administration of the first\n                  ablation activity of 131I.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Historical records from patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded\n        from this retrospective evaluation:\n\n          1. Received propylthiouracil, methimazole, vitamins or supplements containing kelp or\n             iodine (taking a multivitamin that does not contain iodine or kelp is acceptable),\n             medications that significantly affect iodine handling such as high dose\n             corticosteroids, high dose diuretics, or lithium in the 45 days before administration\n             of first ablative activity of 131I.\n\n          2. Received any iodine-containing contrast agents within 3 months prior to first\n             ablative activity of 131I administered.\n\n          3. Used amiodarone within the 2 years prior to first ablative activity of 131I\n             administered."
