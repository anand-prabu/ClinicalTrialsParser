The patients will be randomized after the\n      \"intention-to-treat\" principle, before the primary operation.\n\n      If there is no radiologic signs of contrast leakage ore other contraindications for early\n      closer as septic episodes ore missing bowl movements the early closure will be preformed.\n\n      Primary end point is the rate of either postoperative death or postoperative complications\n      occurring at 90 days after the rectal resection.\n\n      Major and minor postoperative complications (anastomotic leakage, post operative death,\n      anastomotic fistula, postoperative peritonitis, pneumonia etc) and stoma related\n      complications (prolapsus or peristomial eventration, erosive peristomal dermatitis,\n      dehydration with hydroelectrolytic disorders, occlusive syndrome) would be registered.\n\n      LARS score and EORTC QLQ-30 will be sent preoperatively and after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months\n      postoperatively."
