            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Even though exercise improves long-term weight loss maintenance and reduces the risks of\n      cardiovascular disease and Type II  diabetes mellitus, obese adults are prone to drop out of\n      exercise programs.  Dr. Jakicic's prior findings suggest that exercise adherence can be\n      enhanced and short-term weight loss can be improved by making exercise more convenient via\n      prescribing exercise in multiple short bouts, rather than one  bout per day.  Effects on\n      long-term exercise adherence and weight loss have not been examined, however.  His findings\n      also suggest that providing more exercise options by placing exercise equipment in the home\n      may also increase adherence, as evidenced by a significant correlation between the presence\n      of home exercise equipment and physical activity.  However, no experimental studies have\n      tested whether placing exercise equipment in the home actually increases exercise adherence\n      and weight loss.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The study tested the hypothesis that prescribing exercise in multiple short bouts would\n      improve long-term exercise adherence and long-term weight loss, and that the addition of\n      home  exercise equipment would further improve these outcomes.  A total of 148 overweight\n      women were recruited and randomized to one of three treatments:  1) long-bout exercise; 2)\n      short-bout exercise; 3) short- bout exercise + home exercise equipment.  All subjects\n      participated in an 18-month behavioral weight loss program, in which body weight was\n      assessed at  0, 6, 12, and 18 months and exercise adherence was assessed throughout the 18\n      months.  Cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular disease risk factors were measured at\n      0, 6, and 18 months."
