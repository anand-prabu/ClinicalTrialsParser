  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the administration of ATIII during the
      intra-operative period results in improved anticoagulation for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
      and an attenuation of the activation of the coagulation cascade, as represented by a
      decrease in fibrin degradation products. The investigators believe this benefit would extend
      into the post-operative period resulting in a decreased incidence of thrombosis generation,
      as represented by a decrease in fibrin degradation products in the ICU period.

    <description>If the Activated clotting time (ACT) is below the goal of 480 seconds the patient will first be given an additional dose of 200u/kg of heparin. If the patient's ACT remains below 480 seconds, they will be given 20ml/kg of FFP. The above dose of heparin and FFP will be repeated until an ACT of greater than 480 seconds is achieved.
If Preoperative ATIII functional assay level is less than 70% - patients would be enrolled and randomized to either Placebo (normal saline) or ATIII.  Intraoperatively- (correcting to 100%) according to the following formula:
Units required = ((100%- baseline ATIII level*%) X body weight)/1.4
expressed as a % normal level based on functional ATIII assay</description>
