The device is\n      intended for use by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting.\n\n      This multi-reader multi-case study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL\u00ae to\n      the predicate Tocodynamometer device (TOCO).\n\n      This study involved 25 women at a Gestational Age of 36 weeks or less and 5 women at a\n      Gestation Age of greater than 36 and not in labor at five clinical sites. Each study subject\n      was instrumented with two technologies for measuring uterine activity:\n\n        1. Standard tocodynamometer attached to the maternal abdomen,\n\n        2. SureCALL\u00ae with a set of abdominal surface electrodes for uterine electromyography\n           attached to the maternal abdomen\n\n      An assessment was obtained and quantified from masked, qualified clinical obstetrician\n      readers for the evaluation of the equivalence of both labor monitor devices by identifying\n      in isolation the individual uterine contraction signals and the peak of each contraction\n      signal as recorded by each labor monitor device."
