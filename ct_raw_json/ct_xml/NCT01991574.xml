  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ferric hydroxide adipate is a ferric iron supplement containing iron hydroxide and a dietary
      organic acid that was developed at MRC Human Nutrition Research. We aim to determine if the
      ingestion of ferric hydroxide adipate with food induces a reduction in urinary phosphate
      concentration, compared with the administration of placebo plus the same food on a different
      occasion. We hypothesise that ferric hydroxide adipate binds some phosphate ions in the
      gastrointestinal tract, which prevents part of the phosphate load in a meal from being
      absorbed. On another visit, calcium will be given with the same food, as a positive control,
      since this element is well known to restrict dietary phosphate absorption through the
      formation of insoluble calcium phosphates in the gut lumen. We will compare urinary
      phosphate concentrations after co-ingestion of the calcium salt and food versus urinary
      phosphate following ferric hydroxide adipate and the same food. Additionally, the calcium
      data will be compared with placebo data, since a significant reduction in urinary phosphate
      concentrations after calcium treatment will confirm the suitability of the study design.

      Finally, iron absorption from the ferric hydroxide adipate treatment will be determined by
      labelling this preparation with 58Fe and measuring day 14 erythrocyte 57Fe:58Fe.

      The study design is: Three-way cross-over volunteer absorption study. Volunteers will not be
      told which treatment they receive (placebo, ferric hydroxide adipate, or supplemental
      calcium). Researchers co-ordinating the study on a day to day basis will be aware of
      treatment allocation, but analysts will not be told which samples correspond to which
      treatments.
