All interpretation of data will be sent to\n      Boston Children's Hospital to be reviewed, which is the primary research center in this\n      study.  There are 5 hospitals participating in this study.  The population targeted are\n      children with  moderate heart failure and must be on Ace  inhibitors at the time of\n      enrollment.  Our outcome after placing them on Carvedilol is to change their ejection\n      fraction on echo.  The patients will be seen every 1-2 weeks, while we will titrate their\n      medication to a maintenance dose.  Secondary outcome is to increase quality of life,\n      exercise tolerance and decrease their symptom scores as noted on their questionnaires."
