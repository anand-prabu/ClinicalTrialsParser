            "textblock": "PCOS is a common endocrinopathy affecting 5-10% of women in their reproductive age\n      characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries. This syndrome\n      is a serious problem in IVF since there is a high risk of developing ovarian\n      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins. The\n      introduction of GnRH antagonist in IVF has reduced the incidence of severe OHSS, still\n      maintaining a good ovarian response and pregnancy rate. Recently, a long acting GnRH\n      antagonist, Degarelix, was introduced for prostatic cancer treatment. Furthermore a recent\n      paper reported its use also for the induction of multiple follicular growth in a program of\n      oocyte donation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of GnRH antagonist\n      depot use in a protocol of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in PCOS women at risk of\n      developing OHSS in IVF cycles."
