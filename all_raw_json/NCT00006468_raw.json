Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective for metastatic\n      colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination\n      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer."

Patients are stratified\n      according to treatment center, performance status (0-1 vs 2), and number of metastatic sites\n      (1 vs more than 1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, and leucovorin calcium IV\n           over 2 hours followed by fluorouracil (5-FU) IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours followed\n           by 5-FU IV over 46 hours beginning on day 1 for courses 1-6 and 19-24. For courses\n           7-18, patients receive leucovorin calcium IV followed by 5-FU IV as above beginning on\n           day 1.\n\n      Courses repeat every 14 days in both arms in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 4 and 6, and every 6 courses\n      thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients (230 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 18 months."
