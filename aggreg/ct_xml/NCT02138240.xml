  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic disproportionately affects the 1.2 million U.S. households living in
      public housing, where nearly 50% of adults are obese and have a two-fold greater risk of
      hypertension. Using an ecologic framework, we propose that neighborhood social network
      factors likely promote unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to this disparity. The
      overall objective of this proposal is to identify social network factors that promote
      healthy diet, physical activity and healthy weight among public housing residents. We focus
      on the social network - the connections among people within a community - as theoretical
      work suggests that social networks have an important influence on health behaviors. However,
      no previous studies have examined lifestyle behaviors in a social network analysis or
      targeted these behaviors with a social network intervention. Our aim for this work is: 1) To
      develop a social network intervention to facilitate lifestyle behavior change and pilot test
      it in residents of public housing developments as in Baltimore, MD. We hypothesize that a
      social network intervention will be feasible and acceptable in promoting healthy lifestyle
      change, and that this intervention will alter lifestyle behaviors among public housing
      residents.
