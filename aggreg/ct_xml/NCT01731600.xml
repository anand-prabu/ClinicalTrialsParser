  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted globally. The aim of the trial is to investigate safety, efficacy
      and pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of NNC 0129-0000-1003
      (N8-GP) in children with severe haemophilia A who have undergone treatment with previous
      factor VIII (FVIII) products.
