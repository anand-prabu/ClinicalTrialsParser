            "textblock": "Dystonia, a disabling disease with uncontrolled movement disorders was considered to be a\n      manifestation of basal ganglia dysfunction, yet there is accumulating evidence from animal\n      and human experiments that the cerebellum plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of\n      dystonia. Our recent results suggest a deficient cerebellar sensory encoding in dystonia,\n      resulting in a decoupling of the motor component from the afferent information flow\n      resulting from changes in the environment. An overall loss of gabaergic-mediated inhibition\n      is at the forefront in dynamic changes in neural circuitry described in dystonia. In the\n      mature brain gabaergic control the generation of temporal synchronies and oscillations in\n      the glutamatergic neurons. Taken these all together with the results of a pilot experiment,\n      the investigators hypothesize that deficient synchronies in the fast gamma range are one of\n      the key mechanisms leading to abnormal communication inside the cerebello-cortical network\n      in dystonia. The investigators aim first to demonstrate it by means of MEG recordings\n      allowing to reconstruct the spatio-temporal dynamics of gamma oscillations in the nodes of\n      the cerebello-cortical network. The investigators then aim to re-establish (if lost) or\n      boost (if decreased) the defective synchronies by applying to the cerebellum at high gamma\n      frequency a non invasive transcranial alternative current stimulation."

During one session the shifts will be 10\u00b0, 30\u00b0, -20\u00b0, -40\u00b0 and in the other session -10\u00b0, -30\u00b0, 20\u00b0, 40\u00b0 in order to reduce possible skill transfer from the baseline session to the stimulation session. Indirect and direct trials will be randomized to avoid habituation and learning within a session. There will be 2 blocks of 160 trials.
