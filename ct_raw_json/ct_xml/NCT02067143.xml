  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in different centres and will study adult patients with
      Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The study
      treatment will include a induction/consolidation therapy incorporating pegylated
      Asparaginase (Peg-ASP) and lineage-targeted high-dose methotrexate plus other antileukemic
      drugs, for the achievement of an early negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status. The
      MRD study supports a risk/MRD-oriented final consolidation phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study in adult ALL is to improve , by risk category, the overall
      disease-free survival in relation to the achievement of an early MRD negative status and
      following induction/consolidation with Peg-ASP, lineage-targeted methotrexate infusions and
      other disease-specific therapeutic elements, with or without the application of allogeneic
      or autologous SCT depending on risk class and MRD study results. A survey of severe
      infections occurring along the entire chemotherapy and stem cell transplant program and
      until 2 years from the achievement of CR will be performed with the aim to increase the
      knowledge of these complications and to evaluate their impact on the antileukemic program
      and on the long term outcome of the underlying malignancy. The prospective survey of severe
      infections will be performed as an ancillary observational objective of the present study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent according to ICH/EU/GCP and national local laws.

          -  Age 18-65 years.

          -  A diagnosis of untreated Ph- ALL or LL is required, either de novo or secondary to
             chemo-radiotherapy for other cancer. Pretreatment with low-dose corticosteroids in
             patients presenting with hyperleukocytosis is allowed. All diagnostic procedures need
             to be performed on freshly obtained bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB)
             samples. The diagnosis must be one of: de novo ALL, secondary ALL, B-/T-cell LL Full
             cytological, cytochemical, cytogenetic and immunobiological disease characterization
             according to EGIL and WHO classifications. Bone marrow and peripheral blood sampling
             (ALL) or biopsy specimen (LL) are required for MRD study. Detailed indications on
             patient registration, storage of representative diagnostic material and diagnostic
             work-up, including the forwarding of samples for MRD study are given in Appendix B.

          -  Bone marrow and peripheral blood sampling (ALL) or biopsy specimen (LL) for MRD
             study.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2, unless a performance of 3 is unequivocally caused by the
             disease itself and not by preexisting comorbidity, and is considered and/or
             documented to be reversible following the application of antileukemic therapy and
             appropriate supportive measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Burkitt's leukemia or lymphoma.

          -  Down's syndrome

          -  Pre-existing, uncontrolled pathology such as heart failure (congestive/ischemic,
             acute myocardial infarction within the past 3 months, untreatable arrhythmias, NYHA
             classes III and IV), severe liver disease with serum bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL and/or ALT &gt;3
             x upper normal limit (unless attributable to ALL), kidney function impairment with
             serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL (unless attributable to ALL), and severe neuropsychiatric
             disorder that impairs the patient's ability to understand and sign the informed
             consent, or to cope with the intended treatment plan. N.B. For altered liver and
             kidney function tests, eligibility criteria can be reassessed at 24-96 hours,
             following the institution of adequate supportive measures.

          -  Pre-existing HIV positive serology (i.e. already known before enrolment). If HIV
             positivity is detected after enrolment, the patient is sent off study.

          -  A history of cancer that is not in a remission phase following surgery and/or
             radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, with life expectancy &lt;1 year.

          -  Pregnancy declared by the patient herself, unless a decision is taken with the
             patient to induce a therapeutic abortion in order to carry on with ALL therapy. A
             pregnancy test is performed at diagnosis but does not preclude the enrolment into
             study. Fertile patients will be advised to adopt contraceptive methods while on
             treatment.
