Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage\n      tumor cells. Irinotecan may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of irinotecan given together\n      with radiation therapy followed by irinotecan and carmustine and to see how well it works in\n      treating patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme."

Patients are stratified\n      according to receipt of concurrent enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIACs) (yes vs no).\n\n        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 3/5/2005): Patients receive carmustine IV over 2 hours\n           on day 1 of courses 2-5 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes (beginning immediately after\n           carmustine infusion) on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of courses 1-5. Patients also undergo\n           radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks concurrently with course 1 only. Treatment\n           repeats every 6 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the recommended dose for\n      phase II is determined. The recommended dose for phase II is defined as the dose at which no\n      more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II (patients receiving concurrent EIACs or non-EIACs open to accrual as of\n           3/5/2005): Patients receive irinotecan at the recommended dose, carmustine, and cranial\n           irradiation as in phase I.\n\n      Patients with disease progression are followed every 3 months for 5 years and then annually\n      for up to 10 years.\n\n      Patients taken off study for reasons other than disease progression are followed every 3\n      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-48 patients (6-24 per stratum) will be accrued for phase I\n      within 2-4 months (phase I closed to accrual as of 3/5/2005). A total of 93 patients will be\n      accrued for phase II (open to accrual for patients receiving concurrent enzyme-inducing\n      anticonvulsants [EIACs] or non-EIACs as of 3/5/2005)."
