            "textblock": "Background and Rationale:\n\n      Metformin has demonstrable efficacy in slowing or reversing the progression of various\n      insulin-resistant disease states - most notably type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. In seeking\n      to establish proof-of-concept that insulin resistance is a suitable pathophysiological\n      target in the treatment of PAD-related intermittent claudication (pain in the leg muscles\n      during walking, which resolves on exercise cessation), this study will determine whether the\n      known insulin-sensitizing effects of metformin translate to alleviation of the functional\n      limitations imposed by claudication.\n\n      Since type 2 diabetic individuals with PAD often rely on metformin as part of standard risk\n      factor management (glycemic control), the current study will enrol only those with\n      pre-diabetes or non-pharmacologically treated, well-controlled type 2 diabetes. In view of\n      the prevalence of disorders of glucose metabolism in PAD (approximately two-thirds of\n      unselected individuals), this mechanistic study should have far-reaching clinical\n      implications.\n\n      Study Design:\n\n      A total of 80 individuals with PAD-related intermittent claudication and abnormal glucose\n      metabolism will be randomised (1:1) to either metformin  or matching placebo for 16-18 weeks\n      (double-blind, parallel group design). The maximum daily dose of metformin will be 2000mg\n      (up-titrated from half this dose at 2 weeks if tolerated).\n\n      Primary Hypothesis:\n\n      Improvement in functional capacity follows metformin therapy in individuals with PAD-related\n      intermittent claudication and abnormal glucose metabolism. Change in functional capacity\n      will be assessed by the co-primary endpoints of pain-free and maximum walking times during a\n      standard graded treadmill exercise test.\n\n      Secondary Aims:\n\n      Exercise testing for functional performance will be complemented by assessments of perceived\n      physical functioning / quality of life in the daily life setting (using standard\n      questionnaires). As previous studies have indicated cardiovascular effects of metformin\n      incremental to blood glucose-lowering, this study will also investigate potential mechanisms\n      of efficacy relating to the primary endpoints, including changes in endothelial function,\n      blood flow responses to various stimuli (including insulin and acute exercise), insulin\n      sensitivity, and physical activity / sedentary behaviours. Changes in relevant clinical data\n      (including ankle-brachial index and limb hemodynamics by duplex scanning) will also be\n      determined.\n\n      Outcomes and Significance:\n\n      The unmet clinical need of efficacious medical therapies for intermittent claudication is a\n      growing problem given the increasing prevalence of PAD worldwide. If positive, this study\n      will identify a new potential treatment that is already widely available. The study will\n      also inform on novel mechanistic targets with relevance to existing and future therapeutic\n      strategies."
