  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is primarily designed to evaluate the IgG immune responses to the 13 pneumococcal
      serotypes induced by 13vPnC compared with the immune responses induced by 7vPnC when
      measured 1 month after the infant series, and to evaluate the acceptability of the safety
      profile of 13vPnC as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events and
      adverse events.
