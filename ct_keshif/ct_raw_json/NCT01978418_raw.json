This process is mediated through the activation of airway epithelial\n      sodium channels (ENaC). In animals, ENaC is considered crucial for postnatal pulmonary\n      adaptation. In humans, postnatal ENaC expression is dependent on gestational age and its\n      activity, measured as nasal potential difference, correlates with lung compliance.\n      Therefore, in the human newborn infant ENaC may be  important for physiologic postnatal\n      adaptation. The activity of ENaC is increased by beta-agonists, such as salbutamol. We\n      hypothesize that low pulmonary expression or activity of ENaC in the perinatal period causes\n      delayed clearance of lung fluid and thereby contributes to the risk for development of\n      transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) in term infants born by Caesarean section (CS)."
