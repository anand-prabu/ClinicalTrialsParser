          5. HIV-1 infection confirmed with positive ELISA or Western blot at Screening

          6. The subject's medical records must be sufficient to be categorized on IFN eligibility
             or prior treatment history with PEG/RBV.

          7. Confirmation of chronic HCV infection

               -  On a stable, protocol-approved, ARV for &gt;8 weeks prior to Screening with a CD4
                  T-cell count &gt;200 cells/mm3 and a documented undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA level
                  for ≥ 8 weeks preceding the Screening visit

             (NS)5B polymerase

          5. Chronic liver disease of a non-HCV etiology (e.g., hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease,
             α1 antitrypsin deficiency, cholangitis)

          6. A new AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within 30 days prior to screening

          7. Active, serious infection (other than HIV or HCV) requiring parenteral antibiotics,
             antivirals or antifungals within 30 days prior to Baseline

          8. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV)

          9. Contraindication to RBV therapy

         10. Chronic use of systemically administered immunosuppressive agents (e.g., prednisone
             equivalent &gt; 10 mg/day)

         11. History of solid organ transplantation or malignancy diagnosed or treated within 5
             years

         12. Current or prior history of clinical hepatic decompensation or other significant
             gastrointestinal disorder
