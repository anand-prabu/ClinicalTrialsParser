To develop these studies, researchers want\n      to collect samples from people with cancer or precancer conditions of the lymph system.\n      These conditions include multiple myeloma, different types of lymphoma, and adult\n      leukemia/lymphoma. The samples collected will include blood, urine, bone marrow, and tumor\n      and skin tissue.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To collect tissue samples to study different types of lymph cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a lymphoid cancer or precancer condition.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.\n\n        -  Different samples will be collected for study. Blood samples will be collected at the\n           initial testing. More blood samples will be collected at different treatment points.\n           Other liquid samples include urine, bone marrow, and any abnormal fluid. Tumor tissue\n           and skin tissue biopsies will also be collected for study.\n\n        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study."

Laboratory investigations conducted in the\n      Metabolism Branch, including analysis of cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic biology\n      are attempting to develop new prognostic and diagnostic models, therapeutic agents and novel\n      treatment approaches for lymphoid malignancies and premalignant conditions.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      This biology protocol is designed to allow sample acquisition for use in the study of\n      lymphoid malignancies and malignancy precursors, including but not limited to B and T cell\n      malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin   s lymphoma (HL),\n      multiple myeloma (MM), lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma\n      (ATL). A variety of laboratory investigations will be conducted on blood, tumor, bone\n      marrow, urine, abnormal fluid and normal tissue, including analysis of cellular, molecular,\n      genetic and genomic biology in the support of NIH translational trials to develop new\n      therapeutic agents and novel treatment approaches as well as new prognostic and diagnostic\n      models.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Adult patients with confirmed pathological diagnosis of lymphoid malignancy or lymphoid\n      precursor, including B-cell and T-cell lymphomas: including but not limited to diffuse large\n      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin   s lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), lymphomatoid\n      granulomatosis (LYG) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL).\n\n      Design:\n\n      The purpose of this study is to examine, in an exploratory fashion, a variety of biologic\n      assays relevant to the investigation of lymphoid malignancies.\n\n      It is anticipated that up to 60 consented subjects, 50 at the NCI site, 10 at the UWI site,\n      will be studied each year. Thus, an accrual ceiling of 600 consented subjects is planned\n      over 10 years."
