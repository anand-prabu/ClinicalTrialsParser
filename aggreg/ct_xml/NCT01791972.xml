  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose (2
      inhalations, 180 mcg total) of Albuterol SPIROMAX (90 mcg per inhalation) versus placebo in
      patients with EIB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-treatment,
      2-sequence, 2-way crossover, multicenter study in patients with a documented history of EIB,
      with or without underlying asthma. Each patient will participate in the study for
      approximately 5 weeks. Each patient will complete 2 screening visits (SV1 and SV2), 2
      treatment visits (TV1 and TV2), and a follow-up telephone call (FV).

             informed consent signed and dated by the patient before conducting any study related
             procedures and review of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
             (HIPAA) authorization; for patients 12 to 17 years of age, inclusive, written
             informed consent signed and dated by the parent/legal guardian and written assent

          -  If female, is currently not pregnant, breastfeeding, or attempting to become
             pregnant, has a negative serum pregnancy test, and is of non-childbearing potential.

          -  Documented history of EIB, with or without underlying asthma. The underlying asthma
             must be well-controlled (in the investigator's judgment) as per the National Asthma

          -  Other criteria apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Requires a rescue bronchodilator following the exercise challenge at SV1 for a
             decrease in FEV1 that does not return to within 20% of their pre-exercise challenge
             FEV1 within 30 minutes after administration of the rescue medication.

          -  Pregnant, nursing, or plans to become pregnant or donate gametes (ova or sperm) for
             in vitro fertilization during the study period or for 30 days after the patient's
             last study related visit (for eligible patients only-if applicable).

          -  Participation in any investigational drug trial within the 30 days preceding SV1 or
             planned participation in another investigational drug trial at any time during this
             trial.

          -  A known hypersensitivity to albuterol or any of the excipients in the formulation.

          -  History of severe milk protein allergy.

          -  History of a respiratory infection or disorder (including, but not limited to
             bronchitis, pneumonia, otitis media, acute or chronic sinusitis, influenza, etc) that
             has not resolved within the 2 weeks preceding SV1.

          -  Other criteria apply.
