Re-screening, study drug dose interruption is not\n      allowed. The duration of study drug dose interruption is defined as for 1 week.\n\n      Treatment with TARGIN  will be started at 10/5mg twice daily for 4 weeks, and proper\n      titration (up-titration) will be allowed at each visit according to the investigator's\n      decision. Dose titration up to a maximum of TARGIN 40/20mg twice daily will be permitted\n      during study period.\n\n      The up-titration will be considered by investigator's judgement as followings; (1) if the\n      rescue medication was used more than 2 times per day, on average or (2) based on the daily\n      average NRS, if the NRS was changed to worsen since the previous visit, (3) Investigator's\n      judgement by considering any titration needed situation (e.g. dose, frequency of rescue\n      medication).\n\n      Safety laboratories will be obtained at baseline (visit 1) and study end (visit 4) in a\n      local laboratory. The laboratory values within 4 weeks prior to baseline (visit 1) will be\n      allowed to use at study visit 1.\n\n      The rescue medication is the 5mg of IRcodonTM.\n\n      Patients will be withdrawn from the study if the following circumstance require study drug\n      discontinuation:\n\n      Failure of pain control (Failure of pain control will be decided by investigators judgement,\n      e.g. there is poor pain control or lack of efficacy despite 2~3 times of up titration.)\n      Adjustment of the other analgesics due to AE except TARGIN or IRcodonTM Adjustment of the\n      other major pain management modality (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, non-surgical\n      interventional therapy, etc.) Withdrawal of informed consent Pregnancy Any other significant\n      risk to the patient's safety in the clinical judgement of the investigator"
