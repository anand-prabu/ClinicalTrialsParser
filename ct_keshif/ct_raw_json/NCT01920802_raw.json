The\n      primary outcome measure will be a correlation of early changes in leptin with weight gain.\n      We will also record changes in food intake, resting metabolic rate, oral glucose tolerance\n      and fasting insulin and glucose levels, lipids and inflammation markers. Subjects will be\n      followed closely to monitor for safety throughout the 4-week study and will be discontinued\n      if there is a medically significant change in metabolic status or other antipsychotic side\n      effects. Metabolic assessments will be performed again at the time of discontinuation or at\n      the end of an 4-week period, and change from baseline in the two treatment groups will be\n      compared."

Early changes (baseline vs day 3) in leptin will correlate with later changes in weight\n           (at study termination.)\n\n             1. Olanzapine will cause the greatest increase in calorie consumption     from\n                baseline on the multi-item meal compared with iloperidone or placebo.\n\n             2. Olanzapine subjects will report the greatest frequency/quantity of eating in food\n                diaries, and report increased preference for calorically dense foods (ie, higher\n                fat content) compared to iloperidone or placebo.\n\n             3. Early markers of endocrine changes caused by olanzapine will be greater than those\n                caused by iloperidone or placebo, and these early changes will correlate with\n                weight gain.\n\n        2. Olanzapine will have greater effects on glucose homeostasis than iloperidone or\n           placebo, and these effects will be separate from effects on body weight and\n           composition.\n\n             1. Early signs of metabolic disturbance, including glucose intolerance (greater\n                excursion on OGTT) and insulin resistance (higher plasma insulin) will precede any\n                significant weight gain.\n\n             2. Early evidence of glucose intolerance and/or insulin resistance will predict\n                greater metabolic derangements with further dosing of olanzapine, as evidenced by\n                exacerbated glucose intolerance on OGTT or higher plasma glucose/insulin levels.\n                These effects may not necessarily parallel weight gain.\n\n             3. Olanzapine will be associated with greater markers of inflammation than\n                iloperidone or placebo."
