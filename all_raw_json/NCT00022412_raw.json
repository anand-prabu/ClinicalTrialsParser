Patients are randomized to one\n      of 2 arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxercalciferol once daily for 28 days. Patients then undergo\n           prostatectomy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation for 28 days. Patients then undergo prostatectomy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      18 months."
