  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when the part of the aorta travelling down into the
      abdomen balloons out more than 50%. If caught early, treatments can be used to prevent
      rupture of the aneurysm. However, many of these aneurysms are asymptomatic and go undetected
      until they rupture, causing large amounts of blood to spill into the abdominal cavity and
      typically leads to death, if left untreated. The current mortality rate is between 50 and
      90%. The resources required to treat patients with ruptured aortic aneurysms is quite
      substantial given that they need blood transfusions and can have prolonged hospital stays.
      Patients either undergo a more invasive operative repair, associated with greater blood
      products transfusions and complications, or if relatively stable, undergo a less invasive
      repair with tubes called stents. There is less morbidity associated with the latter,
      endovascular repair. To prevent blood loss in elective surgeries, drugs that promote blood
      clotting are often used. One drug, tranexamic acid , has been shown to reduce blood loss,
      reduce the number of blood transfusions required and improve patient outcomes in elective
      cardiac and orthopaedic surgeries, and more recently, in patients with traumatic hemorrhage.
       However, this drug has not been tested in this particular population. The purpose of this
      pilot project is to evaluate the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in reducing clinically
      significant bleeding in patients with ruptured aortic aneurysms in hospital sites across
      Saskatchewan using a single-group intervention design. The investigators will compare the
      data from patients treated with tranexamic acid to retrospective data from a control group
      that is matched on key variables. The investigators predict that tranexamic acid will result
      in reduced bleeding, reduced need for blood transfusions, less patients that require open
      surgery and improved patient outcomes. The results of this study will help determine if this
      treatment is effective at preventing the death of many people with ruptured abdominal aortic
      aneurysms.
