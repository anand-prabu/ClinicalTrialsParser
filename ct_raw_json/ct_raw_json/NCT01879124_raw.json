            "textblock": "Since March 2004, and as part of routine clinical practice, protocol renal allograft\n      biopsies are routinely performed at implantation and at 3, 12 and 24 months after\n      transplantation, in all patients who receive a kidney transplant at the University Hospitals\n      Leuven, unless there is a medical contra-indication or patient refusal to undergo this\n      procedure. The biopsies are scheduled using a dedicated Microsoft Access database (\"Biopsy\n      Database\"), that is maintained on the central servers of the University Hospitals Leuven.\n      Patients who have an unexplained change in renal allograft function, undergo additional\n      clinically indicated indication biopsies. These biopsies are also recorded in the\n      aforementioned Microsoft Access Database.\n\n      All clinical data, including pretransplant donor and recipient characteristics, and\n      post-transplant follow-up data are directly stored and maintained in a prospectively\n      collected electronic database (CCL database until 06/2012, transferred to the central KWS\n      database in 2012). This electronic database is the only existing clinical database for these\n      patients, and contains all clinical patient charts. No written records are collected.\n\n      All renal allograft biopsies will be rescored by a single renal pathologist according to the\n      most recent Banff classification, blinded for the clinical parameters and timing of the\n      biopsy. These rescoring data are directly entered in the dedicated Microsoft Access database\n      (\"Biopsy Database\").\n\n      Just prior to performing a renal allograft biopsy with ultrasound guidance, and as part of\n      the routine clinical procedure, duplex measurements are performed by the radiologist who\n      will perform the biopsy. The peak systolic velocity (Vmax) and the minimal diastolic\n      velocity (Vmin) are determined in each patient in two to three representative interlobar\n      arteries. The resistive index is calculated as [1 - (V min/V max)]. This procedure is\n      repeated at three different places in the kidney (lower, interpolar and upper pole). These\n      data are directly entered in the central electronic clinical database system (KWS, see\n      above).\n\n      All electronic data will be transferred to a SAS database at time of data extraction."
