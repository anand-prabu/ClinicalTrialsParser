Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or\n      -2b and ribavirin have been used in small numbers of hepatitis C virus-infected children\n      with sustained virological response being higher in genotypes 2 and 3 than in genotypes 1\n      and 4. Genotype 4 is has been described as difficult-to-treat genotype. Several attempts to\n      modify treatment protocols have been tried in adults in an attempt to achieve higher rates\n      of sustained virological response.  Shortening injection interval and/or treatment duration\n      prolongation have been tried with variable outcome reports.\n\n      A novel Hansenula- derived pegylated interferon alpha 2a: 20 Kilo dalton (Reiferon Retard)\n      has been used over the last 4 years in the Egyptian market.\n\n      We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Reiferon retard  plus ribavirin\n      customized regimen in hepatitis C virus-RNA seropositive Egyptian children. Forty six\n      children with chronic hepatitis C virus aged 3-19 years were selected from 3 hepatic\n      tertiary centers.\n\n      Clinical and laboratory evaluation were undertaken. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction\n      (PCR) for HCV-RNA was done before starting treatment, at 4, 12, 24, 48, 72 weeks during\n      treatment and 6 months after stoppage of treatment. All patients were assigned to receive a\n      weekly subcutaneous injection of pegylated interferon alpha 2-a ( Reiferon Retard) plus oral\n      Ribavirin daily for 12 weeks ,then cases were divided according to PCR results into 2\n      groups.\n\n      Group I:  Patients who continued treatment on weekly basis: this group included patients who\n      had negative PCR at week 12 as well those who had positive PCR without any change in\n      viremia. Group II: Patients who continued treatment on a 5- days schedule: this group\n      included patients who had any decrease in viremia at week 12.\n\n      Patients who were PCR-negative at week 48 and had at least one PCR-positive test during\n      therapy were assigned to have an extended treatment course of 6 months duration.\n\n      The occurrence of adverse effects was assessed during treatment and follow up"

In Egypt, the prevalent genotype is the difficult-to-treat genotype 4. Attempts\n      are being made to improve the treatment outcomes. In the current study we aim to investigate\n      the effect of customized pegylated interferon-alpha-2a  plus ribavirin in children with\n      chronic hepatitis C virus. For that, 46 children with chronic hepatitis C virus were\n      recruited from three tertiary Pediatric Hepatology centers. All were assigned to receive\n      weekly subcutaneous pegylated interferon-alpha-2a plus daily ribavirin for 12 weeks. At this\n      point, the study population was divided into two arms. Arm 1 included those who became\n      hepatitis C virus-RNA negative by polymerase chain reaction and those who showed no change\n      of viremia or a decrease of less than 1 log. This group continued treatment on weekly bases\n      for 48 weeks, even those who are hepatitis C virus-RNA positive. Arm 2; included patients\n      who had a decrease in viremia more than one log of pre-treatment viremia level. For those\n      patients, injection interval was shortened to every 5-day for a completion period of 48\n      weeks. Patients from either group who were polymerase chain reaction-negative at week 48,\n      but had at least one polymerase chain reaction-positive test during therapy, were assigned\n      to have an extended treatment course up to 72 weeks.\n\n      So the first customization was,\n\n        1. prolongation of treatment duration for up to 48 weeks regardless response type\n\n        2. Shortening injection interval in some patients to every 5-day injection\n\n        3. The third customization was the prolongation of treatment for extra 6 months, i.e. up\n           tp 72 weeks in some patients.\n\n      The occurrence of adverse effects, virological and biochemical responses were assessed\n      during treatment and follow up."
