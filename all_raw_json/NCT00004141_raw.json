Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune\n      system and stop cancer cell from growing. Combining more than one drug with different types\n      of biological therapies may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      biological therapy in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma."

Treatment\n      repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression, and then every 8-12 weeks\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
