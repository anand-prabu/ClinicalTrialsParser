Correlate intra-operative optical imaging (IOOI) findings with pre-operative magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI) findings and clinical staging.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody MDX1201-A488 intravenously (IV) over 30\n      minutes on day 1 and undergo IOOI during RALP on day 5.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year."
