In December 2012, the FDA approved Zytiga \u00ae in combination with prednisone\n      to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have not received\n      prior chemotherapy. Degarelix (Firmagon \u00ae), a testosterone lowering agent given as a monthly\n      injection, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The\n      purpose of this study is to evaluate abiraterone acetate and prednisone in combination with\n      degarelix as a possible treatment for PSA recurrent prostate cancer as compared to\n      abiraterone acetate alone and degarelix alone. This will be the first time these drugs will\n      be used together."
