Investigators\n      have developed a computerized training program that aims to improve RI. Fifty children with\n      TTM will be randomly assigned to (a) online 8-session RI training (n=25), or (b) 1-month\n      waitlist condition (n = 25), and will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month\n      follow-up. Investigators hypothesize that the online RIT will show greater improvement in\n      TTM symptoms and RI capabilities at post-treatment and 1-month follow-up assessments,\n      compared to the waitlist condition. This study will help develop an effective cognitive\n      intervention program for TTM."

            "textblock": "Although trichotillomania (TTM), an impulse control disorder characterized by compulsive\n      hair pulling, typically results in serious consequences including impaired individual\n      functioning, medical problems (e.g., skin infections), and elevated comorbidity with other\n      psychiatric disorders, it remains one of the most poorly-understood and inadequately-treated\n      psychiatric conditions. There is an urgent need for effective and accessible clinical\n      interventions for TTM, especially for young individuals who suffer from a marked lack of\n      adequate treatment resources despite the early onset of the condition. One promising\n      therapeutic approach is to improve cognitive problems believed to contribute to TTM, using a\n      computerized cognitive retraining method. Research has indicated impaired response\n      inhibition (RI; the ability to inhibit inappropriate but potent response) as an important\n      cognitive feature underlying TTM. Therefore, RI is considered to be an important target of\n      cognitive retraining. Investigators have developed a computerized training program that aims\n      to improve RI capabilities in the format of an online video game. Fifty children with TTM\n      will be randomly assigned to (a) online 8-session RIT (n=25), or (b) 1-month waitlist\n      condition (n = 25), and will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up.\n      The waitlisted participants will also be invited to undergo the training program after the\n      1-month follow-up assessment is completed. Investigators hypothesize that the online RIT\n      will show greater improvement in TTM symptoms and RI capabilities at post-treatment and\n      1-month follow-up assessments, compared to the waitlist condition. This study is expected to\n      generate important data that will guide the development of an accessible, cost-efficient,\n      and effective cognitive intervention for individuals suffering from TTM."
