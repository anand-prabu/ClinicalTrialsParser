Proper stretching and exercise of the joints and affected arm from the\n      time of diagnosis can greatly assist in the development of healthy movement of the limb.\n      Additionally, neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been shown to be an effective\n      treatment in other neural disorders and therefore its effectiveness in NBPP is worth\n      studying.\n\n      In the case of NBPP patients, the loss in normal arm function can be observed very early.\n      Young patients will often neglect using the affected arm or modify motions to avoid the use\n      of the biceps muscle, specifically in hand to mouth actions such as gripping a bottle or\n      placing toys or other objects in the mouth. A goal of this study is to test the\n      effectiveness of NMES on the biceps muscle in improving the participant's ability to perform\n      normal hand to mouth actions. Additionally, biceps muscle Medical Research Council (MRC)\n      strength and active range of motion (AROM) will be tested to examine the increase of useful\n      arm movement.\n\n      The subjects of this study are newborns between the ages of 3-6 months who are already a\n      part of the University of Michigan Brachial Plexus program. Parents of the children will be\n      trained to perform the neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy at home using the EMPI\n      Continuum unit for 30 minutes each day and monthly follow up appointments will be performed\n      be the research occupational therapists throughout three month study period.\n\n      Parents of the participants will complete a questionnaire before and during the study period\n      to help analyze for confounders and gather data regarding parent compliance and NMES\n      effectiveness. To detect the effectiveness of NMES, two cohort groups using standard units\n      and sham units will be recruited and compare with data analysis.\n\n      The investigators predict that the NMES will effectively improve the ability of the neonate\n      to increase use of the affected arm, specifically in hand to mouth movements and other\n      aspects of biceps MRC score and AROM."
