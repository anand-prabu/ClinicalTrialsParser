  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural lidocaine is widely used in anesthesia for urologic or lower abdominal surgery
      because of its rapid onset. But the epidural anesthesia using high concentration of
      lidocaine may cause excessive motor block and unwanted side effects such as nausea, vomiting
      and hypotension.

      This is a study to determine the effective concentration of lidocaine with fentanyl in
      lumbar epidural anesthesia for transurethral resection of prostate in elderly patients.

    <time_frame>A blinded Assistant assess sensory and motor blockade in a 2-min intervals up to 60 minutes.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The occurrence of sensory block up to at T 12 and motor function score of 3 or more on the modified Bromage scale were considered characteristics of a successful block. Moreover, the surgery should be concluded without any complementary analgesia to confirm the success of the anesthetic procedure.</description>

    <description>The study method was a step-up/step-down sequence model where the dose for following patients was determined by the outcome of the preceding block. The starting concentration of lidocaine was 1.5 % mixed with fentanyl 75 ug. All patients receive 13mL of lidocaine with fentanyl 75ug. The concentration of lidocaine for subsequent patients is determined by the outcome in the previous patient according to up and down sequential allocation in 0.1% increments.  In the case of block failure, the concentration of lidocaine was increased by 0.1%.
Conversely, block success resulted in a reduction in concentration by 0.1%.</description>
