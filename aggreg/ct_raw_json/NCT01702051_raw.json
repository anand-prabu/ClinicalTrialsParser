Total\n      pancreatectomy with IAT is being used almost exclusively for treatment of chronic\n      pancreatitis. More recently, indications other than chronic pancreatitis have been reported\n      including IAT after extended pancreatectomy performed for the resection of benign tumors of\n      the mid-segment of the pancreas or IAT after total pancreatectomy for severe abdominal\n      trauma In this study, we study our experience with IAT for the treatment of a broader\n      population of patients undergoing pancreatic surgery including subjects with technically\n      unfeasible or high risk pancreatic anastomosis during partial pancreatectomy and subjects\n      undergoing completion pancreatectomy because of anastomosis leakage after\n      pancreatoduodenectomy for nonmalignant or malignant diseases."
