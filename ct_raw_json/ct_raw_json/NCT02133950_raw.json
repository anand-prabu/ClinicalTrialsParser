The secondary aim is to assess the logistic advantage of segmentation in\n      PGD cycles.\n\n      Experimental questions\n\n        1. Is the cumulative live birth rate rate of a single PGD treatment when all genetically\n           transferable embryos are cryopreserved by vitrification prior to consecutive in utero\n           transfer in unstimulated cycles, superior to PGD treatment with fresh embryo transfer\n           cumulative with transfer of supernumerary cryopreserved embryos?\n\n        2. Does the technique of segmentation allow better planning of DNA amplification and\n           genetic analysis?\n\n      Design The proposed design is a pragmatic, prospective randomised controlled trial"
