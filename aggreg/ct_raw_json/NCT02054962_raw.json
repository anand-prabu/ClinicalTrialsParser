            "textblock": "Chronic problems after traumatic events are common in non-elderly adults.  Previous studies\n      have shown that after minor motor vehicle collision (MVC), 10-30% of non-elderly adult\n      patients develop chronic regional pain (neck or back pain). In addition, up to 1/3 of\n      non-elderly adults will develop psychological sequelae, including posttraumatic stress\n      disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders.  There have been no prospective studies\n      examining the frequency or predictors of persistent pain or psychological sequelae in older\n      adults. The proposed study seeks to determine the frequency of persistent pain,\n      psychological sequelae, and associated disability in older adults after minor MVC trauma and\n      to identify candidate predictors for a model of adverse outcomes after MVC in this\n      population. 200 individuals over 65 years of age will be recruited from emergency\n      departments in four states with no-fault accident laws. Patients who meet inclusion criteria\n      and who consent to the ED study will undergo a 30-45 minute ED assessment of crash-related,\n      psychosocial, and biological factors, and complete telephone follow-ups at 2 weeks, 6 weeks\n      6 months, and 12 months.  The wealth of information gained from this study will be used to\n      determine the frequency of adverse events in older adults after MVC and to identify high\n      risk elderly patients. These results will inform subsequent development of secondary\n      pharmacologic and/or behavioral interventions to prevent chronic pain and psychological\n      sequelae after traumatic events in older adults."
