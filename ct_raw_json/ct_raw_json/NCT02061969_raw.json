Patients with\n      poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c >7.5%) will be randomized to a 6-month intervention with\n      linagliptin or glargine insulin (\u00b1 metformin for both treatments). Our hypothesis is that\n      treatment with linagliptin, a once daily DPP4-inhibitor, will result in similar improvement\n      in glucose control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than insulin treatment in LTC\n      residents with T2D. We will also determine differences in clinical outcome, resource\n      utilization, and hospitalization costs between LTC residents with T2D treated with\n      linagliptin and basal and correction insulin. We will compare differences in complications\n      (infectious and non-infectious, neurological and cardiovascular events), emergency room\n      visits and hospitalizations between groups during the 6 months of intervention."
