It this review, it is mentioned that the validity of the simulator\n      (realism) is essential to help learners to increase their skills and sharpen their\n      responses. It is essential to get and maintain engagement during high-fidelity simulation\n      and it pass by an increase in realism and situation awareness. The purpose of this study is\n      to evaluate if the use of identification badge (physical and conceptual realism) during\n      high-fidelity simulation as an impact on situation awareness and engagement."
