The study\n      design will allow us to address our hypothesis that low frequency deep brain stimulation\n      parameters are more effective than the conventional settings at improving sleep architecture\n      and wake-time vigilance. If our hypothesis is correct, low frequency settings could be used\n      during sleep and this would prolong stimulator battery life, therefore decreasing the\n      frequency of required surgical battery changes for DBS.  These data will be valuable in\n      considering clinical treatment strategies and provide insight into the basic mechanisms of\n      sleep dysfunction in PD.  The study may also contribute to understanding how to achieve\n      maximum clinical benefit from DBS while minimizing morbidity and cost."
