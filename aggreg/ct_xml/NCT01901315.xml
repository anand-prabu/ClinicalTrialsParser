      Introduction: Within the emergence of the Internet and for the purposes of providing
      psychiatric services across distances, the provision of mental health service via video
      counseling has become a possible way of mental health service delivery. An appropriate
      systematization of the propaedeutic methods in psychiatry, according to the interactive
      resources of telemedicine, and a standardized assessment based on clinical records turn this
      method to a viable alternative for service delivery all over the world. The main benefit of
      video counseling is an increased access to care services. But, so far, there is still
      limited research regarding to the effectiveness of telepsychiatry in the management of
      mental illnesses.

      Objective: To verify the applicability of psychiatric attendance via Interned-based
      videoconferencing, comparing various quality characteristics between this method and
      face-to-face attendance, on the basis of a one-year follow-up study with a randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) design.

      Material and methods: 100 patients of the Institute of Psychiatry (IPq) between 18 to 55
      years old with depressive disorders are randomly allocated to a control (monthly
      face-to-face consultation with the attending psychiatrist) or intervention group. The
      intervention group will have consultations with the attending psychiatrist through
      internet-based videoconference. For reasons of patient safety, consultations at baseline,
      and after 6 and 12 months will be realized in a face-to-face form for all patients. At
      baseline, and after 6 and 12 months mental health, satisfaction with treatment, therapeutic
      relationship, and medical compliance will be assessed. Depression will be assessed at
      baseline, and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
