The investigators propose to\n      prospectively evaluate blood glucose testing done every day compared to every other day. The\n      primary goal is to establish the most cost-effective modality while still being able to\n      detect patients who require therapy in a timely fashion. The investigators plan to evaluate\n      this new management scheme utilizing a non-inferiority trial design.\n\n      The investigators primary research question is the following: When managing patients with\n      GDM, is every other day blood glucose testing non-inferior compared to every day blood\n      glucose testing, as measured by the difference of less than 5% in birth weight?"

Patients with GDM diagnosed between 20\n      weeks 0 days and 32 weeks 0 days of gestation will be recruited. Diagnosis of GDM will be\n      based on Carpenter and Coustan criteria for an abnormal 3-hr 100 gram oral glucose tolerance\n      test, as currently supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n      (ACOG). Patients whose 1-hr, 50 gram oral glucose challenge test exceeds 200 mg/dl will not\n      require a 3-hr OGTT.  If the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed\n      below, she will be offered participation in the trial and randomized to every day blood\n      glucose testing or every other day blood glucose testing for the remainder of her pregnancy.\n\n      After the diagnosis of GDM, and before recruitment to the study, all patients will be\n      provided counseling and education and will attempt adequate blood glucose control with\n      medical nutritional therapy alone for one week. During this period, all patients will test\n      their blood glucose values daily. Only after this week is completed will a subject be\n      approached for participation."
