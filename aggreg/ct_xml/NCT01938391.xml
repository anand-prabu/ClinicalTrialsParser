      IVUS imaging will be utilized to assess performance of the Sponsor's Orbital Atherectomy
      System (OAS) followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty (BA) in patients who have
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) occurring in the Superficial Femoral Artery
      (SFA), Popliteal (POP),and/or Tibioperoneal Trunk (TPT).

      This study is a prospective, single-arm (non-randomized), post-market study which will
      enroll up to 25 subjects.  IVUS imaging and angiography will be used to assess procedural
      outcomes in patients who have symptomatic peripheral artery disease who are treated with the
      Sponsor's OAS and adjunctive balloon angioplasty.  An independent IVUS Core Lab will be used
      to provide adjudicated analyses for IVUS outcomes.  In clinic follow-up visits will be
      performed to one year (2 weeks, 6 months, 12 months).
